At the age of 11, he left his parents’ home,where he lived in great poverty. Yosel, a teenage boy, decidedto go to the nearest city which was Czenstochova, where hefound a person who was willing to teach him to be a tailor.Yosel was a young and ambitious person, and very proud ofhaving a trade. He decided to become independent by open-ing a small tailor shop.The Second World War started on September 1, 1939. Yoselwas in Czenstochova and shared the same fate as all the Jevs^under the barbaric German occupational rules. All of hisfamily perished in the Holocaust. After the liquidation of thelarge ghetto, he was in the small ghetto and was working inHasag Pfelcem. He then was liberated on the 16th of January1945.After his liberation in Czenstochova, Yosel Zilberberg metMania Ickowicz. They got married and have two lovelychildren, a girl, Rosalie, and a boy, Jacob. They came toMontreal in 1948.Yosel Zilberbrg became an active member in the executiveof the Czenstochover Society of Montreal. He was active inthe Aid Committee.

It seemed only fitting that a community with oneof the largest Holocaust survivor populations in the world shouldfollow the lead of Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco and Detroitin erecting a Holocaust memorial that would stand as a perma-nent reminder to future generations of Nazi persecution, as wellas a symbol of the world’s indifference to genocide.330CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe last official Jewish burial, that of David Albert, took placeon May 3rd, 1970. In 1973 another (anonymous) interment tookplace, this one without official permit. Since 1973 the cemeteryfell victim to neglect, looting and vandalism.It is assumed that the first burial took place at the CzenstochovaCemetery circa 1799—1800. The grave of Izaak ben (son of)Moszek (Jews didn’t use last names at the time) was closelyguarded in fear of desecration until the death years later ofEleazer ben David. In 1803 there were no funerals. In 1805, twoJews died leaving behind no record. Year 1910 marks the deathof one of the richest Jews in Czenstochova, Szymon Gk)ldman. In1812 Wolf Landau was buried and in 1813 Pinchas Landau.Although unlisted in the publication “Jewish Cemeteries’’, theCzenstochova Cemetery is rated highly by scholars and re-searchers. It housed 4,500 tombstones around 20 of which datedto the early 19th century, circa 700, the latter part of the 19th cen-tury. About 3,000 were raised between 1900-1946, and 450 afterWorld War II.Among the tombstones executed prior to 1920 true works of artcan frequently be found which can provide valuable socio-histori-cal information for scholars, as well as serve as commemorativemonuments of what once constituted the Jewish-Polish culture.Along with the linguistic mosaic (inscriptions in Hebrew, Polish,Russian, German) the epitaphs are a source of invaluable demo-graphic information for students of the Jewish way of life. Themonuments of martyrs murdered in the Czenstochova ghetto orsymbolic graves of people annihilated in concentration camps arethere as a reminder of recent history.Moses Finkelstein representing the Board of the Jewish Organi-zation recently signed an agreement, relating to the cemeteryreconstruction. However, the concrete procedures connected withthe project are somewhat complicated, the sandstone tombstonesdisintegrated, the brick entrance gate collapsed, etc.The Foundry Czenstochova will rebuild the surrounding wall andthe collapsed gate. It will also provide the lighting to illuminatethe grounds.The City of Czenstochova undertook to construct a road fromZlota Street leading through a tunnel to the main gate.Since the mere road construction and electrical installations areestimated to take 3—4 years, the total renovation project may notbe realized until the first decade of the year 2000.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy329The Jewish CemeteryShall Be SalvagedReprinted from the Pohsh paper of Czenstochova*At the end of September 1990 the Legal Department of theCzenstochova Regional Office ratified a document establishingthe “Foundation in charge of the Reconstruction (rebuilding) ofthe Jewish Cemetery in Czenstochova and Protection of thehistorical remains (heirlooms) of the Jewish Culture”. Themembers of the Foundation are Jack Kremski, Arye Edelist andWolf Windman. The plan of action outlined by them contains thefollowing key issues:1) Commemorative plaques to be placed on the building of theNational Philharmonie (former synagogue), Hospital Rydygier(financed before the war by the Jewish community) and onGaribaldi Street (the area of the former ghetto).2) Establishment of a center of study and research of Jewishculture and customs.3) Renovation and rehabilitation of the Jewish Cemetery inCzenstochova.4) Publication of a monograph dealing with (or outlining) theJewish population in Czenstochova.The Foundation has many sponsors and benefactors who willfulfill various tasks of the programmed agenda, including thePresident of Czenstochova, who serves as its general coordinator.In the 1960s the cemetery was absorbed and devastated by theneighbouring industrial complex “Foundry Czenstochova” (thencalled Bierut Foundry). In 1981 the cemetery, ruined by pollutionand neglect, was fenced off and made accessible to outsidevisitors. Although there was no industrial activity on its grounds,only people with special permits and accompanied by a guidecould visit. Inspite of the existing restrictions, 63 foreign guestsvisited in 1987, 64 in 1988 and 17 in 1990.♦Translated from the RDlish by Lucy NiskerThe Fbundation to Restore the Cemetery and Heritage ofCzenstochova lays a wreath at the Warsaw Ghetto Monument, onAugust 13, 1989.BOOK COMMITTEE MEMBERSExecutive Members of the Czenstochover Social Clubof Miami, Florida:Willie Windman Morris Semsky Juluis JacobyPresident Vice President Financial SecretaryFrank Zaidman Abe Bomba Sidney SchwartzEntertainment Recording Secretary TreasurerMorris Wolf Morris Offman Harry KleinTrustee Trustee TrusteeCesia Jacoby Miriam SemskySunshine Secretary MembershipCZENSTOCHOV - Our Leeaoy327Mr. Schwartz presentsa '*Pikuach Nefesh*' plaqueto Mr WindmanMembers of theCzenstochover Social Club of MiamiDedicate Ambulance to IsraelReprinted from Broward Informer, April 17, 1986The Survivors of the Czenstochover Community of Polandhave chosen to donate an ambulance to the people of Israel asfitting memorial to those members of their community whoperished during the Holocaust.This purchase and donation was preceded by an extensive fund-raising drive undertaken by members of the Czenstochover SocialClub among survivors of Czenstochova from Dade, Broward andPalm Beach Counties in Florida, as well as throughout the coun-try. The purchase of this lifesaving gift represents the fruitionof the successful and meaningful efforts on the part of these sur-vivors, their friends and relatives.The ambulance was recently dedicated at a well-attended gatheringand collation held at Temple B’nai Zion, 200 178th Drive in MiamiBeach. Reflecting on the significance of this gift in saving livesin Israel were guest speakers, Robert L.

We are wellknown in the Jewish community for our activities andaccomplishments.The history of our organization begins in 1927, when a group ofChenstochover landsleit founded the Chenstochover Educa-tional Society. They came together to raise funds and support theKinderheim, as well as a home for the aged and other needs ofthe Jewish community in their old home town, Chenstochova,Poland. The Society continued its good work until frustrated bythe Holocaust.Fbllowing the war, there was a substantial influx of survivors fromChenstochova and other nearby areas of Poland to the Chicago-land region. Our organization grew and flourished, with new pur-pose and resolve. We became the Midwest Chenstochover Society,and our focus has continually been on charitable efforts andsupport for the Jewish community, the Jewish People, and theState of Israel.Our program includes regular and substantial fundraising effortsfor Magen David Adorn, the Jewish United Fund, Israel Bonds,and other Jewish charities and causes. We have donated a fully-equipped ambulance to Magen David Adorn, and in 1967, we builta First Aid Station located in Dimona, Israel, which we supportand maintain to this day. We have built a monument for our mar-tyrs from Chenstochova at the Waldheim Jewish Cemetery inChicago, in honor and commemoration of their lives and theliberation of our People from the Nazi concentration camps.

In a desert of disease andpoverty, many a child was spared the ravages of typhus, diph-theria, scarlet fever and rickets, so prevalent in the homes of thepoor working people of Czenstochova. It is said, “He who savesone life, is as if he saved the world”. The Czenstochover YoungMen and the Czenstochover Relief Committee saved the lives ofJewish children. Of all their great achievements, this is thegreatest.This noble work went on until the fateful year 1929. The year ofthe great depression that hit America. The members of our twoorganizations became themselves impoverished. Many lost theirjobs and became recipients of government relief. The help fromAmerica had stopped, and little by little, the Great Folkshulshrank. The classrooms became dark and grim reminders of aglorious past. Attendance grew smaller but the administratorsand the teachers did not give up. With superhuman efforts, theykept the school going, albeit in a diminished format. The schoollimped along until the terrible year of 1939. The Nazi murderersdid not spare our beloved school, and it shared the fate of theJewish people. A bright star on the firmament of Yiddish cultureshines no more. Just a few of us are left, old men and women leftin various corners of the world to recall its glory.

You will never beforgotten.EpilogueI was in Czenstochova, my home town, this year of 1988, thehundredth anniversary of my Society and the birth of my father.As I got off the train, I was on Pilsudski street, the street whereI was born and raised. A deep sadness overcame me as I looked- where is my street? Through tears, I saw decay and emptiness,neglected houses, darkness where once there was light. Whereis the happy noise of Jewish children playing? Where are storeslining the street? Where is Wigotski’s store where my mother us-ed to buy her groceries. (He used to charge next to nothing, hisway of helping a poor family.)Where are the crowds walking into the meeting hall of the“Bund”? Where is the Gordonia and the Bethar? Where is myboss, Mr. Weisblum, Reb Israel who blessed me on the day I leftfor America? Where is Mrs. Weisblum, who, every Friday at noon,brought down into the factory, a plate of the Sabbath soup for meCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legate315So the Jewish working people began building schools for theirchildren. Schools in which every subject would be taught inYiddish, a language they spoke and loved. But this seemed analmost impK)ssible task. The Polish authorities refused all finan-cial help, and so did the Jewish Community authorities (Gmineh),albeit for different reasons. Again the eyes of the Jewish poorturned to America, and the eyes of the poor of our home town turn-ed to New York - to the Czenstochover Young Men’s and ReliefCommittee, and they were not found wanting. A delegation ofmembers of both our organizations went to Czenstochova to finda suitable site, and start building. Members of the CzenstochoverYoung Men’s and Relief Committee set aside part of their meagerearnings for this all-important undertaking.And the building grew and grew, and was finished. It was abuilding such as a child of the ghetto had never seen. Fbr them,raised in one-room dwellings or dark basements, on streetswithout trees and flowers, the Fblkschool on Krutka streetnumber 23 was a revelation. The yard was roomy and airy. Color-ful peonies, crocuses and pansies planted all around, beautifiedthe yard. In the back of the yard, a small garden exuded pleasantaromas of green trees and shrubs. The children played there allday, and their pale faces took on color. Their weak lungs gainedstrength. Their rachitic legs began to straighten and a new Jewishchild was born — a happy, healthy and bright-eyed youngster, suchas the street of the River and the street of the Potters have neverseen.The school had three stories of large and bright classrooms.Teachers were brought in from such far-away cities as Grodno,Wilno and Bialystok. The teachers spoke in the beautiful cadencesof Lithuanian Yiddish, never heard in our environment. We listen-ed in awe and admiration to these wonderful, courageous anddevoted people, who started teaching such subjects, never heardby man or beast, as Yiddish grammar, physics, chemistry, geo-graphy, literature, arithmetic and art. The parents were p)Oor, andthey seldom, if ever, paid the tuition. Paid or not, these teachersstayed on their jobs. More often than not, coming to class hungry.(I remember once, in the laboratory, we were boiling a fish todetach the skeleton, which we were studying at the time. I wat-ched the teacher as he ate the discarded flesh of the fish.)During all this time, the Czenstochover Young Men’s and ReliefCommittee kept the school going. Beside money, there was Nes-tle milk for a cup of hot cocoa, warm fluffy underwear for the coldPolish winter, and shoes! Oh those beautiful American shoes, thedream of every Jewish child in the ghetto.I am deeply convinced that these tremendous efforts of theCzenstochover Young Men’s and Relief Committee not only pro-314CZENSTQCHOV - Our Legacyand pointed with his finger, “There! There he is.”, and turned backinto Crotona Park. I looked with bewilderment at the man myuncle had pointed out. It was August 1939, and New York was inthe throes of the biggest heat-wave in years. The street was bakingin the torrid sun. And there was this little man, pushing a tallbarrel, mounted on two wheels. At the side of the barrel wereaffixed a tall broom and a dust-pan. I watched Mr. Banoff as hewearily pushed the barrel. Occasionally he stopped, took off thebroom and pan, and started to sweep up little piles of dirt, whichhe dumped into the barrel. And so he pushed his burden, so smalland bent, sweat washing his sunburned face. I did not moveforward. I did not want to shame this man. Through eyes cloudedwith tears, I watched him turn into Bathgate avenue. I never spoketo him of his grateful brother. Perhaps it was just as well. Hitlercame and it didn’t matter anymore. Nothing mattered anymore.I still weep silently for Mr. Banoff and my shattered dream of thegolden land.The years passed and the “Czenstochover Young Men” keptgrowing. Despite restrictive immigration quotas, there was a con-tinuous flow of emigration from our home town, enough to replen-ish the ranks of our organization. The membership grew and sodid the scope of its activities. Cemetery plots were purchased, toextend the desire for togetherness even beyond the grave. Andlaws were established to use these cemeteries according to ourfaith.Extreme poverty became a way of life in our home town, and ourpeople there turned their hungry eyes to America. The Czensto-chover Young Men did not fail them: help, in all forms, kept onflowing to the people we left behind in our Old Home. It was asacrifice for many a member. Prosperity has not yet arrived inAmerica.With the enlightenment of the Jewish people, there arose a greatneed to educate the children of the Jewish poor. Compulsoryeducation was still a thing of the future. Only the rich had theirreligious and secular institutions of learning, privately admi-nistered and funded. A poor Jewish child had not a chance to entersuch a school. (My own parents could never read nor write.)For a thousand years, Jews spoke Yiddish, derided by its antago-nists and enemies as a worthless jargon. (Cecil Roth, in his“History of the Jews”, devotes about three paragraphs to theJewish language.) The Jewish masses kept on speaking it in everincreasing numbers. Jewish literature came into full bloom, withthe appearance of Mendele Mosher Sphorim, Sholem Aleichem,Peretz and others, who wrote in Yiddish. The creation of a Yiddishschool system became imperative.CZENSTOCHOV ~ Our I^jgacy313*'Tribes of the wandering and weary breast.How shall ye flee away and be at rest!The wild dove hath her nest, the Fbx his cave.Mankind their country — Israel but the grave.**Who was this Hershl Grynszpan? Who was this HershlGrynszpan, this child of the ghetto, this eighteen-year-old boywith the curly earlocks and long kapoteh? By what magic of erudi-tion and inborn intelligence did he turn away from the pages ofthe Talmud to cast his eye to the verses of Lord Byron? Tb remindme, the blessed one, who was going to America: Do not forget myfriend, you are going to the “Goldeneh Medineh”. But we are still,all of us, in exile.In 1888, the eighteen men of Czenstochova founded our Society.The founding of the Society was an inevitable result, given thedevotion of the Czenstochover to their families and friends in the“Old Home” and to their Landsleit in New York. Their aim wasto keep in contact by having regular meetings, help one anotherfinancially, and help the people they left behind. (Acquisition ofcemetery plots came later.)The beginnings were modest: there was a ten-cents-a-weekmembership tax. But, so were the founders — no arrogant intellec-tuals, no people of property or wealth. Just simple working people,imbued with the high ideals of the Jewish working class, and tohelp one’s brother, here, and in the old home, when in fact, noneof them could truly afford it.Before one emigrated to America, it was customary to visit friendsand kin in their houses to say good-bye, and collect addresses oftheir kin in New York. When one arrived in New York, one lookedthem up and gave regards.On the street of the butchers, lived a poor seller of thread. WhenI was a boy of fifteen and apprenticed to a tailor, my boss usedto send me there to buy thread, making sure that I took alongsome empty spools on which to wind the thread. I went to saygood-bye to this man. Before I left, he gave me the address of hisbrother in the Bronx, with the words: “My brother’s name thereis Abe Banof f. But you know, when he was still here, he was AvromPacanowski. Amerike Gannef! My brother must be now in ‘dihoyche fenster’ in America. Thank my brother for the money hesends, and tell him that without his help, I would be out ofbusiness.”When I arrived in the Bronx, I asked my uncle to take me to Mr.Banoff. “I can’t take you to Mr. Banoff’s house”, said my uncle.“He lives too far, but I will take you to his place of work.” Wecrossed Crotona Park and came to Pulton street. My uncle stopped312CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe streets of the ghetto were narrow and mostly unpaved, withdeep mud in summer and deeper snow in the winter. Crooked lit-tle houses lined both sides of the street. The little houses wereold and bent to the ground, as if in prayer. Somehow, these littlehouses never fell. They stood old and proud even when hordes ofsoldiers from the nearby camp invaded the streets of the ghettoduring a pogrom. The soldiers pushed their bayonets into littleJewish windows, and hacked away at the houses. The little, oldhouses held - the houses and the Jews: both stubborn — bothsurviving.As time passed by, the Jewish population kept growing. Fed byan increasing stream of Jews wandering in from the little villagesand townships that surrounded Czenstochova, villages andtownships with the most wondrous Jewish names: Vloin, Dzurik,Klobuck Ovepole, Meriv and many others. The incoming Jewspressed hard against the ghetto walls into adjoining streets. FromRiver street, from Potters street and the Street of the Goats, theyflowed into the Warsaw, Kracow and Garden streets. And, to thestreet named after Marshall Pilsudski, the great friend of theJews.Czenstochova blossomed with the vitality of Jewish life of culture,industry and commerce. There were a hundred little houses ofprayer, and two synagogues. From the yeshivos and houses ofstudy could be heard the chanting of the Talmud: the sweet songsof the ages. The Jewish people of our town lived in peace, observedtheir holidays and the holy Sabbath. The streets of the ghettosmelled of fresh-baked challah and rye bread. Early Friday mor-nings, the fishers pulled out of the river the heavy wooden crates,full of live carp, pike and perch, to sell to Jewish women for theadornment of the Sabbath table. A sweet sound could be heardin the streets of the ghetto: the ringing of brass on brass, as thewomen were pounding pestle on mortar to crush the cinnamonand vanilla sticks for the Sabbath cakes and pies.On the Sabbath morning, a holy silence descended on the streetsof the ghetto. The Sabbath was queen. A queen to all. To the oldand the young, the rich and the poor. The Sabbath was universaland eternal.I have a little memory-book, such as one used to buy before “Goingto America”. A little book with covers of wood, on which there wasusually a carving of a Polish mountaineer. In this little book,friends and relatives inscribed expressions of love, good wishesand farewells, with little poems and proverbs, imploring at thesame time: “When you cross the great sea, do not let the waterwash away your memory. Remember us, and help us!” In thisbook, it was my friend, Hershl Grynszpan, who penned theselines:CZENSTOCHOV — Our Legacy311One Hundred Years ofCzenstochover Young MenREFLECTIONS. ...By Kopel LedermanThis year, 1988, we are celebrating the 100th anniversary ofthe Czenstochover Young Men. A whole century has passed, sincea small group of eighteen young Jewish men, former inhabitantsof a small town in the south-west of Poland called Czestochova,gathered at the corner of Delancey and Norfolk streets, all recentarrivals to the teeming lower east side of New York. They gatheredto talk of their hard life here, in this Golden Land. Of the airlessand sunless environment in the crowded tenements. Of the ter-rible conditions in the dark and dank sweatshops, where onespent the hours of daylight hunched over the sewing machine,pumping the foot pedal ever faster and faster, to bring home thetwo or three dollars a week to feed wife and children.Yes! Life was hard, and the foreman in the sweatshop wasruthless in his demands: “Paster! Paster, Greenhorn, or you willwind up in the street!“ But when these eighteen young men cametogether after a days’ work at the corner of Delancey and Nor-folk, their talk was cheerful and their hopes high: “We will makeit in this America, and if we will not make it, our children will.America is free for all. With G—d’s help, we will get our childrenout of the tenements and sweatshops.’’Eighteen means life. And so did these eighteen young tailors,cigar makers, peddlers and street cleaners, dream of a better life.And they talked of their home town.Czenstochova was a town young immigrants could not easilyforget. The town was beautiful, with that quiet beauty of thePohsh countryside. Three wide boulevards, lined with statelyhouses and elegant store-fronts, shaded by great chestnut trees,where every autumn Jewish children came to gather chestnutsto decorate the Succot booths. Then came the new and the oldmarkets leading into the ghetto, nestled along our beloved river:The Warta.310CZENSTOCHOV - Our LeThe Officers of the Czenstochover Society and Relief Committeein New York are (as in July 1992):President  Murray MruvkaVice President  Morry MarkuseTreasurer Stefa MarkuseFinancial Secretary Esther LedermanRecording Secretary Kopel LedermanTrustee  Hyman RotensteinTrustee  Rubin HerschTrustee Walter LublinskiCemetry Chairman Louis LazarovitchCemetery Chairman Leon GongolaEntertainment Chairman Zev SilbergleithOur Society is one of the oldest Benevolent Societies in the UnitedStates.

There was nobody leftfor us to help.Today our Society has taken on a new look and agenda of philan-thropic activities. Most of our members now are holocaust sur-vivors. Most of the charities and contributions are directed to theState of Israel in many forms: Israel Bonds, Defense Forces,Magen David Adorn, Disabled Soldiers, Library and Kindergarten.The Kindergarten in Qfar Saba was funded by our Society. At thistime, to do justice to history, I cannot fail to note that ourmembers, Anne and Jack Kremski, have on their own accord andwith their own funds, built a fine park for children in the city ofTel Aviv. Contributions are also made to local Jewish organiza-tions and individuals (U. J.A. and others).Ours is an aging membership. For generations our Society replen-ished it’s waning membership from a small but steady flow ofimmigrants from our Home Town. Today, there is only the silenceof death and desolation in Jewish Czenstochova.For years our Society has made efforts to induce the children ofour members, the so-called Second Generation, to join our ranksin The Society, but except for a few, we have failed. The blame can’tbe fixed on anyone. It is more the fault of the conditions that nowprevail in the Jewish communities in America, and the flight ofthe Jews to the suburbs and the Florida sun.Some of us still cling to our beliefs and to old friends, the “Lastof the Mohicans’’.

The so-called “Landsmanshaftn”, founded mostlyby immigrants from Eastern Europe — in order to— help the new immigrant members to acclimatize themselves inthis “New Gk^lden Land”;— to lend the members in need some money;— buy cemetery plots for “Yber hundert un tzvantzik”;— and call weekly or monthly meetings, so as not to lose contactwith the old dear friends from the same home town, the beloved“Alte Heim”,Our Society was founded in 1888. In the beginning the member-ship was poor. They worked long hours in the sweat-shops, forthree dollars a week. They lived a misrable life in the steamingtenements of the lower east side; but they never forgot their HomeTown and the terrible poverty of the people they left behind. Poorthemselves, they kept on sending continuous help to their HomeTown: Matzos for Passover and help for other Holidays. They sentbooties and warm underwear for children and practically savedtheir lives in the cold, dark Pblish winters. But the greatestachievement of “Gzenstochover Young Men”, (former name of theSociety) was the building of The Yiddish Fblk School in Czensto-chova. It was a three-story building, the most beautiful of all theelementary schools in Czenstochova. In this school, where all thesubjects were taught in Yiddish, the child of the poorest of thepoor came for an education and found a warm home and modernteaching, from A.B.C. to algebra. I am proud to say that I attend-ed and graduated from this wonderful school, and will be gratefulto the end of my days to the devoted teachers, who taught me rightfrom wrong, and to The Gzenstochover Society which built theschool. This great work of charity went on unabated until thatVIIIU.S.A.Czenstochover Communityof New YorkSocial and Cultural ActivitiesCZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyWith the coming of Purim 1943, which symbolizes victory of theJews over their enemies, the Germans did not hestitate to takerevenge for their victory. They devised a scheme to fool theremaining intelligentsia, promising them that the Third Reichhad negotiated an agreement with the International Red Crosspermitting their resettlement in Palestine. Doctors, engineers,lawyers and bookkeepers presented themselves, including thepresident of the Jewish Community Council, Morris Kopinskyand family. TEu:paulin covered trucks, marked with the Red Crosswere provided for transport. Instead of Palestine, they were takento the Jewish cemetery, where gendarmes with machine guns andopened graves awaited them. Only one person survived, Kopin-sky’s son, who jumped from a truck.The Jewish underground carried out a death sentence on twotraitors. They were read their sentences and were executed on thesp)Ot. The sentences were placed in a bottle and buried with thetwo traitors in the Talmud Torah building.As the result of the treachery, preparations for the Jewish uprisingdid not come to fruitation. The houses in which the arsenal wasstored, together with their heroic occupants were dynamited bythe Germans. The street where this uprising was being preparedwas Nadrzeczna Ulica.Czenstochova, before the war, had a Jewish population of betweenthirty-six and thirty-seven thousand, with a vibrant, well organiz-ed Jewish community. The Community Council (“Gemine”) con-ducted democratic elections for Council Members (“Dozers”) andPresident of the Council. The council was concerned with thewelfare and health of the Jewish populace and clergy. It supportedthe Jewish hospital and orphanage as well as providing financialsupport for the indigent. We also had branches of organizedpolitical parties and factions; professional organizations andunions; and an organized workers’ movement; sport clubs; amusic club with its own orchestra (LIRA); a health clinic (TOZ);as well as Yeshivas and Rabbis. And all of us present were partof Jewish Czenstochova of which we are proud.Dear friends, in memory of Jewish Czenstochova we gathertogether to have this Yizkor. With bowed heads and in deepsadness, we pay our respects to our martyrs, holy ones and theirfamilies and do honour to their memory.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leg^acytration camps. The accommodations and working conditions arewell known to you. I believe you remember the deprivation of civilliberties and the degradation to this day.Those persons who presented themselves to the First Alejagathering point were herded to loading ramps and loaded like cat-tle into barred cattle cars without water, sanitary facilities andwithout seating, locked up and sent to Treblinka. Those whopassed out, were exhausted or died en route were unloaded. Whatawaited our dear ones? You and I know well... gas and crematoria.The coldblooded monsters had established different work details.One detail emptied the abandoned housing and apartments of allpossessions and goods of the departed Jews. The Gtermans con-verted the residences on Garibaldi Street into warehouses and theremaining Jews sorted, packed and shipped the goods to Germany.In the abandoned houses, the Germans discovered hidden Jewsin make-shift bunkers. The terrified souls they uncovered wereshot on the spot.Massive executions were carried out on the site of the destroyedGrerman Synagogue. Amongst those shot at this location were theCantor Rishel and his family.At the intersection of Krutka and Waty Streets was anotherexecution place. Amongst the murdered was my father, JosefShaje Wajsberg, bless his soul. The murderers chose men as a“transport kommando” to collect the bodies and transport themto a previously prepared open mass grave at Kawa Street.It’s worth to recall, that a member of the Jewish underground(resistance), Fishlewicz from Radomsk, attempted to shootHauptmann (Captain) Rohn during a selection at Rynek Warszaw-ski. However, his pistol, purchased from Polish undergroundsources, the “A.K.” (Armia ELrajowa), failed to work. He and everytenth person at the selection were shot in reprisal. Amongst thoseshot was an old member of the Bund, Harshel Friman, a notedachiever for the Jewish working class. Another heroic event oc-curred at Rakow Railroad: The Jewish underground blew up afully loaded troop train en route to the Eastern Front. In reprisal,the Germans took every tenth person of the kommando at Ost-Bahnhof and Rakow and shot them. Among them was my com-rade, Icek Dorenfeld.On the 5th of January 1943, the remaining working men of thesmall ghetto, performing what was known as the useful or neededoccupations and their women and small children were gatheredby the Germans and sent to Radomsko. Together with the Ra-domsk women and children there were sufficient persons to makeup a full transport to Treblinka. This was the last transport fromCzenstochova to Treblinka.304CZENSTOCHOV - Our LeffaqyA Yizkor Speechto the Second GenerationBy Benjamin WaisbergA History OF the Jews by Solomon Grayzel is considered to beone of the best books on Jewish history, comprising 760 pages.Only one half page is devoted to the hquidation of European Jewry.Imagine, how future historians will deal with the Holocaust’sobliteration (or annihilation) of six million Jews! I appeal to youesteemed landsleit, to pass on to your children your survivalexperiences of the war years as a testament to them, so that theinnocent blood of our mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, andchildren should not be forgotten.Dear friends, how can we be at this Yizkor and not go back inthought, to the Yom Kippur of 1942? Our fathers and motherswere in holy places fasting and praying for a good year to come.However, like lightning and thunder, the news spread that Son-derkommandos, hooligans in black uniforms, had encircled andblockaded the ghetto. We felt as if our chests were in a vice andwe choked as if a black cloud was suspended in the air. We askedourselves where to flee and to whom. However, we Jews had nofriends outside the ghetto.By night the Jewish police notified us to be prepared for resettle-ment (repatriation) and to take with us twenty kilograms ofclothing and food for a two day journey. At six o’clock in the mor-ning came the second order: those Jews who have work permitsshould register at the “Metalurgia”. Those without work permitsmust present themselves at the First Aleja and be prepared fora two day journey. At the “Metalurgia” we were welcomed withbatons; we were herded and beaten and our work permits wereconfiscated and destroyed. Those arrivals at the “Metalurgia” whowere not admitted, were driven by the pohce (Pohsh, Ukrainian,German, Estonian, and Lithuanian) to the resettlement point. Inthe “Metalurgia” we formed into rows and were driven to differentwork locations: “Hagen East Railroad, HASAG Pfelzern, HASAGRakow, Czestochowianka, and Warta”, the future sites of concen-CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy3031939, The Year of CrisisThe most critical year of all was 1939. The Second World Warbegan with its blitz and annihilation, the skies became dark withterror and the foreboding spectre of the enforced ghetto arose overmillions of Jews. The beginning already presaged something ofwhat was to come: the destruction of the Jewish community ofEastern Europe and the decimation of the Jews of WesternEurope.Officers for 1940 were elected by acclamation: Mr. Kamanpresident and A. Weinstock vice-president. Aided by the admini-stration and executive they gave the society their devotedleadership.In 1941 certain changes took place in the composition of theexecutive and committees. A. Weinstock was elected president andPrank Gtoldfarb vice-president.In 1946 a new name appeared in the masthead of the society, thatof Izzy Feldman the new president; L. Sedlovsky was vice-president.One of the meetings took up the question of approving theerection of a monument in memory of the martyrs of Czensto-chova to be located at the entrance to the cemetery.1954-1964Years of Growth Under New ConditionsElections for the year 1954 again brought new blood. The officerswere K. Tarnofsky, president; S. Geller, vice-president.The Last Five YearsThe chief officers in the year 1960 were the same: S. Abrams,president; G. Bialik, vice-president.New officers were elected in 1964: H. Kaman, president; S. Yaku-bowitz, vice-president.And, speaking of the future, may there prevail among the Czen-stochover the same spirit of intimacy and friendliness and maythey not remain backward in their contributions to the State ofIsrael through all Welfare Institutions whether they be local,national or international. May we extend the traditional wish of“double” strength (ko I’chai) to the fiftieth Jubilee and to a won-derful and bright future for all.302CZENSTOCHQV - Our Leg^&cy1925-1930These were quiet years according to the society’s veterans. Thesociety’s affairs progressed in a routine and satisfactory manner.The presidents were: H. Honickman 1924; M. Tamofsky, 1925-26;M. Caplan for a third time 1927-28; A. Richtiger, 1929; M. Teir-nofsky, 1930.The society assisted Jewish schools both religious and secular,Hebraist and Yiddishist. Assistance was given to the projectwhich brought Jewish war orphans from the Ukraine to Canadain 1926.1930-1939These were the years of economic crisis, difficult years for theworld which were reflected in Jewish life. The new Poland whicharose after the war provided no hope for the Jews. The only solu-tion was to emigrate. But where?The USA had closed its doors and set up the quota system. Jewslooked for new emigration opportunities and found some, albeitlimited, in the Latin American countries and in Canada. But theeconomic depression had penetrated here too — it could not beescaped.The depression had provoked tension but M. Tarnofsky, who waspresident from 1930 to 1932, made great efforts to preserve uni-ty His successor, I. Redness who assumed the chair in 1933, con-tinued along the same lines.The ominous year 1933 had its tragic repercussions across theworld. The Hitler decrees and the anti-Jewish manifestations inother countries provoked demonstrations to awaken the con-science of the world. A local committee was formed to help thevictims of Nazism and the Chenstochover Society took its placeon this committee.In that tumultous year D. Finer was elected president and JacobLubek recording secretary. His minutes, incidentally, present aclear record of the reaction of the Society to the events of the day.In 1934-1935 M. Tarnofsky again assumed the presidency andHarry Garelick was vice-president. D. Danziger was treasurer,D. Bemholtz was named chairman of a special committee to carryon relief work. Despite the economic severity and the difficultyin raising dues and money, he succeeded in raising the Society’scontributions to relief work and aid.For the year 1936 D. Finer was elected as president for the secondtime and A. Appelbaum as vice-president.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy301Gzenstochover Aid SocietyA Chapter of Jewish Communal Activities in TorontoThe BeguilingThe Society was founded on December 18th, 1914, in the houseof the first secretary Hersh-Wolf Switzer at 51 Baldwin Street.Founder and first president was Joe Bochnek. The founders andfirst members were “landsleit” who had already organized an aidsociety to collect funds for the war victims of their native town.They found it difficult, however, to maintain an organization solelyfor this purpose. The money had to be put in reserve to bedistributed after the war was over when contact could be estab-lished. The 60 members saw that an organization had to be setup which they could maintain on a permanent basis and whichwould provide constant content and contact, an organizationwhich would do both relief work for overseas and mutual assis-tance here on a fraternal basis.In 1916 when A. Winter was named president the society advancedto new achievements. Meetings were held at the 2^onist Instituteof that day at 206 Beverley Street. Each meeting brought some-thing new and the group expanded in depth and in breadth. Thetreasury grew, sick benefits were extended and cemetery plotswere acquired. A constitution was drafted.The Post-World War I YearsIn this crucial period the presiding officers were the late S. Shrott;in 1919 his successor was M. Caplan. After this year the semi-annual election system was dropped. In 1920 Joe Rubin waselected president. He was followed by B. Jacobs, and the lateKalman Shiff. Both of whom strove to interest the members incommunal obligations. The latter even wanted the society to takea stand in the then current kashruth dispute, though the mem-bership successfully maintained their neutrality.In 1923 M. Caplan was re-elected and he was instrumental inorganizing a women’s auxiliary — which has been a constantasset to the society’s growth and development.300CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe Presidents of the Czenstochover Aid Societyfor the Past 75 YearsI.

Their almost total absence is notonly a loss for our generation of survivors, but a loss for mankindand for Jews everywhere, for generations to come.We say we know what happened in the Holocaust of the 20thcentury. We recall that six million died, and we think of theuncounted millions left maimed in body and in spirit. We say weknow, because we can record fact and deed, and can list the namesof our loved ones in the Yad v’Shem of our hearts. We grow bitter,when we encounter those today who lie and say it never happened— who say so either because they cannot face the truth or - farworse — who say, it never happened, because they want to makeit happen again.We do know what happened. What we do not know — what nobodycan explain — is why it happened. For us as Jews, of course, theNazi Holocaust has special significance. This was to be the “FinalSolution”. Not a Jew was to be left in the world — not a Jew inGermany or Austria, or France, or Britain, or Russia, or America.Not a Jew anywhere in the world.The period of the European Holocaust causes some Jews, espe-cially among the younger generation, feelings of uneasiness andeven of guilt. The question has often been asked: Why did theJews go like lambs to the slaughter, instead of putting up aresistance? The question has only one answer: Whoever asks itshows ignorance and a lack of understanding of what actuallyhappened in Europe during World War II. Today, in retrospect, weare beginning to grasp the power of the forces of evil at work then.At the time, however, nobody in his wildest dreams could haveimagined that human beings were capable of what the Germansdid.But to return to the question: Why did the Jews not revolt? Theanswer is clear. During World War II the Germans killed over 20million people of various nationalities. We heard hardly anythingof revolt from them. Apparently it was made almost impossibleto resist physically and if this was true of the gentiles who dweltin their own countries and possessed armies and armaments, itwas even truer of the Jews. The Jews, after all, constituted aminority and to a large extend an alien element in the countriesof Europe.286CZENSTOCHOV - Our LesCBcyOur Story Must Not Die with Us,but Live on ForeverBy Harry KleinA speech made at a Yizkor Memorialin Montreal on November of 1986Dear Friends,We gather again, to pay tribute together to our dear ones, whoperished in the Holocaust, and to the Six Million Kedoshim, torecite Kaddish and to remember. We remind others who mighttend to forget and we pass on the legacy of a tragic and heroic pastto our future generations.In the past 40 years, much has been written about the cruelty ofthe Nazis, about the annihilation of millions of Jewish men,women and children. We have learned of the destruction of hun-dreds of Jewish communities, and of how the world stood by,allowing it all to happen. We know of how the Jews rose up andresisted the Nazis all over Europe, both actively and passively, howthey fought in the camps, in the ghettos, and the forests, and weknow of the heroism of the martyrs of the Warsaw Ghetto.A substantial body of literature already exists in many languagesabout the Holocaust and Resistance. But this is a mere fractionof the story. Ask any survivor, who went through the Holocaustexperience and he will tell you that there is yet much more to tell.Each survivor has something new to add. The complete story hasnot yet been told, perhaps it never can be.Fbr us, the survivors of the Holocaust, this day of commemorationserves not only to evoke memories, but also as a reminder, thatinside each of us there is a part of ourselves that shall forever re-main destroyed.Fbrty-two years after the Holocaust, which inflicted on our peoplethe greatest tragedy in our national history, we still live with thepainful sense of bereavement which we cannot and shall not over-come. We still cannot free ourselves of the sadness and sorrow thathas become a part of our lives. Only now we begin to grasp the fullCZENSTOCHQV - Our Legacy285historical one, with speakers delivering talks which brought usback to pre-war Czenstochova and the destruction of its Jewishcommunity (Kehilah).TraditionThose members of the Society who regularly devoted their timeand energy carrying out various functions, continued working intheir roles over the years in what seemed to become a tradition.Some of the executive members who originally began to lead theannual Yizkor Memorial Service continued to fulfill this duty eachyear. Eventually it became a tradition to them. The speakers re-mained constant for many years: Dr. Benjamin Orenstein, HarryKlein, Szlomo Waga, Berl Ickowicz, Harry Rosenblum, TedZilbert.The 22nd Yizkor Service was held on October 4, 1970. Thepresident, Lajbke Jakubowicz, opened the Yizkor Academy andHarry Klein, the chairman of the event, led the Yizkor, followedby the speakers. Dr. Benjamin Orenstein and Harry Rosenblum.The Life That Is No MoreA hundred years ago, the majority of the world's Jews lived inEurope in the Polish provinces of the Russian empire, in theAustro-Hungarian Empire, and in the German Empire. Tb besure, it was a world of poverty and hardship, of sacrifice andstruggle, but it was also a world of scholars and poets, ofimpressionable matchmakers and philosophers. It was a worldwhere each week men and women confronted new perils andhazards, and where each Sabbath they sat with their childrenaround a table surrounded by song and joy. It was a world ofsynagogues and houses of study where young and old crowdedtogether by the candlewick to study late into the night; wheremothers and grandmothers rocked their loved ones to sleep withlullabies of hope and faith; where a neighbor's joy was a shietl'sday of rejoicing, and where his pain was its day of sorrow. Itwas a world where the price of respect was good deeds, butwhere the right to friendship had no prerequisites. Such aworld were these 10,000 tiny dots on the map — Belz, where theHasid hurried to be at his rebbe's table; Vilna, where theordinary cobbler conversed in the Talmud; Pnsk and Lodz,where vendors rose at the crack of dawn on Monday andThursday to hurray their wares to the marketplace; there wasWarsaw, where writers leisurely sipped tea, and interpreted thelife of the times. . . Vienna, her parks and broad streetsbustling with artists etching out moments of memory andviolinists transforming cafes into symphonic halls...284CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyYizkor Service in Memory of the MartyrsThe First Yizkor AcademyThe seventh Yizkor in the memory of the martyrs was organizedby the Czenstochover Committee of Montreal and took place onSunday, February 17, 1948.The religious ceremony was conducted by Cantor A. Matz. RabbiDr. Ch. Denberg gave a speech on the theme, “The duty of theJewish people at the present moment”. George Klein dedicatedan address to the Czenstochover Jewish Community and themartyrs. The legal advisor, Leon Krystal, made a moving appealfor reconstructive financial aid to the survivors of the Holocaust.The two delegates from the Czenstochover Society of Toronto,David Birenholtz and Harry Goldberg, expressed their thanks fororganizing a Czenstochover Society in Montreal. A. Myerowiczand Sz. Grund spoke of the deceased Nora Klein. Grund read apoem about the genocide of the European Jews written by NoraKlein prior to her death. The guest speaker, Mr. R. Federman ofNew York, spoke in detail about the life and the tragic calamityof the Jewish Community and the Holocaust Survivors. Mr. HarryBerk was the Chairman of this very impressive Yizkor Academy.One of the principal tasks of our society was to ensure the memoryof martyrs (kedoshim) who perished in the Holocaust. The new-ly elected executive of the Czenstochover Society began its activityat the end of 1948. The first item on the agenda was to organizea “Yizkor memorial service” which was to be held in 1949.As of 1949, the Yizkor services were held in the Workman CircleCentre, Jewish Public Library, the Zionist Movement Centre andin the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Congregation.The speakers of the Memorial Yizkor Academies were: Dr.Benjamin Orenstein, Rabbi Benjamin Borzikowski, SzlomoWaga, Harry Klein, Kuba Goldberg, Harry Rosenblum, BerekIckowicz and Ted Zilbert. The memorial service was conductedin two parts: the first, a religious one with six candle lights andthe memorial prayers for the martyrs, the second part, anCZENSTOCHOV - Our Lefcacy283Ruth Klein Tatner, Joyce Nisker Thkefman, Aaron Dudkiewicz,Evelyn Kaxtus Solomon, Susan Wallace Ship and Cypora AltmanLeb.We are all extremely proud to have supported Mr. Klein in writingthis book which traces our roots and opens doors to catch a last-ing glimpse of the life of our ancestors in Czenstochova. This bookis a compilation of records, memorabilia and photos of ourheritage, past and present, which will create a legacy for ourfuture generations.282CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacySo It Shall Be Written; So It Must Be Told . . .By the Executive Committee of the First and Second Generationof Czenstochover Holocaust Survivors of MontrealGrowing up in the 1950s and ‘60s, we were the baby-boomers.We represented the hopes and aspirations of our parents who sur-vived the horrific atrocities of the Holocaust.Yet, many of us were raised in very protected environments, wherehistory was only whispered. As our parents clung to their “lands-men” for moral and social support, their children, for the mostpart, were excluded from this interaction. We were shielded fromtheir wartime experiences which was their sorrow to carry.It came as a surprise in the late 1970s when many of us wereinvited to become involved in the Czenstochova Society. Until then,our only contact was as spectators, watching our parents leaveto attend meetings, bond drives, bazaars, dinner—dances. Eventheir annual Yizkor service was limited to their own generation.They did not want to upset the children.However, as we matured into adults and the survivors nearedretirement age, they realized that they must share their past withus, or it would remain untold. Moreover, they desired a continuityto their Society, to maintain their cemetery and their cherishedmonument, dedicated to those Czenstochovers who perished inthe Holocaust.In Montreal, we were a small group. Many of our peers had leftQuebec. Mostly out of respect for our parents, we began to par-ticipate in meetings in the early 1980s. We planned several suc-cessful events: in 1982, a three-generation picnic; in 1987, adinner—dance. It was not until 1990 that we became particularlyinquisitive about our roots. Although a book about the MontrealCzenstochover group had been published in Yiddish during the1960s, most of us were unable to read and understand it.As a dynamic leader, Harry Klein formed a book committee inorder to publish a book in English about the history of the Jewishcommunity of Czenstochova. The committe was comprised ofHarry Klein, Harry Rosenblum, Lucy Nisker, Morris Szwimer,Mr. & Mrs. Harry Klein and Mrs. & Mrs. Berel Ickowicz at theCzenstochover Liberation Party of the Miami Social Club.CZENSTOCHOVER OF MONTREALFrom the left (top): A.

The reading of such messages would leave a deep impres-sion and would serve to strengthen our ties with otherCzenstochover Landsleit.At the 15th Yizkor Memorial Service in New York (which is con-sidered to be the largest center of Czenstochover in the world),a message was sent by the Montreal executive members whichread as follows: “lb the Czenstochover Relief Committee andLadies Auxiliary in New York: Dear Landsleit. Together with youwe deeply grieve the tragedy of the destruction of the JewishCommunity of Czenstochova which was the 8th largest in Poland,and the loss of those who perished in the Holocaust, together withall the others comprising the 6 million Jewish Martyrs. Our feel-ings of great loss and sadness are shared and, therefore, we haveto be strong and proud that the Czenstochover Jewish people willnever be forgotten for their heroic resistance in the struggle withthe Nazi barbarians. We must never forgive or forget, in ourthoughts, the cruel days of the Nazi atrocities against the Jewishpeople.’ ’FairweU ReceptionsA get-together was organized by the FairweU Committee for thosefamilies who planned to move away from Montreal. The firstfairwell reception was held for Mr. and Mrs. Kuba Goldberg whowere moving to New York. The celebration was held in the ZionistMovement Centre on Esplanade. Many came to honor the Goldbergsand congratulatory speeches were made in a lively atmosphere.Dr. Grenstein and his wife presented a humorous program. Othersuch events took place, honoring the Buchwalter family, whomoved to Toronto and the Peper family, who moved to New York.An impressive evening of slight variation was the fairwell toMr. and Mrs. Waga, who moved to Toronto. This event was com-bined with activities including the election of a new executivecommittee and the review of two books, one by Dr. Orenstein,“Chorban-Czenstochov” in Latin transcription, and the other byMr. Waga, “Chorban Czenstochov” in Yiddish.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leffaoy277bears the photo of the Synagogue. You deserve the greatestrecognition for that marvelous idea which serves as a symbol ofour great Jewish community of Czenstochova. That considerationproves the importance of your activities. Thank you and I wisheveryone a Happy Passover.''The content of the letters demonstrates the strong interest of ourLandsleit who were seeking some practical and moral support intheir difficult times.Sick and WelfareThe Landsmanshaft, being faithful to the traditions of theirparents in Czenstochov, considered the visiting of a sick landsmanto be a great Mitzvah (good deed). Such a visit, by a delegationof his landsleit, had a positive psychological effect on the person’srecovery. The same support was being shown by the Financial AidCommittee. An answer to the call for help was always available.Czenstochover Landsleit in IsraelThe contact with the Czenstochover Society in Tel-Aviv, Israel, hassignificant meaning for our landsleit in Israel to whom we directlysend financial support. Despite the restraints in carrying outlarge projects, we continued to offer our financial support. Thenecessity of assisting them which was of great importance, was shownby the many letters of recognition and thanks in our files. Eachletter from Czenstochover landsmen in Israel is in itself anhistoric document and reflects the activities among ourCzenstochover landsleit everywhere. It is a symbol of the once-upon-a-time Jewish Community in Poland, destroyed in theHolocaust.Czenstochova in North AmericaThe Czenstochover Aid Society of Toronto has been in regular con-tact with the Landsmanshaft of Montreal. Information of impor-tant decisions is officially reported by mail. In 1959, when theexecutive in Toronto decided to build a Medical Centre in Israel,an official letter was sent to the Czenstochover Society inMontreal.In 1957, Dr. Benjamin Orenstein was invited to Toronto as guestspeaker at the 15th Yizkor Memorial Service. Later that evening,he was invited to attend an important executive meeting to dis-cuss future actions towards the creation of new projects.The Czenstochover Society of Montreal is in contact with theLandsmanshaften and Aid Societies throughout the world. It hasbeen a practice for these Societies to send a message to the Yizkor276CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegucyFrom our ArchivesThe Ladies Auxiliary of theCzenstochover SocietyA very important group in the Landsmanshaft has been theLadies Auxiliary, most of them wives of the executive members.Apart from graciously hosting society meetings, these ladies werestrongly involved in annual fund-raising activities, such as theBazaar and “money shower”. The funds raised were used to sup-port Israel as well as others in need of assistance. They main-tained a special book to register the demands for financialsupport.

They were instrumental in helping us rebuild our shat-tered lives, after we survived the Holocaust.It was not an easy task for us Czenstochovers who arrived inMontreal after the war, but we were determined to keep alive thetraditions of our parents who perished.To begin with, I would like to talk about a landsman who livedin Montreal for many years. When we arrived, we found his houseopen to all of us. He was Yecheskel Silver, the first president ofthe Czenstochover Society. He was a great help to those whosought his advice and he was devoted to helping us until the lastminutes of his life.Our next president was Lajbke Jakubowicz, known lovingly to usall as “Feter Lajbke”. Always the first to arrive at an executivemeeting and the last to leave, he was truly a remarkableindividual.Berel Ickowicz, who was Chairman of the Society for many years,showed great interest and determination in offering his advice forthe good of our Society, until he moved with his family to Toronto.Symcha Silver (Zylberberg), as Secretary, took upon himself toinform all our members of the Society’s activities and to encour-age everyone’s participation. Through our joint activities, webecame very good friends.It was also our great privilege to have Dr. Benjamin Orenstein asour General Secretary and top advisor. I had the pleasure to workwith Dr. Orenstein on our project of publishing a Yiddish book,sponsored by the Czenstochover Society. Dr. Orenstein publishedthe book in 1965.Teddy Zilbert, supported by his wife Dorka, was our Public Relationsperson. Thanks to their active involvement in our activities andtheir great efforts in fund-raising campaigns, organized by theLadies Auxiliary, these campaigns were always a great success.Harry Rosenblum, as Chairman of the first and second generationCzenstochover Survivors, has been very effective in all hisendeavors. With particular reference to our yearly Yizkor service,he is among the prominent speakers about our tragic past. Itbecame a tradition for Harry Rosenblum and I to alternate eachyear as chairman and speaker at those Yizkor services.267The Executive of the Czenstochover Society of Montreal, 1964Seated from left: B.

Camps in Germany and also fromCzenstochova itself. Considering the number of newly arrived inMontreal, the Czenstochover Aid Society decided to call a generalmeeting of all the Landsleit in Montreal in November, 1948.Mr. George Klein, vice president of the Aid Society had suggestedthat the Landsleit survivors of the Holocaust take over the leader-ship of the Czenstochover Society and the founding members be-come the Senior Advisory Consulting Committee who would par-ticipate in all activities of the newly-formed CzenstochoverSociety, including the financial support. At that meeting inNovember 1948, a resolution was accepted to change the nameof the organization to the “Czenstochover Society of Montreal”.In early 1949, the previous executive transferred the sum of 90dollars to the newly elected treasurers of the society, Mr. HarryKlein and Mr. Yecheskel Silver, who continued as president fora few years..The Executive of the Czenstochover Society of MontrealThe “Czenstochover Landsleit of Montreal” elevated itself to veryhigh standards as a result of the activities it initiated in Montreal.It served as a model for other Landsmanshaften and Societiesthrough its positive efforts and undertakings:1. to continue the traditions of the Czenstochover JewishCommunity;2. to perpetuate the memory of the martyrs in the heroic struggleagainst the brutality of Nazi Germany;3. the commitment to organize a yearly Yizkor Service in memoryof the martyrs who perished in the Holocaust;4. to bring to justice the Nazi German murderers who bestiallydestroyed the Jewish population of Czenstochova;5. to give financial aid to our Landsleit overseas, victims of theNazi regime;262CZENSTOCHOV - Our Le^yWillie Yablon (Yablonkiewich)Willie Yablon was bom in Czenstochova to Berish and Chavah (neeFishof). He came to Montreal in 1930 and mai’ried Adela Goldbergof Lodz. They had two sons and a daughter. His family was promi-nent in Czenstochova. They had participated in all social activitiesof that city. He maintained contact with his family until theSecond World War. After the war he too, looked for an opportuni-ty to help the survivors of Czenstochova. The Czenstochover AidSociety of Montreal elected him Chairman. He gave his time andeffort with great devotion. As a member of the Senior AdvisoryCommittee, he was always ready to give generous financialassistance.Bessie and Yecheskel Silver (Zylberberg)In 1929, Bessie Perelman married Yecheskel Silver in Czensto-chova. They came to Montreal in 1931. They had two children,Louis and Boslyn. The Silvers were very active members of theCzenstochover Society.When the Czenstochover Holocaust survivors arrived in Montrealthey were invited to meet with the existing Aid Society.A new group was formed under the name of **CzenstochoverSociety of Montreal”. Yecheskel Silver was elected its Presidentand Treasurer. He has been active in the Society for many yearsand his family’s home was an “open house” for the Society untilhis death on September 12, 1959. During his years as President,intensive work was done to provide financial aid to the manyCzenstochovers overseas. Many meetings of the executive wereheld to organize fund-raising activities. The Society’s campaignswere always very successful. The Silver family were alwayshelpful in the projects of the Czenstochover Society in Montreal.M. Silver (Zilberberg)Motel Silver was born in Czenstochova to Chayim and Mania(Staszevska). The family came to Montreal in 1926 and establish-ed their home.

Later he belonged to the Senior Advisory Committeeof the Society.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy261David GelberDavid Gelber, son of Kasriel and Sarah, was bom in Czenstochovato a nationalistic and orthodox family. This environment influ-enced his entire life. The depression following World War Ibrought misery to the Jewish masses, particularly to Czensto-chova. Hunger and poverty were widespread. David, in his desireto escape the life of poverty, was planning to leave Czenstochova,but he was too young for this venture. Finally, at the age of 17,he left home for Vienna, Austria. He was very impressed with theViennese lifestyle. However, he did not want to remain there. Hisdream was to be a pioneer in Israel, or to be reunited with hisbrother, Nathan, who lived in Canada. After three years in Vienna,he received a visa, through the efforts of his brother, whichenabled him to move to Quebec City, Canada. He learned Englishand French and, also, found himself involved in the social life ofthe Jewish community. He became Treasurer of the TalmudTorah. Five years later, he became a Canadian citizen. In QuebecCity, David met and married Saydie Evan, daughter of Gteorge andJessica Evan. They had three children, two sons and a daughter.When their eldest son, Nachum, became Bar-Mitzvah, the fami-ly moved to Montreal. All three children received a traditionalJewish upbringing and graduated from University asprof es sionals.Mrs. Saydie Gelber was well-known in Montreal and played aprominent social role. (She passed away recently.) David Gelberwas one of the founders of the Czenstochover Aid Society and wasits Treasurer. He made valuable contributions to many culturalcauses and institutions.Avraham MayerowiczAs one of the old-timers in Montreal, Mayerowicz influenced theformation of the “Aid Society” in Montreal. It was at the timewhen the atrocities of Nazi Germany against the Jewish peopleof Europe became known to the world. The Jewish communityof Czenstochova was destroyed — over 35,000 of its membersslaughtered by the Nazis. Czenstochovers living in Montreal wereanxious to help survivors from their hometown, now in D.P.camps. Mayerowicz is known in many institutions of Talmudicstudy in the Montreal Jewish community. The Yeshiva “MaorHagolah” conducted by Rabbi Benjamin Borzykowski, himself asurvivor of the Holocaust, is among those he patronizes.260CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyNathan GelberNathan Gelber was among the first organizers of the Czensto-chover Society of Montreal. He was bom in Czenstochov to Kasrieland Sarah, who raised him in a religious, nationalistic environ-ment.

Hate apparently knows no boundaries. Arepeople’s memories so short? Every year, there are fewer andfewer survivors of the Holocaust. Their unique ability totestify to the horror of World War II disappears with theirpassing. That helps to explain why many children ofHolocaust survivors are now beginning to play anincreasingly significant role in remembering the past in orderto avoid its recurrence. We, the Second Generation, are calledupon to perpetuate and preserve our legacy and pass it to ourchildren, so that they become the link in time.”TorontoAre People’sMemoriesSo Short ?“Questions that survivors expected to hear25 years ago finally began to be asked. Thesecond generation of Holocaust survivors istaking over to perpetuate the memory ofthose who perished in the Holocaust.”“The survivors of Hitler’s “final solution”,however, did not have the luxury ofabstraction. For ordinary survivors, it was an unbelievableordeal they happened to survive.”“Whether silent or outspoken, survivors were torn betweenremembering and forgetting, between shielding their childrenfix)m their unhappy history, and warning them that the worldwas a dangerous place. They urged each other to “forget thegruesome things, and look forward and see the good”, but thespeed with which the Holocaust was receding into historyfrightened them. The Holocaust is a crime that will never beforgotten. It is not to be repeated. Those tales deserve ofeverlasting hatred of the barbarians whom we should neverforget or forgive. We live in the bloodiest century in thehistory of the Jewish people and in the history of mankind.”TorontoTornBetweenRememberingandForgettingCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy199Second Generation ^ Speaking Out!“Tb call something history means that ithas come to an end. Now you can clap it ina book: it is finished.”‘‘The truth we are hem to assert is that theHolocaust did not begin in the 1930s and itdid not begin in the 1940s. You might thinkit began in the Middle Ages, but we wholived in the 20th century, know that theMiddle Ages never ended; they reemerged in the 20thcentury. Now the torture chambers of the Inquisition, mademore horrible by modern science and technology, chemistry,physics, engineering and even medecine, pmduced abarbarism far beyond the limited powers of the Dark Ages.The mind still stumbles over the pinblem; how could thishappen; how could the world let it happen? Reason faltei's;logic is pamlyzed. For us Jews, of course, thri Nazi Holocausthas special significance. This was to be the ‘‘Final Solution”,and that means that we must be prepared to carry the burdenof the survivor, for generations and generations to come.”MontrealBarbarismof ModernSciencefar beyondcruelty ofPast History‘‘It took them more than 30 years before th€)Survivors of the Holocaust could speakopenly of their experiences to a world readyto listen. Now, quite suddenly, it appears thechildren of these survivors are coming ofage. As they do, they are speaking out in avoice of their own. That voice is an intense,sharp one, which gives expression to theirspecial legacy. Until recently, the burden of that legacy wasseldom discussed among survivors and their children.”“Words alone can not convey the shock and horror thataccompanied this tangible evidence of the Nazi regime’ssystematic pmgram of genocide. We must never forget thesecrimes against humanity. We must study and understand therecord of the Holocaust. From this we must learn to remaineternally vigilant against all tyranny and oppression.

Yad Vashem, which maintains an Avenue of the Righteous atthe site of the memorial and museum to honor those who riskedtheir own lives or freedom on behalf of Jewish friends orneighbors, now lists 8,000 Righteous Gentiles who hid or other-wise saved Jews from the Nazis.On a per capita basis, Holland leads in the percentage of Christianswho helped Jews. Yad Vashem lists 3,000 Righteous Gentiles fromHolland. Poland, with a much larger Jewish and non-Jewish popu-lation, also has 3,000.

Eli Zborowski, president of the American andInternational Societies, reported that Yad Vashem’s historic Valleyof the Destroyed Jewish Communities, adjoining the museum andmemorial in Jerusalem, was nearing completion and would be for-mally opened at solemn ceremonies next year. On huge stonepillars in the Valley, covering an area of six acres dug out amongthe hills surrounding Yad Vashem, will be engraved the namesof some 5,000 European communities where Jews once lived.A giX)Lip of elderly Jewish people in fmnt ofthe Old Peoples Home in Czenstochox^CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy197Grandchildren HearSurvivors’ TalesF^x)ni The New York MediaFor many Jews who survived the Nazi Holocaust, telling theirchildren about the suffering they endured proved too emotionala task. But they are finding it easier to speak with their grand-children about their experiences, according to Dr. Yitzhak Arad,chairman of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’Remembmnce Authority in Jerusalem.“Holocaust families have gone through an unusual metamor-phosis,” Arad said during a recent visit to New York. “Many sur-vivors deliberately refrained from discussing their suffering inorder to spare their children — and themselves — the pain ofremembrance. In an effort to build new lives, survivors oftenburied themselves in their business or professional lives, leavinglittle time to dwell on the past.”“Today, with the passage of time and the softening of memory,survivors feel differently. They can never forget, but today moreand more of them can talk about the terrible losses they knew.And they are telling their stories to their grandchildren, who arelearning about the Holocaust in a way that the survivors’ ownchildren never did.”“Moreover,” said Arad, an historian who has spent 20 years ashead of the Yad ’Vashem memorial, “renewed interest in theHolocaust is not confined to the grandchildren of Holocaustfamilies but appears to be worldwide. The 1.2 million visitors toYad Vashem each year includes a growing proportion of young peo-ple from all countries, many of whom are not Jewish.“Germany,” Arad said, “is understandably one of the nations mostinvolved in raising the consciousness of young people to the Nazimurder of Jews.” He explained that the German governmentallows young people to do voluntary work in Israel as an alter-native to military service through an organization called Sunden-Zeichen — “Mark of Sin” — as part of Germany’s effort to repentfor its crimes against the Jewish people.196CZENSTQCHOV - Our LegacyThey began to work hard to build a new family and a life forthemselves in a foreign country. On March 7, 1948, almost a yearafter arriving in the U.S., a baby daughter was born and namedDorothy Esther Gelber. Three years later on July 5, 1951, a babyson and brother for Dorothy was born, Harry Charles Gelber —the beginning of a new family. They followed the same religiouspractices as in Europe, raising their children in the kosher andorthodox tradition. The children attended public schools as wellas Hebrew School. My grandparents brought up their children asAmericans.In October of 1974, Joseph retired and moved with his wife. Rose,to Miami, Florida. They had a car, a new condo, personal belong-ings, and love for each other.On July 1, 1985, Joseph Gelber died. This was four days beforehis son’s birthday and eight months before his 50th Anniversary.He is survive^d by his wife, his brother, his sister, his children andhis only grandson, me.He is buried in Beth David Cemetery, in New York City.

England and Pi*ance agined to become allies of Poland.Soviet Russia arranged a peace treaty to be signed by Polish andGerman delegates. Hitler, of Germany, and Mussolini, of Italy,signed a military treaty joining forces. On August 31, 1939, thetreaty between Stalin and Hitler was ratified in Moscow.Trouble was also brewing in the heart of Czenstochov, the homeof my grandparents. German spies were seen on every streetcorner. My grandparents gathered together with other familymembers, so that they were with one another in case somethingshould happen. On the radio, they heard that German officialswere falsely accusing the Jews of crimes they had never com-mitted. From then on Jews were persecuted all through Europe.Every Jew was forced to wear an arm band with the Star of Davidon it. David decided to give up the name ‘‘David” because, inPoland, it was a very Jewish name. Ever since, he has been onlyknown as Joseph Gelben*. Hitler started to have a desire to cap-ture or even kill every Jew, so he began establishing concentra-tion camps to house and execute the Jews. My grandparents spentmonths trying to hide and avoid the conce^ntration camps, but theywere eventually found. Joseph Gelber was moved from camp tocamp along with his wife;, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers andsons-in-law. He was with his brother Charles for the most part,but was separated from his wife and everyone else. Later on, hewas miraculously liberated by a Jewish-American soldier,Seymour Zipper. Other family members were liberated by othersoldiers of the American or Russian armies.Many fatalities resulted from the war. My grandfather’s brothers,Charles and Abe, were killed in the concentration camps. Hissister, Molly, was also killed, along with their parents, Leon andEsther Rachel. Her three children perished. Aunts, uncles,cousins, in-laws, and close friends perished.All but a few of the liberated survivors immigrated to foreigncountries, such as France, Israel, England, the Netherlands,Czechoslovakia, Canada, Australia, the United States and others.On March 14, 1947, my grandparents arrived in the United States,after being rejected by the Netherlands. They landed in New YorkHarbor because Ellis Island had, already, been shut down. They,along with old friends and close family, settled in the Bronx. Theyhad to go to night school to learn English after a hard day’s work,earning money for the basic needs of the family. Along with fur-niture making, my grandfather took on the trade of designing andmaking picture frames. Some of his frames have been sold tofamous museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of FineArts.194CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyLife of a Holocaust SurvivorBy Steven Sandberg, Age 12On August 13, 1907, David Joseph Gelber, my grandfather-to-be,was born in the small Jewish community of Czenstochova,Poland. He was the oldest son of Leon and Esther Rachel Gelber,who had five other children, three boys and two girls. The nexteldest was his brother Charles, followed by his sister Miriam,another brother Abe, his second sister Molly, and finally his lit-tle brother Philip. His father was a proud and respected furnituremaker. The family was very religious, living by strict orthodoxand kosher rules. They probably considered themselves poor, buttheir love was very great. Each person in the household hadspecific choms and i*esponsibilities. The father was considered thehead of the home and family, responsible for everyone.As David became more responsible for his actions, he chose hisown friends and started to date girls around his age. One of thegirls he met and dated was Rose Czarny, my grandmother-to-be.Although she was a year younger than David, they had a lot incommon and enjoyed each other’s company. On March 15, 1936,they were finally married. They had three children, two boys andone girl. David, like his father, was a furniture maker. He was verytalented in many fields, but most of all, his art. His hobby waspainting and drawing. David never sold his paintings because ofhis modesty. He thought, “Well, it’s just something I like to doin my spare time’’. So, he gave them as gifts or mementos tofriends and family. In their home, like the one they grew up in,they spoke Yiddish, along with their native language, Polish. Mostwomen were not allowed to learn Hebrew because it was againstorthodox laws; Yiddish was taught instead. As World War II wasappreaching, Jews were starting to be considered inferior orsecond class.In March, 1938, the German Army, under the leaderehip of AdolfHitler, took over the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia. World War IIbegan on September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland, thehomeland of my grandparents. Hitler wanted to control Danzig,CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy193feel is a strong sense that life is precious and there will alwaysbe good times and bad times. The trick is to have faith that thebad times will not last forever and look for the moments of loveand humour that will occur; even in a holocaust.I also feel a strong drive to live my life in a way that is unselfishand has significance for others. I believe that fate and not justluck made my parents survive among the very few and that theyare here for a special reason; and that I am too.It has been my personal challenge, to raise my own children tobe sensitive and responsible to the needs of others and alwaysappreciative of what they have. I hope they can remember thestrength and courage of their ancestors and pass on the story ofsurvival to their children.I have not as yet realized the total impact my family’s past hashad on my life. However, as I get older and deal with more of life’sstruggles, I feel that somewhere inside me is a voice, telling methat I will land on my feet. My parents did and so can I.192CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe 2nd GenerationBy Lynn GoodmanI am the child of survivors of the Holocaust. Until recently, thatin itself had no special meaning to me.I heard other “children” discussing the feelings of guilt andsadness they lived with, but I could not identify with them. Iassumed quite simply, that 1 was different.Now, as I find myself in a very difficult and stressful time, I realizethat being the child of survivors has had a significant impact onmy life^.My parents, Jack Swietarski and Frania Windman, were born inPoland and came to Canada in 1947 at the ages of twenty-nineand twenty-seven respectively. They were fortunate in havingfamily members survive with them. Of the thirteen children inmy mother’s family, eight survived and most settled in or nearTbi*onto. My father had relatives in Canada who had come beforethe war and his only surviving sister settled in Israel.The focus of my nuclear family was never centered on ourselves.This seemed very different to me from my Canadian friends. Wewere deeply involved in and cared about all of our extended fami-ly and friends. The bonds I formed during those years remainstmng today.Jewish holidays were celebmted at large dinners and while we didnot attend synagogue or practice all religious customs, I diddevelop a strong sense of my Jewish heritage from my family’stogetherness. Thei*e was always story telling and laughter andalthough we heard many tales about the “old country” and thewar, they were never told with hate or bitterness. Somehow myrelatives could see life beyond the atrocities and even managedto find some humour in very tmgic cireumstances — like the timemy mother was given oxen and a cart to tmvel with on her own.Her story could have focused on the terrer of being alone and run-ning for her life. Instead, her story was told laughing at herself,as she tried to manage animals she knew nothing about!I am sure that my family’s positive attitude is the reason I do notfeel the guilt many of my contempomries do. Instead, what I doCZENFSTOCHOV — Our Le^&cy191Thoughts and Feelings of Second andThird Generation Holocaust SurvivorsWe were brought up in a home where the Czenstochover Lands-manschaft was at the centre of all our activities. Our father andmother, Berel and Sala Ickowicz, took the^ concerns foi* the "lands-leit” very much to heart. From them, we learned that workingfor and with the Landsmanschaft meant helping, sharing andfriendship.As far back as we can lemember, our de^ar father, who died on June15, 1988, was chairman of this vibrant society. He stronglybelieved that fundraising was everyone’s job. He had all of usactively involved in selling tickets for different fundraising pro-jects. It also seems like just yesterday that our father and ourmother both worked aggi^ssively in setting up Passovei* packagesto be sent to needy families, both in Poland and in Israel. Theyworked relentlessly for this cause.Our door was always open to the Landsmanschaft. These charac-teristics and values they gave us will live within us forevei* andhave been handed down to theii* five granddaughters.Gloria Bi umerPaulette Ke^stelmanI AM THE GRANDCHILD OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. My name isJennifer Deborah Brumer. Both of my Hebrew names oncebelonged to other young women like me. These two women, mygreat aunts, were in their late twenties and married. Deborah hada young son. They and their families died in the concentrationcamps. I remember these women I never knew with sadness andrespect. I also remember their brothers and sisters and parentswho perished and I think about all the aunts and uncles andcousins I will never have.Within these thoughts of those who died, I celebrate the braveryand courage of my grandparents who lived. I realize that withouttheir strength and perseverance, the Nazi plan would have suc-ceeded, and I would not be here to write about what I think,remember, realize and celebrate.So, I have a hope, a prayer, a dream for you: A dream that neveragain will having different beliefs or different heritage becomea death warrant for the innocent. Never again, anywhere, anytime,for any reason, will people experience such evil. And never againwill people die as a result of ignorance and fear.Jennifer Brumer190CZENSTOCHOV - Our LesroQTAt times I found it surprising that my mother could watch moviesabout the war and would want Dad to watch them too. It seemedas if they confirmed to her in a very concrete way that somehow,miraculously, she and my father had survived these war atrocities.I was always impressed with their incredible will to surmountobstacles, despite their horrible experiences in the Holocaust andtheir struggles and success in adjusting to their new country,Canada. Their marvelous zest for and capacity to enjoy life, theircontinued respect for humanity, their tolerance of other peoples’ethnic differences, and their love for and commitment to familyand friends made my parents’ house a warm and vibrant place.Most of all, I am left with memories of two wonderful people whotaught me a lot about survial, about life, about “Menschlichkeit”and how they represented a whole generation of survivors whowere as incredible as they were! Mom’s amazing optimism andsense of humour in good times and in bad and Dad’s tenacity andfeisty approach to life have left a lasting impression on me.I can also honestly say that they made me proud to be their childand a Jew — despite Hitler’s maniacal design to destroy us all!Special PeopleI never really knew my Bubby Gittel but I know my Zaide Sam.I have heard a lot about the Holocaust and I think it's great thatsome people lived through this horrible thing and I think that thepeople who lived through it are very special people.Carrie SolomonAge 11Granddaughter of Samuel Kartusand the late Gita KartusCZENSTQCHOV - Our Legacy189At a much later point in time Dad again met this Jewish Capo whowas now an inmate at Theresienstadt. The Capo was close to dy-ing from an illness. He begged Dad for forgiveness for the injus-tice and pain he had caused Dad. Dad forgave him.I am still in awe of my father’s tremendous courage and theconsequences he had suffered, risking his life to rescue mymother.I remember Dad telling me about his suffering at a war factoryin Colditz towards the end of the war.He had been stabbed in the lower back, with a bayonet, by adrunken Oberscharfuhrer. Dad was seriously wounded and sent tothe “Lazaret” (military hospital) where he remained for ten days.Some Jewish doctors there urged Dad and other recovering pa-tients, to muster all the strength they had and march hundredsof kilometres to their final destination.Eight kilometres away from Terezin, Dad collapsed, succumbingto total exhaustion. A German officer threatened to shoot him ifhe didn’t get up. Dad vividly recalls those moments when his lifehung in the balance because he could no longer go on. Insteadthe officer saved Dad’s life by throwing him onto a wagon of haywhich took Dad to Terezin, where he was finally liberated duringPassover 1945.My parents always made me feel as if I had known their parents(my late grandparents) personally. They told me anecdotes abouttheir personalities and stories about their lives. They truly mademy grandparents and their own childhood come alive for me.On one occasion, when Mom and I had one of our cozy eveningchats over a cup of tea, she told me about the time when theGermans were invading the ghetto and were taking many of theolder people away to Treblinka to be gassed. She described howher mother, a wise and clever woman, tried to reassure her andcalmly reminded her to look after her younger sister and brother,because she knew she would never see any of them again. In themeantime, my grandfather ran frantically around the roof of theirapartment building, crying that he so much wanted to live.I remember sobbing about the vision of my poor maternal grand-father — who, in his pictures resembled a cuddly teddy bear - run-ning about helplessly, begging for his life and also about mymother’s terrible desperation about failed efforts to get herparents out of the ghetto to safety.I was always astonished at how my parents had come through thewar at all, but even more so, at how they had used their wits inso many difficult and dangerous situations.188CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyMemories Of My Parents* ExperiencesBy Evelyn Kartus Solomon*From the time when I was still quite young, I remember myparents having animated discussions with other survivors aboutwhat it had been like in the Czenstochover ghettos and in thecamps. They talked about their experiences and about who hadsurvived and who hadn’t. Amidst many a tragic tale there wereoften bursts of laughter and episodes of unbelievable acts ofheroism and courage. When they shared this horrible time in theirlives with each other and their friends, it was generally with thosewho had also been through it and really understood.My mother was always more open about her experiences than myfather. Perhaps this was because hers were somewhat less trau-matic than his. She was in “Hasag”, in camps and in “Selections”.But Dad was in these too and also in a number of concentrationcamps where he came daily face to face with death.It was always more painful for Dad to talk about what he had beenthrough. I have never felt comfortable pressing him for informa-tion, but I always wanted to know more, so that I could be sureto pass on this legacy of our heritage to my children.In particular, I remember both my parents telling me about anincident that happened in “Hasag”.My mother and father were working the night shift in this workcamp when Mom was being verbally insulted and beaten by a“Capo” (camp police) for smoking a cigarette at one of the ma-chines. My father tried to rescue my mother from this abusiveman and defended her by punching him back. The Capo was alsoa Jew who took advantage of his position and the power he hadover his fellow Jewish captives.In retaliation the Capo reported Dad to the German authoritieswho dragged him out of his bunk in the middle of the night andgave him 25 lashes, beating him almost senseless.♦ Evelyn Kartus Solomon is the daughter of Stashek (Sam) Kartus and the lateGutka (Gita) Kartus.CZENSTCX]!HOV — Our Leffocy187A meaningful argument against inter-marriage is this legacy weare obligated to perpetuate. We must not only remember for our-selves, but we must continue to tell and retell future generationsthat the Holocaust was not a fictitious horror, as some will haveus believe, but the reality of what happened to our ancestors. Wewere the tragic scapegoats for a generation’s fears and weak-nesses. Tb allow our children and the world to forget this, wouldbe to diminish not only the horrors suffered by our parents, butalso the memories of those who paid with their lives.My husband’s parents are also Holocaust survivors. Despite theemotional and physical horrors our parents endured, they turnedadversity into success by leading exemplary lives. Both sets ofparents have enjoyed (to this point) forty-six years of marriage.They have experienced life’s trials and tribulations together with-out the loving guidance of their own parents or the support of anextended family. Despite this, they have raised their children tohave a true appreciation of family and traditions, and to enjoy loveof freedom and dignity.Our love, admiration and respect for our parents know no bounds.Their love and strength have allowed them not only to endurethemselves, but also to enrich a part of mankind through theirexistence.Czenstochover in the United States at a Yizkor Memorial Servicein 1954.186CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leg^iyA Voice from theSecond GenerationBy Roslyn Gail KeriMy name is Roslyn Gail Keri. I am the daughter of Hyman(Chaim) Fishman and Bess Fishman (nee Glatt). My father, pater-nal grandfather and great-grandfather were all born in Czensto-chova. As my father has recounted to my brother and me, his wasa large family, comprised of a sister, two brothers, many auntsand uncles, and a score of cousins. Sadly, my father and three ofhis cousins were the only survivors.My grandfather was a man whose life was centered around Torah,Veavodah. He belonged to an Hassidic Shtibel and a religiousZionist Organization (Mizrachi); his family led a rich, cultured life.My mother’s family lived in Warsaw and was very religious. Mymother and her sister survived because their parents managedto send them out of Warsaw to a small town, where they hadfamily. From there, they were taken to a labour camp.Unlike other families who did not experience the Holocaust, mybrother and I grew up with little sense of family history. Ourfamily was grounded in the here and now. There was always a pro-found sadness in the fact that most of our extended family wasmissing. We were unable to enjoy the close bonds that many ofour peers formed with their grandparents. We never knew mostof our aunts, uncles and cousins.We had no sense of who our parents were as children or how theyevolved into the adults they had become, as they were our mainsources of information. Although they would sporadically recalltheir childhood memories of family and holidays, these memorieswere bittersweet; for many of them were of siblings who neverreached adulthood.As second generation Holocaust survivors, we have learned notto take family and loved ones for granted. There is joy (in that weare perpetuating their memories) and yet a distinct sa^ess, whennaming our children for those loved ones whose lives were sotragically ended.CZENSTOCHOV — Out Legsicy185small! They hardly had any food, but a kind Christian familyoccasionally brought them food; but they had to be very carefulthat they wouldn’t get caught by the Germans. They lived in theattic for a while. One day, a German came in and found out wherethey were hiding, and took each of them to different concentra-tion camps.In 1945, Anne and Margot both died of typhus fever.

This wasonly because Adolf Hitler decided to hate all of the Jews and com-manded that they all be executed. I find it very hard to believe thathuman beings can be so cruel with one another.

Anne’s life used to be perfect! Shewas born on June 12th, in the year 1929, in Germany The Frankswere very rich. She had a very smart sister named Margot andtwo caring parents, Edith and Otto Frank, who always wantedtheir children to be happy.When Edith and Otto found out that Adolf Hitler was now theleader of Germany and wanted all of the Jews (such as them) tobe killed, Edith and Otto moved to Holland. They hoped that nowthey would be safe. Anne and Margot were in excellent schools.Anne was very popular; she had many friends and boyfriends!Anne was also very smart. They lived in peace for quite a while.Soon it was Anne’s 13th birthday She got many great presents,although she especially loved the notebook that she had gotten,and decided to use it as a diary.The Franks were very upset when they heard that Hitler nowinvaded Holland too ! Hitler made many restrictions for the Jewishpeople. They had to wear a yellow star badge everywhere they wentthat said “Jew” on it. The Jewish people all had to be indoors by8:00 p.m. They were not allowed to take public transportation ordrive cal's or ride bikes! Soon the Jews were all being capturedand taken away to different concentration camps.The Franks were not caught immediately. Early one morning,they left their home behind forever and went to hide in the atticof an old building. They celebrated Shabbat and other holidays.It was very hard to do so, because they always had to be quiet sothat no one would find them.

Child of the Holocaust is JackKuper’s autobiography It tells of how he disguised himself as aCatholic orphan in order to stay alive.Wasn’t Jack afraid without his parents? Where would he go nowthat he was alone? What if it was found out that he was Jewish— what would happen to him? These were some of the questionscontinuously on my mind as I read this book. It made me verysad to think that Jack was no longer with his parents and brotherand would probably never see them again.Though Jack Kuper survived his adventures, he leaves readersbreathless, wondering what this brave and creative boy will donext.I would recommend this book to others my age as it would givethem, as it gave me, a good understanding of what children andadults lived through during the Holocaust. I find it hard to believethat it is a true story.This book is very well written and not too difficult to follow. Ittouches every emotion: I felt sad, happy, angry and excited at dif-ferent times throughout the book.If ever a film version of this book was made, I would definitelygo to see it, although it would likely be painful to view.182CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyWe Must LearnMore About the HolocaustBy Lauren Klein TatnerI CANNOT BE MORE THANKFUL that my Bubby Eva and my ZaidyHarry survived the War. The reasons are many, but most of all,without them, all those people in my family, including myself,would not be here today I find that a very troubling thought.My grandparents and the millions of Jewish children and adultswere all innocent people! I still cannot understand why anyonewould want to harm or even kill them! I find that thought verydisturbing!Whenever I have the opportunity, I choose to read books aboutthe Holocaust, to learn more about what the Jewish people wentthrough in the past. Usually it is very difficult for me to getthrough those books. I find it very upsetting just to think aboutall that they suffered. Child of the Holocaust by Jack Kuper andthe Diary of Anne Frank are two books which I read, both of whichdeal with the stories of children my age.I am very pleased that my Zaidy wrote the book “Czenstochov -Our Legacy”, as it is his generation that can best recount whathappened during the Holocaust. Many actually lived through thathorrible nightmare!When there will be no more of his generation, the people of thefollowing generations will appreciate reading this book. If every-one reads and realizes that something this tragic has happenedin the past, we can all work together to ensure that this will neverhappen again!CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy181Beyond a Single Word or ThoughtBy Janet Klein SlavinWhen I think about my parents and the Holocaust, not a singlewoixl comes to mind, not a single thought. A large lump in themiddle of my throat will not allow me to ever visualize a singlemoment of time my parents must have suffered during thatterrible period in their lives.When I think about my parents, I see them now, as the caring,loving and proud parents who are always and have always beenthere for us, their special children. We, their children, who arespecial because they survived and were able to give life to us. Weare special because they survived and we then were blessed tohave them as our parents.In my growing years, my parents never for a moment burdenedus with stories of the many years they had suffered. Yet we alwaysknew. In fact, they even tried to shield us from any hardships oftheir more recent years.Because of my parents, who have been there to protect, to teachand to love, I aspire to do as wonderful a job with my children.I love them very much.These few^ words and the ability to express them in writing havebeen inspired by my beautiful niece, Lauren, who hasdemonstrated her courage and sensitivity in expressing heremotions on paper. Thank you sweetie!180CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyIn light of their tragic past and incomprehensible losses, I havemarvelled at their continued ability to overcome life’s hardships,stoically endure life’s difficulties and maintain and project apositive and healthy outlook on life.As a child of Holocaust survivors, I cannot say that my growing-up years were filled with horrid stories of my parents’ tragic past.Any stories recounted, grew out of questions I posed to try tounderstand all that they had been through. Their comfort levelin sharing these stories only grew as I grew older.I know that I can never understand all that they had lived throughduring that hideous period in Jewish history. They, too, know thatI can never really understand all that they had experienced. WhatI can understand, is the importance, to them, of the strong senseof identity they have given to me, which has allowed me to feelthat strong sense of family and my roots, which I hope will con-tinue to be passed on through the generations.I am very proud of my father’s efforts and tremendous displayof strength, perserverence and dedication as he relentlesslyworked to compile this English language book on his hometown,Czenstochov. I admire my mother’s patience and support to himas he clocked 7-day weeks, during these, their retirement years,in preparation of this book.This book is a compilation of historical material, memoirs,memorials and photographs pertinent to Czenstochov and itsinhabitants who. Like my parents, lived through the Holocaust andbegan anew in North America. I believe in the value of this book,which will serve as memories of the families, such as my own,who struggled to rebuild their lives, and will serve as the photoalbum to families, such as my own, who search for the links withtheir past.Malka and Yitzhak Borensteinin the ghetto in 1940Yosel Borenstein,1939CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy179A Strong Senseof Family and RootsBy Ruth Klein TatnerFamily and Photographs — two terms that evoke so muchemotion and hold so much meaning for me.

Despite theirtragic past and incomprehensible losses, they were strong and lov-ing in their role as parents and friends to me and my sisters.Despite the linguistic, cultural and generational gap, they werestrong as role models.I would often smile (albeit with a certain child like skepticism,for nobody could have been such perfect children all the time) asthey searched the photographs of their minds and shared withme and my sisters anecdotes of their own childhood, as lessonsin family respect and caring. These vividly-described anecdotescame to serve as my photo album of their past, my roots.178CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegracyReflectionsBy Marilyn Klein KobricThe definition of the word “survivor” is to continue to live, toexist.Against all odds my parents, Eva and Harry, “survived” theunspeakable horrors of the Holocaust. After their liberation theymet, married and immigrated to Canada. They did not know thelanguage or customs of their adopted home but found thestrength, determination and courage to rebuild their lives.I often listened to my parents discuss the past but I found myselfdisassociated from their words. I could not even for one momentimagine my own mother and father living through the horrorsthey described. It was less painful for me to watch movies or readbooks about the lives of strangers.I remember looking at photographs of my grandparents. As theylooked back at me I wondered what it would be like to have myown grandparents who would love me and make me feel special.I am named in loving memory of my grandmothers Rivka andMalka and they continue to live through me.I have tremendous gratitude, respect and love for my parents.They have given me an appreciation for life. I am their child — achild of “survivors”. I continue to draw on their endless supplyof love and courage. This will remain with me for all of my life.I hope to pass this on to their grandchildren.V THREEGENERATIONSTestUy...The Czenstochover JewishCommunity was uprooted. Butwe — the survivors — startednew lives. We have pledged tomake sure that our childrenand grandchildren will knowand remember where theirroots are. They must know thattheir ancestors suffered anddied, only because they wereJews.It is because of us that Hitler’s“final solution” has failed. Wemade a new beginning towardsa Jewish future in dignity.176CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyHis wife contradicts him. “WTien you come back after 45 years, andyou speak Polish, for sure you were Jewish.”They walked through the houses where they had been reai'ed, nowoccupied by Poles, who the Peldbrills say were very hospitable butdidn’t ask many questions.‘T wanted to be where my parents were born,” she says, ‘‘to be in thatplace once before I die.”We Cannot Go Backto Where Our Parents Grew UpBy William Zimmerman Second GenerationAs A MEMBER OF THE SECOND GENERATION, I view the concentrationcamp as the central theme in my life. It is, for me, the reference pointagainst which all else is measured. We have a common bond with ourparents, the first generation. We, too, are survivors. We share theguilt, mourn the past and think about what might have been.No, we were not there. We were not even born yet. However, the pictureis so vivid in our minds. How many times have we pictured thetransports, felt the fear, smelled the horrors ?How could we have faredunder those conditions ? Do we really understand what it means tosuffer to the extent that our parents did? These and other questionsconstantly weigh on our minds.Yet there is a part of the suffering that is uniquely ours. We are thegeneration who never had an extended family. We have no grand-parents, aunts, uncles, cousins. We cannot go back to where ourparents grew up, to the schools they attended, to the friends andneighbors that remember them as young children. This is part of ourlegacy. We have very little in terms of a tangible past. It is mostlyour parents’ recollections and a few photographs.So how are we to compensate for the deprivations that resulted fromthe camps? No, we will never take away the bitterness of the masskillings. We do not and cannot make up for the lives that were lost.Yet, we are living proof of the spirit and determination of the firstgeneration. They, the true heroes who reconstructed what they couldof their lives and built upon that foundation, have done the best thatthey could.As survivors, both first and second generation have ongoing respon-sibilities, some shared and others unique to each group. Both groupsmust strive to preserve the truth of the past, to assure that those whoperished did not do so in vain and to pass this spirit on to third, fourthand future generations. In essence, then, both first and secondgeneration have a common past and a common future. What aboutthe present ? Here we have two groups that come from totally dif-ferent worlds. Their bond is, of course, the concentration camp. Canfirst generation ever really appreciate the problems and concerns oftheir children when compared to those of their past? Can secondgeneration ever really comprehend all that their legacy implies?These are difficult questions, perhaps never to be answered to thefullest extent. So, we go on, both groups striving to ease their respec-tive paths through life through mutual support, understanding andlove.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy175They walked through the streets of Czenstochova, where Mila hadbeen a schoolgirl and Mendel a teenage tool and dye maker beforethe war.She recalls one day in the ghetto where they were forced to liveduring the war. She had been excused from work by her foreman,and everyone who was not working was called by the Nazis to lineup.Ten people were discovered. “The Nazis found and shot them. Inever forgot this. They were just lying there in the street. It washorrible.’ ’The Feldbrills had to leave the ghetto in 1942 and go to work inRakow, a munitions factory just outside town, until Czenstochovawas liberated in 1945.“It was a place where people were forced to work until all theirstrength was drained. Then they were shipped off to Auschwitzto die.”That was where they met. “We fell in love there — what a laugh,”says Mila.The day before the Germans retreated from the advancing Sovietarmy and deserted Czenstochova, Mendel was sent to Buchen-wald. He survived because his skills were of use to the Nazis. Heescaped two days before the Russians came in.He returned to Czenstochova and found Mila.They first moved to Germany and lived in the apartments offormer Nazis. When they got the chance in 1948, they sailed forHaifa and lived there until 1956, when they moved to San Fran-cisco to be with their sons. They have lived in Millbrae for 17 years.During the interview, they stare at photographs and reflect on thepast.“We’re glad we can tell these stories for people,” Mendel says. “Wewant other [survivors] to know it’s safe, they can go back.”The Feldbrills found Rakow, the work camp, now is a workingmachinery factory. The couple walked into the building wherethey were held captive and talked with the employees.“I’m not angry at them,” Mendel says of the employees there.“Now I am a free person. I can walk in and go out” of the factory.The site of the ghetto is now a bus depot. “1 said to a woman there,‘this is something new here,’ ” Mendel Feldbrill recalls. “ ‘Oh, shesaid, ‘you see, this was a smeUy little ghetto. The Jews were here.’ ”That was their only encounter with anti-Semitism. “We didn’twant to argue with people and many people didn t recognize usas Jews,” he says.174CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacySan Francisco Couple Returns toSite of Painful Holocaust MemoriesBy Garth WolkoffStaff writer of the San Fi'ancisco Jewish BulletinMila Feldbrill returned to the past hoping to find someonewho had survived the Nazi decimation of her native Poland - afriend from high school, a cousin, a neighbor.She found no one.“We were looking for anyone alive,” she says of the people sheknew before the war in Czenstochova, where she was born andlater imprisoned. “It’s hard to believe that everyone is dead.”Her husband Mendel, also born in Czenstochova, returned there45 years after the war to “take a few pictures and to talk topeople.” He walked the streets of his hometown over and overagain “to find peace.”But his wife interrupts with the refrain, “There is no one left.”In an interview, he describes their summer tour of Polish concen-tration camps as a trip “we needed to make” to finally put thehorror behind them.The man sighs, then looks out a window. Mournful resignationshows on his face. “I don’t feel anger anymore,” he says.Several days after the interview,, he calls the Bulletin to say hehas, in fact, found peace — embodied in his two grown sons, Leonand William Feldbrill. “They are our restitution,” he says, “for allthat we went through.”During three weeks in July and August, the Feldbrills engagedin an emotional archaeological dig through the ruins of theirchildhoods and the traces of a nearly extinct Polish Jewry;through Treblinka, where their parents died, through the WarsawGhetto, through Auschwitz.“I was searching for something there in my own town,” he says.“I was looking, I don’t know, maybe for my mother,” he says witha laugh, “but I didn’t see her.”CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy173Here is the text that my family reads at the seder, as reprintedfrom the Jewish Spectator, April 1950:“Perform this ritual after the third of the Four Ceremonial Cups,just before the door is opened for the symbolic entrance of theProphet Elijah. All rise, and the leader of the seder recites thefollowing:“On the night of the seder we remember with reverence and lovethe six million of our people of the European exile who perishedat the hands of a tyrant more wicked than the Pharaoh whoenslaved our fathers in Egypt.“Come, said he to his minions, let us cut them off from being apeople, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more. Andthey slew the blameless and pure, men and women and little ones,with vapors of poison and burned them with fire.“But we abstain from dwelling on the deeds of the evil ones lestwe defame the image of G—d in which man was created.“Now, the remnants of our people who were left in the ghettosand camps of annihilation rose up against the wicked ones fromthe santification of the Name, and slew many of them before theydied.“On the first day of Passover the remnants of the Ghetto ofWarsaw rose up against the adversary, even as in the days ofJudah the Maccabee. They were lovely and pleasant in their lives,and in their death they were not divided, and they broughtredemption to the name of Israel through all the world.“And from the depths of their affliction the martyrs lifted theirvoices in a song of faith in the coming of the Messiah, whenjustice and brotherhood will reign among men.”All sing “Ani Ma’amin” (I Believe), the song of the martyrs in theghettos and liquidation camps:“I believe in perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah:“An though he tarry, nonetheless do I believe.”172CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyWliy on the seder night ? In part, because it was on the fii-st nightof Passover 50 years ago, when the Germans had surmunded theWarsaw Ghetto and were preparing to destroy it, that the lastremnants of the half-million Jews of Wai'saw rose up against theiroppressors and fought one of the most valiant battles of JewishhistoryThe other reason for choosing the seder is that we are command-ed on Passover to tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt, overand over again. “And the more one tells the story of the Exodusfrom Egypt, the greater one’s merit,” the Hagadali says.And so we are commanded from the depths of Auschwitz, by thosewho did not survive to tell the story of European Jewry, over andover again.We who survived consider the recounting of the tale to be thefulfillment of a solemn oath made to those who were killed. “Pro-mise us you will remember,” they said. “Promise us you will tell.”And so, on a holiday when we are gathered with friends and familyto celebrate our freedom, we tell. We tell not only of the destruc-tion, but also of that which was destroyed.There was, we tell, a great Jewish people in Europe for more than1,000 years. They formed thousands of communities; they builttrade and commerce and erected houses of learning and woi'ship.They created their own language, their own literature, their owntheater, their own music. They spewed forth into the world someof the greatest geniuses of the last centuries.And then we must tell of the destruction of the methodicaldehumanization of the Jews first in ghettos and then in concen-tration camps, of the torture and the starvation, of the carefullyorchestrated murder of millions.We tell Nahum Rembo’s story, of children being led to their deathsin Treblinka, and in that we tell the the end of a civilization.And then, after we have recited all this, we can tell of the youngheroes who rose up on the first seder night in 1943, who lashedout against these murderers of children and gave expression tothe bitter outcry of a people in their darkest hour.The struggle of a small and virtually unarmed group of youngJews, led by the likes of 24-year-old Mordechai Anilevitch and28-year-old Tzivia Lubetkin, was the first uprising in occupiedEurope and lasted longer than the German invasion of Poland.We must continue to give life to these unlived lives and somemeaning to their horrible deaths.On the seder night, let us tell their stories and give voice to theircries.CZENSTOCHOV — Our Legacy171loomed so large in my life. For if, after all Czenstochova goes on,sublimely indifferent now to what happened to my parents, andmy whole people, how can I go on endlessly grieving about whatoccurred there? It is now impossible to mythologize Czenstochova.And so life must go on, for people like me — but elsewhere. InCanada, maybe, or Israel, or who knows where. But Poland is nolonger a ‘romanticized’ (if such, be the appropriate word) part ofmy life.”Passover Remembranceof the Warsaw Ghetto, 1943By Zvi HosenweinJewish Telegraphic AgencyNew York — “It was a day that brought me down completely,”recalls Nahum Rembo, secretary of the Warsaw community, in hismemoirs.It was a hot day in August, 1942 and Rembo had been told thatthe Germans were evacuating schools and orphanages, includingthe one run by Janusz Korczak.The Germans began loading the trains that would take thechildren to Treblinka. “The death march started by Korczak withhis children — that, I will never forget,” wrote Rembo.“That was not a march to death, it was a silent organized protestagainst the savagery.“It was surreal. The children were lined up in groups of four, withKorczak leading them, his eyes lifted skywaixl, his hands holdingthose of two children.“At night, I thought I heard the marching of the little children.They are marching to the tune of the teachers. I heard therr marchwithout stop, going in an unknown direction.”^Every year in our home, we pause in the middle of the Passoverseder to retell Nahum Rembo‘s story — and the many other stories,including my own, that made up the destruction of EuropeanJewry.We pause at the passage in the Hagadah that says, “In everygeneration, every individual must feel as if he (or she) personallyhad come out of Egypt.”My modern-day Egypt was WWII Poland, and not a day goes bywithout my thinking of my enslavement them. On the seder night,I ask my family, and all Jews, to think back with me.1 Emaiiuel Ringelblum. Notes fix)in the Ghetto. Vol. 2. pp. 213-214. ti-aiislated fromthe Yiddish, LL. Peretz Publishing. Ismel. 1985.170CZENSTOCHQV - Our LegacyAfter years of neglect, a thick forest had envelopped all but about30 of perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 tombstones. As night was fallingquickly, they headed back to the hotel.The receptionist had good news: a Jewish resident of Czensto-chova who thought he knew Srebrnik’s parents wanted to seethem tomorrow in the lobby.Moshe F. was a robust, 78-year-old pensioner, one of approximate-ly 150-200 Jews still left in Czenstochova. On the eve of the war,28,500 Jews, or one-quarter of the total population, made theirhomes he^re. Most of the Jews were deported to death camps; alucky few, including Srebrnik’s parents, worked at HASAG, theGerman arms factory at the edge of town.Moshe survived the war by fleeing to the Soviet Union; his wife,who remained be3hind, died. After the war, Moshe remarried, andnow, he told the visitors, he lived in a flat in the old ghetto areawith his second wife and 24-year-old daughter.He said that he had indeed known the Srebrnik family, and addedthat he would be pleased to show Henry where Moshe and Abbawei'e buried. The burial site on Kawia Street was not far from hisown house. It was a small field marked by an unobtrusive granitestone memorializing 4,000 Jews — including Moshe and Abba —shot by the Gei*mans.Moshe F. accompanied Srebrnik to the cemetery, and led him tothe weathered, mossy headstone of his mother’s grandfather.Smbiiiik, normally a voluble pemon, was so awed by the sight thathe was unable to talk for many minutes. When he got into the car,he had to fight back the tears.Latei; back at the Hotel Centralny, his composure intact again,he spoke animatedly of what he had seen in Czenstochova.“It’s like catching up with your past,’’ he said of the visit to hisancestral roots. “You’ve known the place but you’ve never seenit. It’s like having been blind all these years and then, miracu-lously, regaining your vision and seeing the world you once knewonly in your mind.“The oddest thing about being in the town was that I simulta-neously felt myself to be a complete stranger, a phantom outsider,almost an intruder from the past, yet at the same time I had avery intense feeling of belonging there. The feeling was anabstmct, metaphysical one — as though I shared some sort of pri-vate communication with the town itself, mther than its actualliving physical inhabitants of today“Seeing the actual hustle and bustle, the cars on the street, theongoing day-to-day life of a city, in a sense made me sign my ownpi iv^ate peace treaty with that part of my past that has alwaysCZENSTQCHOV - Our Legacy169He got to Czenstochova, 125 miles southwest of Wai'saw, at duskand checked into the Hotel Centmlny on Swiei'szewskiego Sti*eet.In a way, the hotel seemed like a second home, for his parentsknew it well in their youth.Srebrnik unpacked, then consulted the black notebook in whichhe had written explicit instructions on how to find the apartmentflats in which his parents, Edward and Esther, once lived. Thoughthey were unable to tell him whether Czenstochova’s Jewishcemetery was still standing, or whether the unmarked graves ofhis mother’s brothers were located in the city rather than thesuburbs. Srebrnik told his friend that he was determined to findboth sites.He had no trouble finding the various crumbling apartmentbuildings where his parents lived before and after the war. Andhe also found the flat where he was born on July 19, 1945. ButSrebrnik had no luck in finding the cemetery, nor in locating thegraves of Moshe and Abba, his late uncles.One late afternoon, 24 hours before he was due to leave Czen-stochova, he happened to glance at a large city map thumb-tackedon the wall opposite the Hotel Centralny receptionist. By sheerchance, his eye caught the Jewish cemetery. (City maps he hadearlier consulted did not show the cemetery.)This sudden discovery excited him so much that he asked thereceptionist if she knew anything about the existence of anorganized Jewish community in Czenstochova. She promised tomake inquiries. Meanwhile, Srebrnik and his friend decided togo to the cemetery.They drove past the old town square and Warszawska Street,where his parents lived before the ghetto was liquidated by theGermans; past the former Jewish hospital on Mirovska Street andup Zlota, a narrow, cobble-stoned country road, on either side ofwhich were small frame houses and gardens.When they reached the end of the road, they asked a passing boywhere the cemetery was. “There’s a cemetery there, but it’s onlya Jewish one,” he said. Abiding by the boy s directions, they wentup a wooded path, but were unable to find a cemetery. Theyreturned to the parked Renault, and a girl gave them differentdirections.They retraced their path, crossed a short bridge, walked along along gray wall affixed with rusty barbed wire, squeezed under twolow-slung pipelines, traversed a railroad track and came to a quietforest glade. It was already growing dark, but they could makeout the ruined remains of an arched gate, which led to an eerie,forlorn Jewish cemetery.168CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyExploring Ancestral Rootsin CzenstochovaBy Sheldon KirshnerReprinted from The Canadian Jewish News of September 30, 1977Czenstochova, Poland — Henry Sreb-rnik was in Czenstochova, the source ofhis familial roots, and he could hardlybelieve it.Even as he walked along Czensto-chova’s main street, Najswictzet MariiPanny, which leads to the Jasna Gora,one of Roman Catholicism’s majorshrines, he felt like a somnambulist inan extremely vivid dream.A 32-year-old native of Czenstochovahad good reason to be amazed that hewas finally here. “My parents and myforefathers were born and raised in thiscity. Through stories — good and bad —it has always been part of me,’’ explained the lecturer in politicalscience and Jewish studies. “I wanted to see it for myself.”Srebrnik arrived in Poland in July, following visits to Germany,Austria and Czechoslovakia. He and his friend, whose parents hailfrom Lodz, another Polish city, crossed into Poland at Szczecin.Fbr Srebrnik, Szczecin was not just an obscure frontier postseparating Poland and Czechoslovakia. In 1938 several Polish divi-sions occupied Szczecin, and his father, a bookkeeper; was asoldier in the invading force.On the way to Czenstochova, Srebrnik stopped at Auschwitz.Though the sombre concentration camp did not move him to theextent he thought it would, he was glad that he had seen the in-famous place where some of his parents’ relatives had perished.Henry Siebrnik:seaivhing for motsCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy167A sudden wind brings rain.

If my daughter evercomes here, all she will find will be the great, sprawling, glower-ing Huta. The peasant women will be gone and no one will remem-ber the Jewish cemetery.And what of it - if the Jews are gone?166CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy‘‘They steal the flowers off the gravestones and sell them,” Mariahad told me, speaking of Polish poverty and Polish greed andPolish thieves; she herself a Pole. “They steal gravestones andsmooth them over and sell them.

Whenwe came back, she was dead.“Toppled right over into the potatoes she was peeling, onto theknife,” we heard the nuns whispering. “The knife stuck in herface. And we spoke with her just an hour before.”But the girl. Oh, the young Jewish girl! Beautiful with Garbo hair,thin white body in the snow. Jewish girl dead in the Polish woods,mouth packed with snow, open eyes covered with dirt and snow.The snow was high in the empty fields. We walked quickly, twobundled figures — a woman and a little girl. She was scared, thisPolish woman. She knew my mother was never coming back andshe was scared. “If the Germans find you with me. . .

It is the subject of numerous books, movies and tele-vision features. Until some 25 years ago, survivors often did notwish to talk about their experiences. They felt guilt or pain. Thischanged only recently, as the ranks of the survivors began todwindle and “revisionists” claimed that the Holocaust neveroccurred.The Holocaust remains, however, an undeniable historic event. Tbteach its history, a vast, complex and profoundly disturbing sub-ject, may be deeply upsetting. But its lesson must be transmittedand understood by every generation. It ought to be shared by allfaiths, all ethnic groups and nationalities. If we do not learn frompast tragedies, we risk their repetition.This attempt of genocide did occur in reputedly “civilized”countries. We are forced to realize that people are not only cap-able of great achievements, but also of unspeakable cruelty. Toignore it, is to deny reality. The Holocaust represents the mostextreme and destructive consequences of bigotry. In itssystematic planning and cold-blooded efficient execution, theNazi persecution of the Jews was a unique event in the historyof genocides.With few exceptions, the treatment of Jews in the Nazi-occupiedcountries followed the example of Germany. Civil rights weredenied, property was confiscated and all aspects of daily life werecontrolled by the Nazis. Gentiles had a choice: they could followthe majority in aiding and abetting the murderers, or they couldquietly retain their humanity and follow their conscience. In doingthe latter, some of them became heroes, unsung heroes until now.May the perpetrators of evil never be forgotten and the Righteousforever remembered.162CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leeacfcg MYOM HASHOAHYom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, is designatedto commemorate the 6 million Jewish people who were murderedin the Holocaust. The 27th day of Nisan was declared by theKnesset of Israel as Yom Hashoah because it marked thebeginning of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. It is observed byJews around the world and has become an integral part of ourheritage and calendar.

But the rest of the Germanarmy was not adverse to taking part in shootings and humiliationof Jews.It was almost standard procedure. Right after the victoriousGerman armies, came the Gestapo with their files. In those fileswere the names of Jewish leaders and prominent persons whomthe Gestapo would round up in order to ship them to Auschwitz.The Jews were expendable and their extermination continued ata rapid pace. The railway lines leading to Auschwitz were neverbombed — the area was out of reach of American warplanes, themen in the War Department claimed.But these same men could order the air force to bomb factoriesfive miles from the concentration camp. Jewish leaders in thiscountry swallowed it all. They did not want to hamper the wareffort.That September brought countless tragedies, enough to fillthe history books forever.Transport of Jews waiting inside the Auschwitz gates.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy159Jews Viewed as Expendableas German Armies AdvancedBy Arno Herzberg(JTA)For Jews, September 1, 1939 is a day that confirmed the oldadage that Jews will be victims of upheaval and war, that they areexpendable, that their fate is of no concern to the great makersand shakers of this world.This day was significant not only because it showed how little theWestern democracies were prepared to cope militarily with thepower, tactics and methods of Nazi Germany. For Jews, it was theend of all efforts to save our people from the clutches of the mostvicious criminals in history.Emigration out of Germany slowed to a trickle on that day, andthe physical extermination of Jews was brought a decisive stepcloser.I had always feared that the Nazis would resort to measuresbeyond the imagination of a normal person if war ever broke out;that they would want to get rid of Jews so that they did not haveto feed them.When war did break out, the Nazis were no longer concerned howthe world would react to their behavior. The so-called civilized na-tions saw the cruelties the Nazis dealt out in Austria and Czech-oslovakia, as in Vienna, where the Jews had to scrub the sidewalkswith their bare hands. The Allies had signaled to them long ago,in the Conference of Evian and elsewhere, that they could do withthe Jews as they pleased.In this war, the fate of the Jews was bound up with the advanceof the German armies. First came the conquest of Poland, withits millions of Jews; then France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark,Norway; then Hungary, Yugoslavia and Greece, and finally, theSoviet Union.158CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegaaOne of the Torahs is to be dedicated to Abramowicz’s andRapaport’s synagogue, Temple Beth Torah, in Westbury, and oneto Harry’s parents’ synagogue, Congregation B’nai Israel, in Pair-lawn, New Jersey.

On that date, most of the people did not return homeafter work, but went directly to the illegal meeting which tookplace at the former pubhc bank of Aleia 22. All the entrances andexits were barred. Over a thousand people attended this meeting.Strong words to protest the enforcement of compulsory labouramong the Jewish people came first from Rosenwein, Szyldhausand Szmulewicz. It was decided that all those in the forced labourgroup, regardless of their political views, would be protected. Thisillegally organized group became the basis for the futureresistance movement in the small ghetto.Zvi Rosenwein was one of the pioneers of the resistance movementin Czenstochova. This resistance to the oppression of the Jewsby the Nazi regime was followed by the leader of the uprising inthe Warsaw Ghetto. Rosenwein was advised to continue to spreadhis revolutionary movement in other cities and, while on a mis-sion to Bendzin, he became the actual leader of the resistancemovement in that town. After the downfall of Hitler’s Germany,Rosenwein was in a D.R Camp at Einring, in the American zoneof Germany. He soon became a member of the Central Commit-tee of the Czenstochover survivors and a member of the culturalcommittee. He was also involved in the preparations of the book“Churban Czenstochov”.In 1949, Zvi Rosenwein moved to New York and became thesecretary of the Czenstochover Society and Social Club. He con-tinued his activity and was co-editor of the book “Czenstochov”,which was published in New York in 1958. That same year, he wasinvolved in the publication of a series of articles under his literaryname, Zvain.Zvi Rosenwein is one of the outstandingly colourful personalitiesin the history of Czenstochova. He will always be remembered fororganizing the heroic resistance against the barbaric Nazi regime.Abram Bomba, a HolocaustSurvivor, holding a 'HolocaustTorah'’ rescued in Czenstochova.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy153Zvi RosenweinTranslated from YiddishThe name Rosenwein grew to be a symbol of resistance amongthose of the younger generation of Czenstochov who were readyto fight under his leadership in their besieged city of Czen-stochova during the Nazi regime of World War II.Zvi was born in Czenstochova on December 18, 1918, to a strictlyorthodox family. He received a general religious education andwas an avid reader. He was influenced by the works of A.D. Gordonwho called upon the Jewish youth to abandon their lives in thediaspora.In 1932, Zvi became involved in the organization “Gordonia”, andsubsequently climbed the social ladder. In the following year, herepresented his organization with lectures on Zionism andSocialism. In 1938, at the age of 20, he wrote a column “Underthe Shadow of Extinction’’ in the weekly Czenstochover Press.World War II, 1939, the German motorized military units occupiedCzenstochova. Rosenwein continued to face the fight againsthunger, starvation and epidemic sickness. He had to reorganize“Halutz farm’’, long-time known to Czenstochova. In this activity,he could continue to do the illegal work among the Jewish youthin the city. He called an emergency conference in Warsaw withthe participation of Tzivia Lubetkin and Joseph Kaplan. The pathfor an international alertness was paved at that conference.Rosenwein became one of the main leaders of this illegal organi-zation. Illegal meetings were held regularly at the homes of MalkaWeltman on Berka Joselewicza 1, Cela Katz on Warszavska, HelaFriedman on Garncarska, and Mania Szczeczura on Kedrzynska.Rosenwein attended all of these meetings and encouraged actionsto fight the Nazis.Very unpleasant times had begun with the steady hunting downand rounding up of Jewish people who were sent to forced labour.At the working sites, they were beaten and insulted. Zvi Rosen-wein was among those apprehended for forced labour.

By then about170,000 German Jews were left to be exterminated, now that emi-gration had become an impossibility. The phase that Crystal Nighthad opened enabled perhaps 80,000 German Jews to emigrate in1939, as the result of world indignation. It made room for the“final solution”, which affected my brother, Fritz Hermann, andmany other relatives who did not make it before the closing of thegates.Would it have been possible to save more in 1939?

The profit that went to theSS was unbelievable.One morning the PA system bellowed: ‘All Jews who own a carreport at the gate immediately”. Many did — and were relieved oftheir property at one-tenth or less its value. We were working inthe quarries and were told to avoid looking at the house of theCommander, SS Colonel Koch (later executed by the Nazis them-selves). His wife. Use (known for her interest in tattoos and lampshades made of human skin showing interesting tattoos), waslooking for potential victims. The work in the quarries was make-believe work, seemingly without value, but a great opportunityfor the supervisors to beat us. Young men who were healthy couldsurvive, as I did; men in their 50s and 60s were just driven to“normal” deaths.Even among the SS, there were human beings as well as beasts.Some used every opportunity to be cruel, others seemed curiouslymatter-of-fact. Inside the camp proper, you saw the bulk of the“real” inmates, mainly Gentiles. Some were political activists(who seemed to fare quite well), some homosexuals, some ex-jail-birds who had not been let go after their sentence had been servedbut placed in Buchenwald; some Jehovali’s Witnesses, some oldand practically dying, some looking rather healthy in spite of allthe suffering.But I recall an old, slim man, with a two-by-four in place of a leg.An SS officer who knew him, exclaimed upon seeing him, “Areyou still alive? I’ll bring you some rope tonight and you can hangyourself.” The next morning we had a long roll call while they cuthim off a tree and dragged him to his block comrades so that theelder could report “Strength, 380. Now, 379 present, and onecorpse’ ’.On another occasion, as I stook at the fence and near a watchtower, suddenly something was thrown down at me. It turned outto be a perfectly good and tasty sandwich. Obviously, the SS manon the tower had a heart.After a week or two inside the real camp, we were returned to thestables. By that time rumors had it that those whose emigrationpapers were ready could be released. Indeed, this is what hap-pened. After about 2'/: months in Buchenwald, my name was call-ed to report at the gate. I was told that I would be released thenext morning “to continue to prepare Jewish youth for emigra-tion at the ‘Juedische Anlernwerkstatt’ in Frankfurt/Main.”It turned out that this ORT-type school had been taken over bythe Gestapo, or SS, to further Jewish emigration through voca-tional training. I had taught there for over two years when I was150CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyOthers had committed suicide by various means, or died fromnatural causes. Our arrests had been chaotic: some of the black-shirts were relatively human, others sadists with a killer instinct.I still recall the Frankfurt/Main exhibition hall where we wereassembled and thoroughly disoriented, the transport to therailway station on trucks (“keep your heads on your knees, who-ever raises his head only a second will be shot”), the long trainride to Weimar, the renewed cruelties on the way to Buchenwaldand then the long wait on the parade grounds, from 6 in the morn-ing to 4 p.m.Suddenly, over the PA system, a voice shouted, “If another ofthose Jews hangs himself, will he please first put a piece of paperwith his name on it in his pocket so that we know who the hellhe is.”As the day progressed and we stood and waited, we relievedourselves in our pants, tried to help some older men who hadfainted by just propping them up. Now and then a Kapo camealong and beat some up. The machine guns on the watch towerswere moved like searchlights over us. When one man screamedout loud, “Sh’ma Yisrael’’, a crackling and seemingly drunk voiceshouted over the PA “Pick him up and take him to the bunker;we’ll take care of him tonight.’’ We knew what it meant withoutbeing told.Late in the afternoon, we were given something to eat, whalegoulash. It caused immediate diarrhea. By then we had been putin barracks which were really stables. Rows of planks in three orfour layers served as beds, and we were so crowded that most ofus could only sleep on our sides to save space. Of course, therewere no blankets, not even straw. In fact, the man on my rightdid not get up next morning. He had died in his sleep and wedragged him out for roll call.I will never forget this first night — it was, again, a preview ofhell. Men who had to relieve themselves, used their hats; ten-markbills served as toilet paper and, as had happened the night before,some went insane and were beaten to death. Early in the morn-ing we were permitted to use the “toilets’’ — open ditches withraw lumber to sit on.Rumours spread like wildfire: we would be working at something;we would be released soon; we would stay on and on; and ourhopes made a skydive when we were properly admitted and someof us, perhaps 1,000, put into the real camp. I was one of them.Of the many impressions that I gained and often recall in night-mares to this day, one will do: the utter corruption of the place.CZENSTOCHOV — Our Leffocy149Witness of Shattering CrystalBy Henry WarschauerReprinted from the ''Canadian Jewish News'' of November 10, 1978The most brutal rehearsal for the Holocaust took place insideGermany, in full view of a passive German population, betweenNovember 9 and November 12, 1938. The event, known as if toprettify the pogrom, was “Crystal Night”, the night of brokenglass, and remembered by Jews all over the world as the begin-ning of the “final solution”. The 40th anniversary of the eventgives me cause to jot down these facts and memories which I feelshould never be forgotten.Under the Goebbels-organized cover of “spontaneous demonstra-tions of irate citizens” following the death of a German embassyofficial in Paris on November 9, which also was the anniversaryof the unsuccessful Hitler uprising of 1923. 171 synagogues wereset ablaze all over Germany, and others wantonly destroyed.In the course of these operations, which stretched into Novem-ber 10, 91 Jews were murdered, many others severely woundedand, in broad daylight, more than 7,000 Jewish-owned businesses,including 29 of the largest and world-famous department stores,destroyed. Also, beginning November 10, and ending only Novem-ber 12, some 25,000 male adult Jews were arrested by the GestapxDand taken to the three largest concentration camps.So it was that on November 11 or 12,1 found myself in the recentlyestablished concentration camp Buchenwald, together withalmost half the 25,000 arrested Jews.The camp was completely unprepared for our arrival. As we nowknow, on November 9, before our arrival, the camp count had been9,842 inmates. Fbur days later, thanks to us, it had risen to 19,676.There was not enough water or food, nor barrack or toilets, toaccommodate us. In fact, by the time we arrived, the first grouphad already been decimated by men who had gone insane, runberserk and been clubbed to death by Kapos, as well as Jews whohad taken it upon themselves to “put some order into this chaos”.148CZENSTOCHOV - Our LcjThe Holy Bible for the Germans was Hitler’s “Mein Kampf’’, aninspiration for hate, brutality and murder.Idzihowsky, the lawyer who was officially appointed to defendKestner, declared that his client was only a small pin in Hitler smachine.

KielE. Chrobolowskiand wife HelenLi. BrenerCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy147The Nazi Murderer KestnerBefore the Court of JusticeTranslated from YiddishKestner, a typical German gendarme, born in Sosnie (Silesia),spoke fluent Polish. Of sadistic behavior, just like the other Nazidegenerates, he was appointed, along with another bandit,Lashinsky, to liquidate the so-called “small ghetto” in Czensto-chova. Their level of brutality was far greater than that of theghetto Commandant Tzopot.When, in the summer of 1943, the German rulers suspected thatthe Jewish resistance movement was preparing a military attack,they found it necessary to give Kestner and Lashinsky, the jobof removing and liquidating the small Jewish ghetto inCzenstochova. Kestner completed his mission splendidlyAs witness and accused, Kestner declared that he did not recallexactly how many people he had murdered with his own hands. . . “maybe 300 or 800 people”. He admitted that he had murdered“only” 22. As the trial progressed, it became clear that his crimeswere horrible.Statements by witnesses, such as Owieczka, Koniecpolski, Szpitz,Kromolowski and Zelkowicz, were heard. They had hved throughthe liquidation of the small ghetto where thousands of ourbrothers and sisters were murdered. They described how Kestnercoldbloodedly shot several bullets into the heart of a little girlwhom he swung by her hair. Savagely he murdered children andhelpless elderly. These are only fragments of Kestner’s“activities”.The prosecutor, Kazinsky, called the German nation ‘ ‘a horde ofcattle who followed their leader blindly, even into inhumanity”.Hitler, one of the greatest criminals in history, lived by theteachings of Friedrich Wilhelm, who believed that the Germanscould only be ruled by a dictator. According to Hans Frank, whowas sentenced to be hanged by the 1946 International Tribunalin Niirenberg, “Whatever served the German Nation was lawful”.146CZENSTOCHOV - Our LeeracyThe disappearance of so many started rumors. Himmler statedthat all Jews were being “resettled in the east”. The mails werein operation throughout the war, but there were no letters. Swisssalesmen were allowed in and out of Germany and some said theyhad met soldiers who told them of seeing “hundreds of Jews inbig open graves”. The Swiss did not believe it.On December 8, 1942, Joseph Goebbels said “treatment of theJews is a delicate question” that ought not to be asked. The Inter-national Red Cross was kept from the concentration camps, andordered not to transmit messages to and from Jews.The news reached London, however, and the slaughter of a millionJews was reported. Winston Churchill had no comment. FbreignSecretary Anthony Eden said he didn’t believe the story. The U.S.Embassy in Berne cryptically told the story as a sort of postscriptto its regular messages.The New York Times published British reports about the holocauston June 30, 1942, and July 2, but printed the story in the middleof the paper. In Palestine, Hebrew newspapers deplored thepublishing of “unproven and exaggerated rumors”. InfluentialBritish Jews wanted to suppress the story for fear of arousingHitler to greater crimes.New York’s Rabbi Stephen Wise, worried about whether to keepsilent, but held a press conference in October, 1942, and announc-ed that half of Poland’s Jews — 2 million — had been killed by theNazis.The same month. Prof. Felix Frankfurter saw Roosevelt and toldhim the story. The president said not to worry. The Jews werebeing used by the Germans to build fortifications on the Russianfrontier.At almost the same time, a Polish emissary named Jan Karskyrelated to Frankfurter the detailed story of the Holocaust. Frank-furter said: “I can’t believe you.”The leaders of the free world felt they could do nothing about it.It was all too far away.Matzohs for Pesach 1945By Cheryl SemskyThere was a religious man in Czenstochova named NoahEdelist. After the liberation, Mr. Edelist came to see my father,Morris Semsky. He was very concerned that there would be nomatzohs for Pesach. He asked if there were any other bakers stillalive. My father told him about Jack Shipper and NathanEilenberg. Mr. Edelist and his friends found a “bakery” that wasvery dirty. They got to work, roUed up their sleeves and cleanedit. They were given some flour. Thanks to Mr. Edelist, Czensto-chova had matzohs for Passover.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Le^cacy145Holocaust was **Too Far Away**By Jim BishopWhen World War II ended, a grave question arose: “When didthe Allies learn of the extermination of the Jews, and what didthey do about it?” The question has been asked for many years.Authors in untold numbers have ransacked the old files inWashington, London and Berlin; but they have all drawn blanks.Except one, Walter Laqueur, a writer with the tenacity of a bull-dog. I read his book, “The Terrible Secret'\ all day yesterday andpart of the night. It is a document that portrays an eerie partner-ship between Hitler and Churchill and Roosevelt.Many historians date the beginning of the Holocaust as January1942, because that is when Himmler convened the Wannseeconference for the “final solution” of the Jewish problem. The con-ference endorsed what had been going on since June 1941 — thekilling of 500,000 Jews.The special SS units, Einsatzgruppen, had been selected for theextermination. The first camp, Chelmno, was already operating.A few camps were set up in Germany, but the big ones were allin Poland. Some observers forget that over 3 million Poles wereslain, as well as 6 million Jews.In the fiery fury of a world at war, very few — even among Jews— wanted to believe that a selected group of civilians, all acrossthe face of Europe, would be slaughtered. Some cited the tremen-dous cost to Hitler and the loss of manpower at the front, to affordthousands of Einsatzgruppen working hard to round up and shipthe defenseless in cattle cars from such remote areas as Brest andthe Crimea.The Germans began the killing on June 22, 1941, slaughtering2,000 Jews in Bialistock and, a few days later, 7,000 in Lvov. TheNazis didn’t master the technique of their holocaust until thesummer of 1942. By that time, big camps were at Belzec, Sobibor,Treblinka, Auschwitz and Majdanek.144CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leff&cyThe revolts in the Warsaw and other ghettos against insuperableodds aroused the admiration of freedom lovers all over the world.It was the faith and conviction of the Jewish resistance which en-abled them to make the Warsaw ghetto into a symbol of heroismfor all times.A basic law of sociology states that a minority tries to resemblethe majority among which it lives, as far as life-style and evenways of thinking and cultural values are concerned. This is alsotrue of the Jews, expecially since they had broken out of the ghettowalls and become members of the Western world’s open society.Yet in this “civilized” world, heroism and physical bravery areoften thought to be identical. People are brought up on this con-cept and are prepared to shed their own and others’ blood in itsname.No effort was spared by Jews to continue the observation ofreligious precepts under German rule, to keep the Sabbath ascommanded, to refrain from forbidden foods, to hold prayers onthe holy days, to blow the shofar and eat matzot. All this actuallywent on at the time of the Holocaust in all the camps.It was this spiritual heroism that existed in the dark years of theHolocaust. Despite the horrifying conditions resulting from theNazi’s crimes in the labor camps, ghettos and concentrationcamps, the Jews — rabbis and leaders, as well as the commonpeople — preserved the image of human beings. This was trueheroism and it is this type of heroism that we must stress.One is amazed to read documents written underground whichreveal the Jewish spirit in all its splendor. Wonderful manifesta-tions of mutual help and of leadership frequently encouraged theJewish people at that fateful hour. Here was the real greatness !It is within this framework, therefore — and not as a separate andisolated phenomenon — that one should regard the ghetto rebels,the overwhelming majority of whom were Zionists. They drewtheir inspiration from the spiritual greatness of the Jewish people. . . from their belief both in its past and its future.Czenstochover Independent Society in ChicagoCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy143Jews Shouldn’t FeelGuilt nor Shame for HolocaustThe period of the European Holocaust causes some Jews,especially among the younger generation, feelings of uneasinessand even guilt. The question has often been asked: Why did theJews go as lambs to the slaughter instead of putting upresistance?The question has only one answer: whoever asks it showsignorance and a lack of understanding of what actually happenedin Europe during World War II.Today, in retrospect, we are beginning (and only beginning) tograsp the power of forces of evil at work then. At the time,however, nobody in his wildest dreams could have imagined thathuman beings were capable of what the Germans did.However, the post-Auschwitz world, far from faultless as itcertainly is, does not resemble the world before the gas chambersand concentration camps. A new dimension of man’s degradationnow accompanies us from here to eternity. We often experiencea sense of insecurity and uncertainty out of fear of the possibilitythat what happened may recur, against the Jewish people andother human groups.But, to return to the question: why did the Jews not revolt? Theanswer is clear. During World War II the Germans killed over20 million people of various nationalities. We heard hardly any-thing of revolt from them. Apparently it was made almost impos-sible to resist physically and if this was true of the gentiles whodwelt in their own countries and possessed armies and arma-ments, it was even truer of the Jews. The Jews, after all, con-stituted a minority and to a large extent alien element in the coun-tries of Europe.These are the objective facts and there is no point in sufferingfrom feelings of guilt or shame just because there were no Davidsto fight the German Gohath. David, in his time, fought in his owncountry, using a sling and stones as weapons.142CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe most important fact to remember is that the Nazi Holocaustwas a singular event in the history of humankind, without prece-dent. Never before had the might of the military, the power of thelegislature and enmity of the general population united againsta segment of its citizens that comprised 0.8% of the total popula-tion. The mechanical mass-murder system of an Auschwitz hadnever happened before. There was no ready-made psychologicalweapon to meet it.Miraculously, throughout this unremitting tale of horror,barbarism and evil, there also were many instances of moralityand righteousness, all the more to be emphasized and celebratedas they happened truly at the lowest p)oint of human conduct.Often putting their own and their family’s lives in danger, someChristians hid Jews from the Nazis, or helped them escape tosafety. The people of Denmark as a whole defied Hitler’s ordersand Germany’s military might, and refused to hand over theirJewish citizens for slaughter. These individuals have come to beknown as the Righteous Gentiles. One of these brace and reso-lute individuals was Raoul Wallenberg, a young Swedish diplomatwho saved 100,000 Hungarian Jews in 1944 at great personaldanger, and who may still be held prisoner by the Soviet Union.On a smaller scale, but nevertheless just as bravely, the Germanfactory owner Schindler saved 300 Jewish laborers by single-handedly retrieving them from transports to concentrationcamps. He fed and housed them in his own labor camp, and keptthem working in his factory until the war was over. Others tookJewish children, raised them as their own, and thus saved theirlives. Had any been found out, they and their families could havebeen executed.These Righteous Gentiles, and many thousands of others, provedthat there was a choice: they could follow the majority and aidand abet the murderers, or they could quietly retain their humani-ty, follow their conscience and be the until-now unsung heroesof a horrendous and shameful time in history.May the perpetrators of evil never be forgotten, and the Righteousforever remembered.Dr. Emanuel Ringelblum was among the first to writean historical book about Czenstochova.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy141Hitler was quick to exploit the world’s failure to act on behalf ofthe Jews. It vindicated his policies, and hastened the implemen-tation of the “final solution’’.With few exceptions the treatment of Jews in the Nazi occupiedcountries followed the example of Germany. Civil rights wereeliminated, property and businesses confiscated, and daily lifewas subject to the whim of the Nazis.Ghettoization of Jews began in earnest now, which meant that allJews living in a particular town or city were herded into one sec-tor, the area was closed off, usually with barbed wire and guardsoutside the entrance. Jews of small towns were also brought tothis gathering p)oint, so that thousands of people inhabited spacemeant for a few hundred. Having their intended victims in oneconvenient location simplified the work of the Nazis for the timewhen transports of Jews began leaving for the death camps.Meanwhile, inside the Ghetto, life was unbearable. Fbod wasalmost impossible to get, water supplies were inadequate,medicine not available, and the sanitary system, primitive at best,was totally insufficient. Disease ran rampant among the half-starved inhabitants, and typhus outbreaks killed thousands daily.With the benefit of hindsight, we now wonder why the Jewsallowed this to happen. Why didn’t they fight back, we ask. Therewere many reasons, but we can discuss some of the most impor-tant ones. The humiliating treatment, loss of all civil rights andphysical and economic deprivation had its desired effect. The Jewswere demoralized, helpless, totally at the mercy of a murderousgovernmental policy. One of the most difficult to accept was thecomplicity, or at best indifference, of the neighbors and the restof the world. People they grew up with, lived and worked with sud-denly became deadly enemies. The soul crushing realization ofhaving spent one’s life as a loyal German subject, going and try-ing to be as much like a “true’’ German as jxDSsible all were exer-cises in futility. The tragic self-delusion of the emancipated andassimilated Jew culminated in passive resignation to the in-evitable. The normal human reaction to such extreme contradic-tion was shock and a denial of reality. The emotional trauma,together with the insidious, deceptive way the government car-ried out its plans for the “final solution’’ of the Jews, checked theability of the victims to organize and fight back. There were excep-tions, of course, as some Jews did join partisans and other counterinsurgency groups. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising is probably thebest known act of resistance by Jews, but certainly not the onlyone. Resignation and denial were the operative emotions of themajority of the victims, however.140CZENSTOCHOV - Our LesacyThe danger these “subhumans” represented was described as sogreat that any means at the disposal of the Aryans had to be imple-mented to save the world from the evil designs of the Jews. Mobhysteria has nothing to do with logic. It must be added that theconfiscation of “Aryanization”, of Jewish property did not fail toplease the masses. The later boycotting of Jewish businesses alsobenefited the Gterman merchants — it eliminated competition. Thefirst step in the Nazi “race purification” program was the exclu-sion of all Jews from government position, civil services, and thearmy, followed by the firing of all Jewish teachers, professors,scientists, artists, musicians. This move accomphshed two impor-tant goals: by removing their means of making a living, it impo-verished the Jews, while at the same time separating them fromthe rest of society. This separation was later enhanced by the man-datory yellow arm band all Jews had to wear in public. In 1935,when the infamous “Nuremberg Laws” were passed, the effec-tive exclusion of Jews from the economy was complete, as wellas the total loss of their legal and civil rights. These laws decreedthat only persons of “German blood” (Aryans) could be citizensof the Reich, while persons of “impure blood” (non-Aryans) wereinferior and were “subjects” of the State but not citizens. Thus,Jews legally became second-class citizens at the mercy of thegovernment, defenseless to fight against eviction from job andproperty.Hitler was figuratively “testing the water” with his progressive-ly more restricting and more brutal laws and actions, and he wasnot getting opposition to them from the population or from thecountries of the free world. In 1938, during the “Kxistalnacht”,the Night of Broken Glass, Nazi thugs destroyed and lootedJewish businesses, assaulted and murdered Jews they caught,burned synagogues and much Jewish property all acrossGermany. Between 20,000 and 30,000 Jews were arrested thatnight and sent to concentration camps. Then, to add insult to in-jury, Jews were forced to pay one billion marks in fines so thatthe German insurance companies could reimburse Christian busi-nessmen who might also have suffered losses during the lootingand vandalism. The resulting silence of the international com-munity seemed to provide Hitler with a carte blanche for hispolicies. No one would raise a hand on behalf of the Jews. Hitlerreceived more encouragement for his repressive, brutal policiesthat year from the free world at the conclusion of the Evian Con-ference. 32 countries sent representatives to Evian in July, 1938to formulate a plan that would get the beleaguered Jews out ofGermany and Austria and help them be absorbed in volunteeringfree nations. The Conference was no more than an empty gesture.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legate139Traditional Anti'Semitism2k;hor-ChicagoTraditional anti-Semitism was based on the fact that Jews refusedto accept Jesus as their redeemer, and as the centuries rolled on,still refused to convert to Christianity. It was standard churchteaching to condemn and ostracize the Jew for this refusal. Theireternal wandering and constantly being at the mercy of Chris-tians served to confirm the seeming truth of church teaching thattheir wretched condition was a punishment from G—d for refus-ing to believe in the “true” faith. The fact that Jews were forcedto flee from one place to the next due to the hostility of theChristian community, and did not choose this miserable form ofexistence of their own volition, did not seem to negate the argu-ment of the church. By the 18th century, greater stress was placedon economic and p)olitical anti-Semitism. Under Hitler, racial anti-Semitism took on a still newer slant. According to Nazi theory,the inherent evil of Jews did not arise from their “mistaken”religious beliefs, or their economic role, but from their very being,their very identity, as Jews. Literally, he claimed the evil was intheir blood. Also according to Nazi ideology, Germans were thehighest level of the Aryan “race”, while Jews were subhuman.These subhumans, amazingly, were accused of trying to subvertand undermine the structure of world affairs, and deprive theAryan super-race of its rightful position — that of world domina-tion. Nazi theorists insisted that democracy, liberahsm, socialismand communism were all destructive Jewish notions that wouldonly deprive the superior race of power and authority. How sub-humans who were described as vermin could obtain the power tobe a threat to a super-race was never questioned. The German peo-ple, conditioned by centuries of anti-Semitism, fell into line onceagain and helped Hitler into power.Once Hitler was appointed Chancellor on January 30, 1933, racistdoctrine became an integral part of the totalitarian regime, openlyexpressed and practiced. Hitler appointed himself a kind of“Defender of the Race”. Sporadic violence by Nazi thugs againstJews accelerated and was condoned, even justified, by the State.138CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyG—d was never more immediate nor salvation more attainable. Asan adult, sitting next to my parents in shul on the high holidays,I often wondered what gave them the strength to return to thehouse of prayer and what meaning they possibly could have foundin those prayers after That Night.A second eventful date and turning point in my mother’s psycho-emotional calendar was the 17th of January. She was liberatedthat day, gaining her physical freedom from the bondage ofHasag. She was fond of recalling how four starving young womenheld on to one another, barely able to walk until they found andoccupied an abandoned apartment on Krutka Street. The placewas freezing cold and the girls, wearing heavy men’s boots andmink coats they found in the apartment, had to drag coals fromanother part of Czenstochova in a wheelbarrow.There were other ‘little’ miracles which took place after the 17th.When their meager supply of coal ran out Tolla, Hella, Malla andLutka went into a Russian-run factory which manufactured heat-ing ovens and asked to be hired. The Soviet officer in charge, hischest full of medals, understood that what they really wanted wasan oven. To their astonishment he dispatched one of his employeeswith a brand new oven saying: “Make sure it works perfectlybefore you come back!’’ As the girls thanked him he whispered:“Ich bin oich a Yid.’’As I reflect upon my relationship with my own children I becomeconscious of the child that I am. None of us are quite as free aswe would like to believe; there is more of our parents within usthan we are willing to acknowledge, for better or for worse. We,whose parents were tried and tested against their will in the worstof all possible crucibles, somehow must distill from their experi-ences only the noblest lessons and incorporate them into thefabric of our lives. Then we must pass these lessons on. Fbr alltimes.Menachem Botstein and his mother, Tblla RotsztajnCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy137shortly before my birth they must have made a conscious decisionnever to speak Pohsh in the presence of their children. To theirmind Polish, rather than German, stood for all that was despicableand evil in their world. I have not understood it nor have I soughtan explanation.I know, however, that were it not for my mother’s gentile friend,Hella, who risked her life on several occasions, one of my uncleswould surely have perished. Also, my mother’s blond hair, blueeyes and fluency in Polish must certainly have been the reasonshe was permitted to move freely carrying goods between Klobuck,on the so-called German side of the border, and Czenstochovawhich was part of the General Gk)ubernement during thoseterrible days. Ironically, in the final hours of her life, under heavysedation, my mother again spoke Polish, praying to G~d to blessand protect those whom she was leaving.As their rejection of Polish symbolized bitterness toward theirbirthplace, my parents steadfast devotion to Yiddish was per-haps their way of holding on to the memory of their beloved kin.Growing up in Israel, I recall my mother often being chidedpublicly: “Why don’t you speak Hebrew to your son?!” To whichshe would reply: ‘T’m not worried about his Hebrew. But how willhe know what his grandfather said?” If a miracle should occurand my grandparents would once again walk on this earth, howwould I address them, was her concern. I am indeed indebted tomy parents’ foresight and to their courage to withstand thecriticism of the enlightened ones. Yiddish has provided me somewonderful moments of emotional as well as intellectual delights.Children of survivors have learned another way of reckoning time.Fbr their parents, time came to a standstill on one fateful day.Nothing was ever the same since. The calendar is a heartlesscalculator, evolving with precise regularity, triggering at giventimes uncontrollably powerful inner responses. Fbr as long as shelived my mother dreaded the coming of Yom Kippur, lending anadded dimension to the meaning Days of Awe.Inevitably, on that day she became withdrawn and silent. Herfasting brought on a severe migraine resulting in her losing con-sciousness, accompanied by fits of nausea and hallucinations. Adoctor would have to be summoned. It was only during my lateteens when I realized that it was on the night following YomKippur in 1942 that the first massive roundup (aktion) of Czen-stochover Jews took place, when my mother’s parents and all ofher married siblings and their children were taken away. ThatYom Kippur was to be the last time my mother had a ‘home’ inthe most elementary sense of that word. That Yom Kippur, I wastold, there was not a dry eye in the shtiblech and synagogues ofCzenstochova. Everyone fasted, all felt compelled to be in shul.136CZENSTOCHOV - Our LeeacyGrowing Up with CzenstochovBy Menachem David RotsteinIn memory of Tolla Unglik-RotsztajnOne of the first books I remember looking at was written in alanguage I could not then read. What remains in my mind quitevividly however, is an illustration of a female angel, her back archedand a bayonet piercing her slender body Below her is a headstone— a matzevah — inscribed in Hebrew. Page after page the same il-lustration on the glossy paper; only the names of the dead are dif-ferent and the number of gravestones seems endless. I think thatthis was how I first learned to count.Had they known what an unsettling effect these drawings hadon my impressionable mind, my parents would no doubt have hid-den the book and kept it under lock and key. I must have askedwhat kind of book this was, where it came from, and how it cameinto their possession. I don’t remember their answer, but now Iknow.The book which still remains etched upon my memory is calledChurban Czenstochov, the first memorial book printed in com-memoration of that destroyed Polish community. It came out lessthan two years after liberation, written in Yiddish, and printedin German font. The book had a brown cover depicting menacingfactory chimneys with the letters HASAG boldly written acrossthe top.Hasag is one of those words survivors’ children like myself grewup with. Other words were Lager, JFhr die Krieg, and Die DritteAlley. In between I heard these names: Soreh-Iteh, Moishe-Isser,Primmet, Roochel, Pineches, Hendle and so on and on and on. Iknow them all. I know them in the order they were born and theprofession they practiced, which of them were married and whichhad children. As well, I know the names of the towns aroundCzenstochova from which some of their spouses came: Klobuck,Kshepitz and Yanov.I know the language they all spoke. I know that my parents bothlearned Polish, but I never heard it spoken in our home. SometimeCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy135When it came my turn to say a few words of comfort to the fewhundred people, words these Jews so desperately needed to hear,I could only say the following:‘If this is what is left of our great community of Czenstochova,then our destruction is more complete than we thought.’Then I broke down in tears, and all the rest of the gathering criedwith me.Dr. Benjamin Ornstein, another speaker at that meeting, writesmore about that episode on page 64 of the book “Czestochowa”,published in New York in 1958.Many changes took place in the life of each individual and in thelives of Jews in general since 1946. And yet, those frighteningpictures follow me wherever I go. I see those pained and thin faces,those fear-filled eyes, full of pleading to hear a consoling wordfrom me. And I fear to see their eyes full of tears. How badly Iwanted to say some consoling words to them, but instead theyheard only my cries.In my sleepless nights, they appear again in my mind, theshadows of those faces from that barrack in the camp of Felda-fing. And I pray that they should never leave me, for they are apart of me. I carry them with me in all my wanderings, and in allmy deep, lonely struggles. Sometimes I wish that I could be backin Feldafing, in that sad gloomily-lit barrack, and that I couldagain look in their young, sad faces, and again see that deep sor-row that will never leave me.I hope that all of you with whom I met at that gathering, live nowin peace and in comfort, and that you have built yourselves yourfamily nests, and that you have nachas from your children andgrandchildren. But the cry and the sadness of that evening in thecamp of Feldafing will always be with us to the end of our daysin this “world of lies”, the world in which we live.Montreal Book Committee, 1966(From left): W.

Klein134CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe Jews in theDisplaced Persons Camps in GermanyBy Zvi Rosenwein(Translated from the Yiddish by Rifka Rosenwein)The life of the Jews, in the displaced persons camps after thedestruction, marks a heartbreaking and awesome chapter inJewish history. The theme is rife with boiling hot drama. It isfrightful to touch that theme and go back to that abyss of sadnessand wails; one filled with deep emotional struggles.It is there that you see the absurdity of continuation and the driveto live. While at the time of the destruction, there was the struggleto survive, in the DP camps emerged a more inward-looking con-flict — the question is it worthwhile to survive? Is it right to sur-vive when so many of our nearest are no more? It was an intensestruggle with G—d and the world; Jewish morality combined withphysical weakness.The struggles and tensions of those times are burdening meforever. Sometimes I try to free myself of those thoughts, to ridmyself of those episodes of despair.About one of those episodes, I would like to write a few lines. Itwas the 26th of June, 1946. I was in the DP camp of Einring,which was near the Austrian border. It was also close to the Hitlerresidence in Berchtesgarden. A group of Jews from Czenstochovawere, at that time, in Camp Peldafing in Bavaria. They invited meto be one of the speakers at a memorial meeting on the yahrzeitof the liquidation of the small Czenstochova ghetto.Fbldafing was a large camp for sick DPs. When I arrived thereand saw how the Jews walked around in hospital uniforms, a yearafter the liberation, I was terribly saddened. I came to the “hall”,really a large wooden barrack. There I was met by several hundredJews from Czenstochova. Most of them were still dressed inhospital clothing.To that gathering, also, came Czenstochover Jews from other citiesin Germany, like Munich and Frankfurt. Many I recognized, butsome I couldn’t: the years in the ghettos and camps had changedtheir looks completely. I cannot recall a time that I was as depress-ed as when I met these Jews.IV AftermathRevival andRemembrance132CZENSTOCHOV ~ Our LegacyI AM ALIVEMy bluebird will swing our grandson's dreamwith buckeyes and green Aprilswith barefooted youthin the white foam of ancient watermills.My bluebird will fly far awayto the honey-nest of grandfather Berlfrom the windy fern he will drinkour tearful pearls.And I, myself, a pre-holocaust echo,a tiny beam in my grandson'sgolden webwill rejoice in Warsaw YiddishYach leyb, yach leyb.CHANAN KIELTHE OLD SYNAGOGUEThe old synagogue — a shrivelled grandfatherwith dreamy windows,drowsy Jews reciting the Psalms.On the roof — homeless dovesbegging for alms.The old synagogue — shrunken, gray,hiding its sadness and fear,quiet and shy,afraid of an evil eye.The old synagogue — in gloomy daysguards the yellow pages of the sleechot,the hasty evening prayers of a cousin,and the childrenlate for Shofer-Blozn.The old synagogue — burned to the ground,my town murdered in cold blood,and we still write them lettersfrom abroad.CHANAN KIELCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy131grave shall also be here”. Nonetheless, he gave me great courageto carry out my plan, so that I could be among the people to avengethe flow of innocent Jewish blood in the death factory.During the nineteen days I spent in Treblinka, we tried to saveas many as we could. We succeeded in sparing the lives of manyCzenstochover Jews: Jacob Eisner (now in Israel), Rapaport (nowin the U.S.A.) and a few others who managed to escape;Pacenovski (now in Israel), Abram Bomba (now in America) ....I escaped on October 21, 1942, and the following day, I wasattacked in the forest, one kilometer from Treblinka by some Pbleswho took my clothing. I was left in my underwear.In the middle of November, 1942, I returned to Czenstochov, tothe small Ghetto. When I told my horror story of what I hadwitnessed in the death eamp of Treblinka, of our families beingkilled by gassing and the burning of their bodies, everyonethought that I was insane and was speaking nonsense.From the small Ghetto, I went to work in the “Meble lager” andmade contact with the underground and encouraged them to fightand escape.In June of 1943, the planned revolt in the small Ghetto wasunsuccessful. In that revolt the greatest of our ghetto heroes werekilled, including my brother, Yitchak Gelbard. It led to the liquida-tion of the small ghetto in Czenstochova.Pupils in the Czenstochover public school, with its directorMs. Szacher in 1932.130CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacybands. They were shouting “All men to the right and women tothe left, all undress fully”. Women and children were chased, inthe nude, by armed S.S. who wished to cut off their hair. Thenthe people were driven through an alley, “Alley of Heaven”, to thegas chambers. They believed that they were going to take ashower.In the meantime, the men were to pick up the strewn clothing and,running naked, they were to bring the clothing far away to adesignated sorting place.All the undressing was done under pressure and harassment, ac-companied by horrible yelling and beating, so as to confuse thevictims about what was actually transpiring.When a subsequent transport of victims arrived, loaded into sixcattle cars, no sign of the previous victims remained.Another group worked in the “Red Camp” at the doors that openedfrom the other side of the gas chambers. At the entrance of thegas chambers, the floor was elevated and gradually sloped. Afterthe gassing, the doors would open and all the corpses would slipinto the pits. A bulldozer would dig day and night to clear the pitsfor the new victims.The deportation of the Czenstochover Jewish population beganthe day following Yom Kippur, on September 22, 1942. Thetransports began to arrive in Treblinka. I went with the fourthtransport and arrived in Treblinka on October 2, 1942, afterspending twenty hours in the cattle train.When the Czenstochover transport arrived, there were many ofour transport chosen to remain working in the camp. I was amongthem. My work was to cut cord to a certain size to be given to eachperson as he arrived from the transport, to tie together his or hershoes. I must confess that for the first two days, I did not realizewhat was happening around me. I came back to my senses tounderstand what I saw with my own eyes — the tragedy and thedestruction of the Jewish people. Among those Czenstochoverchosen to work in the camp, I met Aron Berliner, Moshe Click,two Gelber brothers and many others, whose names I do not recall.I had decided that I would not remain there. I was actually help-ing in the destruction of the Jews by not making an attempt toescape. I also wanted to return to the Ghetto and to the under-ground fighters to make them aware that we had to be preparedto fight the inhuman murderers of our Nation.I had met my friend and teacher whom we had saved, GershonPrentke. I wanted to convince him to partake in my plan to escape.However, he was very depressed and weak and he said: “Here isthe grave of my wife and child and close relatives; therefore, myCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy129Nineteen Days in TreblinkaOriginally written in Yiddish by A. GelbardTreblinka —a place that has never been printed on any map ofPoland, and I am in doubt if any Polish Jew ever knew that sucha place existed. Millions of Jews are now aware of that “unknown”place which became the cemetery of their loved ones.Where is Treblinka? The road that links Warsaw to Bialistock wasa place called Malkin. There was a train station with many trainrails that branched out in many directions. One of the rails ledto a small village called Treblinka. Its inhabitants did not knowabout the technology of the civilized world. They continued tocultivate the fields in a primitive way. They used the wood fromthe nearest forest to heat their homes and cook their meals. In1941, the Nazi beasts ordered the trees of the forest cleared and,on that location, they erected an extermination factory of Germanprecision.The cleared area of the forest was enclosed with barbed wire, thatwas covered with tree branches and leaves in order to mask whatwas going on. There, in a very short time, were built thirteen gaschambers.During my 19-day stay in Treblinka, I witnessed the daily arrivalof three to four transports of six to eight thousand persons pertransport. Quite a number of transports arrived during the night.Special train rails were layed through the camp to allow thetransport to drive directly into the Treblinka station. A locomotivewith six wagons would ride into the camp. The transport wouldthen be surrounded by the S.S., Ukrainians and Jewish groups,forced to do the dirty work.One group was called “Blue” because of the blue armbands theywore. Their job was to chase everyone out of the wagons, to discardthe baggage and carry out the dead bodies of those that hadsuffocated during their last journey.The bodies were immediately thrown into burning pits withhuman bodies that were continuously on fire. Not far away stoodanother group, referred to as “Red”, because of their red arm-128CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacybour, I can still recall his name, Piotz Supel, to help us.

His wife was in tearswhen we left. She asked that we write to them should we survive.When the war ended, I wrote to them. I received a reply in whichshe informed me that her husband and his friend perished in theMauthausen concentration camp. She was remarried to a Jewishfellow.

Kaufman, YankelEisner and Yechiel Berkowicz, Moshe Rapaport, Szimon Amster-dam and the Herman brothers. It was decided that Moshe Rapa-port, Yankel Eisner, and one of the two Herman brothers wouldbe part of a new escape attempt. Before the ‘ Appell”, all three menwent into hiding. The following day we heard nothing about theirescape. It seemed that everything had gone smoothly. We now hadto go ahead with our next plan. It was Saturday and we were pre-paring to go into hiding as well. Before the ‘Appell”, we noticedthat someone was pacing in the area where we were intending tohide. It seemed that he was looking for something. It turned outto be Kolenbrener from Czenstochova who was collaborating withthe Gestapo. We decided to postpone our plans to the followingday, Sunday. That Sunday we went to work as usual and, in theevening, again prior to the “Appell”, we went into hiding. We hadto be most careful as the Ukranians and the S.S. were on the alert.We remained in the bunker for several hours until it got very dark.We then decided to crawl out in the direction of the clinic and thewatch tower. We were now on the other side of the fence and con-tinued to crawl a few hundred meters. We then stood up and ran.We ran for hours, not knowing where we were.At 2 a.m., we heard voices in Ukrainian and it appeared that wewere in the guards’ camp. We must have been running in circlesin the darkness of the night for over five hours, covering a merekilometer. We turned in another direction and started to runagain. This time we arrived at the river Bug. We were now sixkilometers from Treblinka. It was 5 a.m., and we could see a farmhouse. Berkowicz went to the house and a few minutes later hereappeared to inform us that the entire area was surrounded bythe Gestapo. We had to leave immediately. Once again, we wereon the run.We arrived at a bridge which was the Malkin crossing. In thedistance we could see a German post on the other side of thebridge. Our decision was to remain in the field, as it was toodangerous to cross. It was 9 a.m. and we decided that we wouldremain in the field until nightfall, and then continue our escape.We asked a farmer, passing on a hay wagon, to assist us. We beg-ged him to allow us to stay on his farm. We offered him moneyand he agreed to help us. He accompanied us to the farm, the planbeing that if we were caught, he would accuse us of having brokenin.At nightfall, the Sheriff of the Village came to tell us that he wouldlead us to the highway. We walked until morning. We arrived inanother village. Along the road, we saw a woman at the door ofher house. We spoke with her, and she permitted us to stay in herhome for almost one week. After that week, she asked her neigh-126CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacywere pleased with the blanket-full of concealed loot. No report wasmade to the Germans.A week passed after that incident and there were no conse-quences. We had accumulated a large sum of money which we hid.L. Rosenthal requested half the money as he and another personfrom Warsaw were planning to escape. His companion claimed heknew of a safe way out of the camp. I informed Hershel Gk)ldsteinwho advised me, to give Rosenthal what he had requested. Thatday, I did not see Rosenthal at the ‘ Appell”, which meant that hehad escaped. Four weeks later, Kozetsky told me that Rosenthalwas back in the camp. I could hardly believe it. When I came towork (sorting “szmates”) and saw Rosenthal, I asked him whathad happened and why he was back in Treblinka. He looked atme for a brief moment and replied that he had returned in orderto show me a safer route of escape.One day, Kapo Commander Galewsky questioned Rosenthal abouthis escape. We were aware that Galewsky wished to escape. Weall were anxious to know the details of Rosenthal’s escape andreturn. He suggested that Hersh Goldstein be the next to escape,since he looked like a gentile. It appeared that Galewsky too hadnow decided to sneak out of the camp. He spoke at length withRosenthal about it. I had noticed that Rosenthal recently hadbecome quite friendly with the “Knpos” (camp police). One daythey gave him something which he immediately pocketed. In theevening after work, we did not see Rosenthal.A few days after Rosenthal’s second escape we noticed that theSS was observing our every move. Therefore, we had to be verycareful with our next escape attempt. They had learned that some-one had been smuggled into the camp and had left with a largesum of money and valuables. The commander knew all about it.He found the man and beat him viciously on head and body Wewere witnessing the scene. The commander then came over to ourgroup and pointed to Szlomo Chapnik, Hersh Goldstein, the twoFeiner brothers, two men from Piotrkov and me. We were orderedto go with the SS immediately. On the way, the Kapo Rakowskinoticed me and requested my release, because I was the barber.I was sent back to the barrack. Rakowski remembered that I hadhelped his brother to escape. The other two men were taken tothe clinic and shot.It appeared that Rosenthal had escaped again, though this timealone. Later, when I was no longer in the camp a friend fromRadomsko told me that Rosenthal was in Praga for a while. Buta few months later, he was again part of a transport of Jews tothe extermination camp of Treblinka. However, this time nobodywas selected to work in the camp. The entire transport, Rosenthalincluded, was exterminated.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy125My Escape from TreblinkaA.L. Bomba’s Story, originally written in YiddishTREBLINKA: A small village northeast ofWarsaw which was the site of a model death-camp which existed solely to put masses ofpeople to death. Its only labor was the labor ofDeath.Every person selected from a transport and ordered to workin the death camp of Treblinka, was planning to escape.This was not an easy task as you needed a lot of money, which,if found on you, would be a cause for your immediate execution.One also had to find someone whom one could trust with anescape plan.We were a group who had become very close to one another. Inour group were Hersh Goldstein, Hershel Kaufman, YankelKaufman, Yitzchak Zaidman, Yechiel Bercovitch, LeibelRosenthal, Yankel Aisner and myself. Everyone in the camp knewthat I was a barber who would sometimes cut the hair of “Kapo”Rakovski and “Kapo” Blay. Kapo Rakovski permitted me to workin the barrack, which gave me the opportunity to hide money andother valuables in preparation of the planned escape. Concealedin our blankets were our money and valuables. On the designatedday, we went into our hiding place and waited for the darknessof night. Yitzchak Zaidman led the way, followed by HershGoldstein and myself. When we were 20 meters fmm the barmck,we saw two Ukrainian guards attacking Zaidman. They beat him,unwrapped his blanket, saw the money and then talked with him.We gradually moved back in the direction of our barrack andreturned to our places. A few minutes later, the guards enteredwith Zaidman. They spoke with the barrack commander.Engineer Galewski, who ordered everyone outside. The twoUkrainians came out with Zaidman, demanding from him to pointout those who had been with him. Zaidman remained silent. Wewere then ordered back to our stations. The Ukrainians continuedspeaking with the commander. It appeared that the Ukrainians124CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyEventually, he remarried and moved across the border toGermany. One night, he had a dream. His first wife said to him:“You know that our daughter is alive and you must make anotherattempt to find her.” He awoke and decided to search once more.Leaving his pregnant wife, he returned again to Czenstochova.He begged his friend working in the city hall for help and,together, they set out in search of the child. They travelled intothe northern areas of Poland, trying to find the family who adoptedhis child. It was an extremely difficult task, but, at last, in oneof the cities, they found the family.The Polish friend went alone to meet the parents and to informthem that the real father of Maria was alive and that he wantedhis daughter back.At first the adoptive parents did not want to consider returningthe child. Little Maria was their daughter. They were a family.Many meetings and discussions followed. Promises were madeto convince the people to return Maria to her real father. Even-tually, they agreed, but they moved to another city where theywere not known, deeply saddened, and went into mourning.As for Maria, she went back to Germany with her real father. Ittook her a long time to adjust to her new family.This is a true story.Maria now lives in Israel, where she is married and has her ownfamily.Identification tag for theJewish slaves in theconcentration camp inCzens toch ova.A Jewish pohceman in theghetto.CZENSTOCHOV — Our Legacy123Little MariaBy Lucy Mietkiewicz Zilbert NiskerIn 1942, IN OUR Jewish Ghetto of Czenstochova, there was ayoung couple who had a 9-month-old baby girl. Since, by this time,most children and old people had been deported to Treblinka, theysought desperately to protect the child from the Germans.The couple, whose name will remain anonymous, convinced a localPole to escort the baby to a Polish convent, located outside theghetto. They dressed the child and placed her in a basket, witha note: Maria, 9 months old.The Polish woman took the basket with the baby to the orphanage,rang the bell, and hid nearby to see what would occur. Momentslater, a nun opened the door, saw the infant and took her inside.Months passed. The father of the child was imprisoned in thelabor camp “Hasag” in Czenstochova, while the mother perishedin the flames of the burning ghetto.In January 1945, Russian troops liberated Czenstochova fromGerman occupation. The father of Maria was fortunate to survivethe war. Having lost his wife and most of his family, his only hopenow was to be reunited with his daughter (who by this time was4 years old). He so much wanted to bring her up. As soon as hewas able, he travelled to the orphanage to meet with the MotherSuperior. When he inquired about little Maria, she told him thatshe remembered her very well. Just last year, a young childlesscouple from Warsaw came to adopt a child. They chose Maria. Hewas shocked ! Trying to be of help, the Mother Superior providedhim with their address.The very next day, he took the train to Warsaw to retrieve hisdaughter. When he arrived, he could not locate the building. Ithad been destroyed during the 1944 Warsaw uprising. There wasno trace of Maria ! Heartbroken, he returned to Czenstochova. Hetried again to locate the Polish family, with no success Months passed, but he could not find peace not knowing whetherhis child was dead or alive. Whenever he saw a little girl of Maria’sage, he looked very closely to try and recognize her.122CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyJoseph. In 1960, we made the decision to move to Canada. Manyyears of struggles and hard work allowed me to build a successfulbusiness and extend our family with two more sons; Morris andPhilip. Looking back at the difficulties I had to endure, gives mea great sense of satisfation and pride in the successes andhappiness that my family now enjoys through their careers andfamilies of their own. Of course to a very large extent, the creditfor the success in rebuilding the family and heritage I had lost,goes to my wife Laja, for without her strength, love and support,none of this could have been possible.Two BrothersBy Esther Gabel SrebrnikEvery Jew from Czenstochova who survived the war has manystories to tell. I have always wanted to share the story of two whodid not survive, my brothers Abba and Moishe Gabel. In 1943posters were put up in Czenstochova stating that a reward of 10kgof sugar would be given to those who informed the Gestapo ona Jew. Two Poles saw my brothers wandering in the forest andtold the authorities. This is how they became the victims oftreason.When I was liberated on January 16, 1945 I learned about thetragic fate of my brothers and I was desperate to exhume theirbodies. I finally had the necessary documents drawn up and thearrangements were made, but the Jewish suffering was not overyet. The Kielce Pogrom had begun. My husband Edek, myself andour one-year-old son Henry had to flee Poland immediately. Ithought my plans, to remove my brothers’ bodies from the forest,would never be realized.Throughout my life in Canada this bothered me tremendously. Ialways felt guilty about leaving them. My son Henry knew thisand when he went to Poland in 1977 his most important missionwas to find the graves of my brothers. Through sheer luck andperseverance, he found a monument to 4,000 Jews killed duringthe war and my brothers’ names were among them. Apparently,after the war a commission was formed to exhume the bodies. Inow felt as if a great weight had been lifted off my shoulders.Thanks to my son Henry, I could now live with the memory of mytwo beloved brothers.CZENSTQCHOV - Our Legacy121myself. The arrangement was that we were allowed to live there,but only as long as we did not marry The room had no bathroom,no kitchen; just four beds. We lived together in this room for sevenyears.My friends and I met a man from Czenstochover, Mr. Jutobrovski.He was a kind man, who expressed a very sincere concern for allof us, and even went along with us when we were preparing togo off to the army. At that time there had not yet been a Jewisharmy, since the English were still in control of the country. I hadthe privilege of being the three thousandth soldier to enter thearmy.When we were mobilized, there were not enough guns for all ofus. We were sent out anyway, and told that if one of the othersoldiers were injured or killed, we were to take his gun. It wasour mission to open the way to Jerusalem, which at that time wasunder Arab occupation. The commando group with which I wasmobilized was known as Palmach.I was attached to a special forces commando detachment and sentto train at a camp at Givat Olga. Here I would have the honourof having had close contacts with individuals who would later playkey roles in the successful establishment of the state of Israel.Among them, Yosef Tabenkin, Uri Banher, David Elaizer and ArielSharon. This was a turning point in my life, as for the first timeas a free man, I felt as though I could make a difference, fightingfor the rights of the Jewish people. At the outset we were 1300special forces troups, and by the time of the cease fire, our num-bers had dwindled to 350, many of whom, including myself, hadbeen injured. I spent some time in hospital, and upon my releasewas sent to train as a member of the military police, a positionwhich I held until my discharge from the army.After our tours of duty in the army my friends and I returned toour small apartment. In time my friends married, and I was left,the last one in our little apartment. I met and married my wife,but we had no means to start our life together. My wife also camefrom a poor home, which created a problem, because my mother-in-law wanted her daughter to have an easier life. However, wedecided to make a go of it anyway. I asked my landlord for per-mission to live in the apartment with my wife, until I could scrapetogether enough money to move elsewhere. He did not agree, butwe moved into that apartment anyway. One difficult test for ournew marriage was that this apartment had no conveniences at all.But with the help of our neighbours, we were soon able to over-come some of these obstacles.After some time we would move from that apartment to adifferent home and soon we welcomed the arrival of our first son120CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacyrefused to give up hope. Finally the British soldiers liberated thecamp and brought food for us. It was at this point that many diedbecause their weakened bodies could not withstand the shock ofeating after such long periods of severe starvation. My will to livewas so great that I controlled my urges to eat large amounts offood — a very difficult task, to say the least.After being liberated, I slowly regained my strength. A friend, Mr.Macovsky and I decided that we no longer wished to live in camps,and decided to find a place of our own to live. Macovsky, who wasfluent in German, would help us to pass for German Jews and thusfacilitate our ability to obtain an apartment in Germany. We wentlooking door to door for a place to live, and finally found a room.We stayed there for a while and then moved along to a small townat Saltzeim where many Jews settled temporarily while waitingfor permission to emigrate. The permission was not forthcomingand I decided that I would go to Israel illegally, if necessary. Weboarded a ship destined for Israel. All of the passengers were mak-ing similar attempts of rellocation to Israel. We were caught andplaced in an internment camp name Eilit. After two days, weescaped from the camp and attempted to enter the mainstreamof Jewish life in Israel. We were met with mixed emotions, asmany could not comprehend how we could allow ourselves to havebeen treated by the Nazis in the ways that we had been back inPoland. It became necessary for us to prove ourselves as worthyand win the compassion of those around us, making them realizethat the treatment we received at the hands of the Nazis was notour faults, but a result of circumstance.Back in Germany, I practised carpentry, which proved useful whenarriving in Israel. I met a man who was formerly from Czensto-chover and had a carpentry shop in Israel. He hired me and soonI had my first job, in the hope that I would be able to look on asthe other carpenters worked and learn the trade. As luck wouldhave it, there was no room for me to work inside the shop, so theman set me up to work outdoors. This forced me to run insideperiodically for water, but in actual fact, to allow me to look onas the others worked.My friend Efraim was living on a kibbutz. His father was acarpenter back in Czenstochover, making him a good candidatefor work in this shop. I told the owner about Efraim and he hiredhim as well. The problem was finding him a place to live. I tookhim in with me, however my landlord did not like this arrange-ment and we were forced to leave. We finally found a new placeto live. We were four men in one room. All of us were from Czen-stochov ; there was the two Lax brothers, Efraim Seltzer andCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy119was the existence of work that ensured our survival. I wasinvolved in this operation which in my case, involved destroyingthe shipping crates in which the ammunition was beingtransported. In time, the lack of crates created the need to set upa carpentry factory to build more. I was helped by three others;Itzoulek, Yescrovitch and in the carpentry shop by Bercovitch, allof whom unfortunately, did not survive the war.One particularly unpleasant recollection of the work in thefactory, involved a scenario in which a man paid off the workforeman to relieve him of the distasteful duties of cleaning theammunition casings. The foreman chose me to replace the man.After a short while on this job, without permission, I abandonedmy post. The foreman searched everywhere for me, as I did every-thing in my power to elude him. Finally he reported me to theHassack representative who later called me in to speak to him.Suspecting that I might have ties to the underground, he let meoff the hook with the warning that if this should happen againhe would be forced to deport me. It was then, by his reaction tome, that I knew that he, too, had connections to the underground.As the Russians approached the town, the Nazis decided toevacuate the factory. Some Jews hid themselves in the factory,however I chose to go with the majority. Our destination wasBuchenwald. In this camp we suffered terribly; hunger and hardlabour were very common. From there, I was deported to the con-centration camp of Dora. In this camp, the Nazis produced V2rockets. The work there was extremely grueling, working prac-tically non-stop to construct a railway, with nothing to eat exceptthe Nazis rendition of soup. In this camp, I became reunited witha childhood friend from home, Efraim Seltzer. Efraim and I stucktogether, offering encouragement and support to one another inthis terrible place we found ourselves in.With the English forcing the Nazis back, Dora too, was evacuated.People were separated according to nationality for transport inthe huge wagons. I claimed to be a non-Jew, a decision I would laterregret. The trip to Bergen Belsen was a difficult one. People werepacked into the wagons like sardines. We were not fed and manydid not survive the long trip.The war was nearing an end and at Bergen Belsen, the situationwas desperate. Food was in very short supply, and we were fed ra-tions which were impossible to survive on. In this camp I was plac-ed in barracks with many people from my hometown of Czensto-chover. The Macovskies, Hershlicovitch and others were amongthose interned with me.We were so malnutritioned that the simplest step was animpossible task. This, however, did not break my spirit and I118CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacythe Grermans, would identify Jewish children in the streets. Thesechildren would receive beatings and sometimes even more horrify-ing punishments.Soon, the Nazis evacuated the ghetto, splitting up entire families.The Germans would tell the evacuees that they were being sentto alternate locations behind the front lines, to take part in workdetails, such as potato picking. In actual fact, they were being sentto the Treblinka concentration camp. My parents’ last words to mewere that I should save myself and that I should tell anyone whowould listen of the atrocities being perpetrated against the Jewsby the Nazis. From that moment on, I realized the difficulties Iwould face as an only child, with no family, no life experience, noeducation and no trade.I was placed in a small ghetto where I lived with total strangers.The holidays were particularly painful times, wandering thestreets, looking into windows, while others attempted to celebrate.I would walk the streets, anguishing over my loss, until finallyI would tire and go home to a lonely bed. This ghetto was alsodisbanded and we were all interned and forced to work in largefactories. I was placed in an ammunition factory known as HassagPeltserie. My cousin, Hartzge Schillit was also placed in a near-by factory named Rackov.Hartzge’s brother, Herschel and his wife were being hidden outsideof the ghetto by non-Jews. Shortly before the war, Herschel triedto save his brother by approaching one of his wife’s gentile friendsin order to persuade this friend to take in Hartzge. The lady wasmost receptive and told the couple to wait while she went to getthem food for breakfast. She returned with officers of the S.S. whoproceeded to torture my cousin Herschel and force him to divulgethe name of his brother and in which factory he was working.Herschel, his wife, and Hartzge were all taken to a concentrationcamp. The wife Adella, was the only one to survive the war. Theselives were all ruined in exchange for a five-kilogram bag of sugaroffered by the Nazis for anyone willing to turn over Jews in hiding.The section in which I worked was varied in the diversity of thepeople who worked in our section would pay the Polish workersammunition from the front lines, cleaning and refurbishing it,and then returning it to the front lines for use. Some of the elderlypeople who worked in our section would pay the Polish workersto get food for them. The elders in turn would give us food toensure that we would work harder and thus spare them fromdeportation.It was common practice for the underground resistance to subvertthe German’s efforts by sabotaging different processes and thuscreating work and the need for more Jews to perform this work. ItCZENSTQCHOV - Our Legacy117those who were less fortunate. Every week before the sabbath,merchants would go through the various neighbourhoods, collect-ing food for the needy. This food would then be distributed to poorfamilies so that they too, could celebrate a joyous sabbath. Thesegestures of kindness made a tremendous impression on me andserved to rekindle in me, the belief that there still existed somesemblance of good and humanity in mankind.The town of Czenstochover was an interesting mix of extremes.One particular individual comes to mind as a symbol of the con-trasting ideals of good and evil, prevalent during those times. AJewish man, known to us as Gay la Avrum was a gentleman whomade his living in trades which were not socially or legally accept-able. As a result, he was an outcast of the Jewish community whodid not wish to be associated with his dishonest business deal-ings. This man, as ruthless as he was in his approach to business,was a totally different person in his private life. He saw to it thathis family respect all Jewish traditions and that his children beeducated and respectable. Avrum made a point of caring for oneof the town’s mentally infirm, homeless men. Every week Avrumwould take this man down to the river, bathe him, and provide himwith a fresh set of clothing. Looking back, it seems ironic thatat a time when others would turn their backs on the needy, thisman who others considered undesirable or crooked, would pro-vide aid and comfort to those who needed it the most.Eventually it came time to enter public school, where anti-Semitismwas a terrible problem. Hatred of Jewish students was so fierce,that it became necessary to segregate Jews from non-Jews inseparate schools. This did little to solve the problem of Polishchildren would look for us after school in an attempt to provokefights. In the beginning we tried to avoid them, however their per-sistence forced us to confront them against our wills. My parentswould always be very upset when I would come horn all bruisedand battered. They did not want me to fight with the non-Jewishchildren and pleaded with me to avoid these confrontations at anycost.Once the war broke out, our family attempted to flee the Germanoccupation, but eventually we were held up in a small town andwere forced to return home. The Nazis began selecting Jews forseveral different types of work which they wanted carried out. Itried to avoid becoming involved in their various work projects,but this was not always possible.The Nazis constructed a ghetto and took away all of our meansof supporting ourselves. Eventually hunger would set in, forcingme to sneak out of the ghetto to stand in the Polish food lines forbread. Some of my friends who did likewise, were not as fortunateas I, and were picked out of the lines by Poles who, working with116CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacyworn out shoes would always serve as a symbolic lesson to meabout the cold harshness of growing up poor and Jewish in a worldthat tolerated neither.My parents, though not extremely religious, kept a strictly kosherhome. Often in my childhood, situations in the outside worldwould demonstrate to me the total disregard and disrespect ofJewish culture and tradition, held by the non-Jews of Czensto-chover. One particularly disturbing recollection is of a man whowatched over the building in which my family lived. One day, Isaw this man, sitting outside, eating a ham sandwich. The mancalled me over and asked me if I was familiar with the type of meatthat he was eating. When I said that I was not, he held down myarms and rubbed a slice of ham all over my face and mouth. Itis a taste I have never been able to rid myself of to this very day.Our town was predominantly anti-Semitic, whose majority wouldseek out any opportunity to harass and terrorize the Jews of thisfairly large Polish town. Very often, the Jewish community wouldbe under siege by groups of youths and adults, intent on damag-ing Jewish property, as well as inflicting bodily harm. A smallgroup of Jewish townspeople would undertake a modest resis-tance effort to combat the violence and terror. In one unfortunateconfrontation, one of the non-Jewish pillagers was killed. Hisdeath would serve to create a martyr for the anti-Semitic factionsand give them further cause to make the Jews of Czenstochoverthe focus of continued pogroms and violence.The Poles were extremely harsh in their attitude towards the Jews.Often, in organized groups, the Polish townspeople would picketin front of Jewish businesses, discouraging customers from buy-ing their goods. These tactics made it difficult, if not impossiblefor the Jews to earn a living.The hatred toward Jews only made us stronger in our resolve; theinstinct to survive was greater than our complacency to succumbto this overt discrimination. As a child I can remember taking partin the efforts to resist the campaigns against the Jewish sectorsof town. We build walls and barricades to help prevent our enemiesfrom perpetrating their evil deeds upon us. Growing up in thesecircumstances, it became painfully obvious that only the strongcould survive. Not a very cheerful lesson for a young boy, but onethat encouraged youth to adopt a fighting mentality at a very earlyage - there was little choice in the matter.The town’s Jewish community was made up of three classes — thepoor, an entrepreneurial middle class, and the well-off. At alltimes, the Jews of Czenstochover exhibited a sense of responsi-bility to their own. One found childhood memory if of the gene-rosity shown by many of the fortunate Jewish town’s folk in aidingCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy115A Lost ChildhoodBy Szlomo SzwimerMy earliest childhood memories are of the times as a youth inschool. It was an old schoolhouse, maintained through thegenerosity of the Jewish community of the town. The impoverish-ed children of our community went to this school, while others,more well off, went to private schools run by rabbis. The schoolhad approximately 150 students.The school was adjacent to a river. This river was bordered on onebank by a Jewish neighbourhood, and by a Jewish hospital on theother. The sounds of the rolling river were a big part of our dayin school, as the water rushed outside of the windows, and aftera long day in classes, I often went down to the river to swim. Thiswas a place where my friends and I would go to forget the harshrealities of religious segregation. Playing with friends and enjoy-ing childhood activities allows us to, for a short while, forget thehatred which often surrounded all Jewish children, even withinthe security of one’s own home town.Beyond the bank where the hospital stood, was a gentile neigh-bourhood. The non-Jewish children would regularly interrupt ourswimming by hurling stones at us. We barely had time to get outof the water and defend ourselves. I remember vividly, the manytimes I would go home bloodied as a result of the stonings I receiv-ed at the hands of our non-Jewish neighbours. Fbr fear that myparents would not allow me to return to the river, I felt compelledto invent creative stories in order to explain my dishevelled con-dition upon arriving home.Eventually, the truth did come out, and my parents forbid fromplaying by the river after school. From that time on, my after-noons were spent in the relative safety of my own backyard, play-ing soccer, with a ball fashioned from old socks. The new shoesI would receive at Passover would inevitably be worn out in a mat-ter of a few short days as result of the wear and tear of our dailysoccer matches. The realities of poverty would require me to walkaround for the rest of the year in torn and tattered shoes. These114CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legcacyafter a day of fasting and prayers to the Almighty to grant eachand everyone a year of life, all the street lights were put on. ThepurpKDse was to make sure that no Jew sould be able to run awayto the Aryan side of the ghetto walls. The Jewish ghetto policewere running from house to house telling everyone that they hadto be present at the ‘Appell”, which took place on the “NewMarket’’. There they selected those chosen for deportation to thegas chambers of Treblinka. I did not go to the “Appell’’. I took mymother and my sisters to a hiding place in a bunker at the BralandFactory, under a barrage of gunfire. Sixty people were hiding inthis bunker.The Nazi Commander, Degenhart, demanded that the Landaubrothers turn in those who were hiding in their factory. Hethreatened that if they found the hiding place, everyone would beshot. That bunker was not discovered, the Landau brothers werenot killed.I had an identification card from “Enro’’. I went from Landau’sfactory to the “Metalurgia’’, where a large group had gathered.The Director of “Enro’’ company told us to go with him and pre-sent our working permit from “Enro’’. On the way to theMetalurgia, the guard gave a signal to the Nazi Degenhart whothen asked the age of a young boy in our group. In his panic, theboy could not talk. His father, Szmuel Zelinger, answered for himand said he was 17 years old, but the guard, Szol, took him outof our group and killed him with his revolver right in front of us.That was the first time in my life that I saw a person killed. I willnever forget that horrible scene as long as I live. That tragic YomKippur of 1942 marked the beginning of all deportations and themurder of my beloved family — my father, Chaim, my mother,Dvora, and my sisters, Sara and Miriam.Inside the HASAG Concentration CampCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy113The Tragic Yom Kippurof 1942Orig^ally written in Yiddish by Moshe AltmanIt was a few days before Yom Kippur of 1942. Alter Altman wasan electronic technician and the Brigadier of the “Enra” Co., whoworked in the company as a slave laborer. I had a special permitfrom the company, but I have always found ways not to go to work.The Brigadier warned me that recently the management was verystrict with those who were not present at work all the time. Theworking permit was a guarantee of security and it could be takenaway at any time.One day Alter Altman told me that he had just come out of theadministration office and that there was bad news for all thosein the ghetto. He was told, in confidence, that the murderous“deportation commando” had arrived in Czenstochov and 100cattle box cars were on the train, ready to be used for the depor-tation of the Czenstochova Jews from the large ghetto.Upon hearing the shocking news, I called a few of my friends,Yeheskel Of man, Friedman and Zborovski. We all decided that wehad to return to the ghetto to warn everyone so that they had theopportunity to do everything possible to save themselves fromdeportation. I also told my brothers, Todel and Tovieh and DavidKozak.At first, everyone thought this story was exaggerated, but others,from different working places, confirmed its authenticity. Weasked ourselves what we could do. But no one knew the answer.The Jews who were in their hiding places thought that in a fewdays everything would be over. That did not happen. The Naziswere searching everywhere for those in hiding. Whoever wasfound was immediately shot. It was shameful that the Jewishghetto police collaborated with the Commandos in the search andturned the people over to the Nazis.At that time, the war between the Germans and the Russians wascontinuing. All the windows had to be covered at night. The samelaw applied for the street lights; but, on that Yom Kippur night.112CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leff&cyThe Holocaust was different from all other earher massacers inthe history of the Jewish people because of its conscious planningand systematic execution.Death is always tragic, but when death by murder is multipliedby six million in five years (counting only the Jewish victims), anew term had to be coined for it: Genocide. And the conscienceof the world seemed mute. A great transformation has taken placein the lives of the Jewish people. We are no longer the victims ofrulers in one country or another. We have become masters of ourown destiny in our own land — Israel.I presently reside in Chicago and have one son and one daughterand two grandchildren. I am also the President of the MidwestCzenstochover Society. I am happy at last.In December 1939 the Germanauthorities ordered all Jews to wearat all times an armband with a largeStar of David.PHOTO BY ILUSTR. “POLISH JEWS”CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy111My Story of SurvivalBy Barbara PryorMy name is Barbara Pryor, born Basia Zielonka. I am marriedto Jerry Pryor, formerly Jurek Przyrowski.I lived in Czenstochova on the famous Garibaldi Street. It was ahome between the mikva and the synagogue, the town’s mostbeautiful. As I witnessed the burning of the synagogue by theNazis, I was sure that the flames would reach heaven.My family consisted of my beloved parents, six sisters andbrothers, and eight nieces and nephews. Both of my parents alsocame from large families.On September of 1939, the Germans overran Poland and the massslaughter of Jews began, as did the nightmare of the deportationtrains, extermination camps and various other bestial atrocitiesperpetrated by the Germans. Their “final solution’’ took away myentire family.How did I survive ? This episode of my survival is one of manymiracles. One day we were all rounded up on the square, next tothe small ghetto for another selection from people who allbelonged to various working groups. I slipped into one group butwas pushed out by a Jewish policeman because “I didn’t belongthere’’. My sister saw my dilemma and signalled to me to quicklymove into her group. At that moment, a miracle happened: Thegroup I was taken out of was sent away for deportation. Nobodysurvived. On this unforgettable Bloody Monday, a few heroicJewish partisans attempted to kill the Germans, among them alieutenant Rohn. This caused havoc among the Germans. Theyresponded by massacering more Jews in revenge. They then tooktruckloads of Jews to the cemetery to face a German firing squad.The tragedy was indescribable. I survived Bloody Monday. Later,I was taken to the Hasag concentration camp in Czenstochova.The small ghetto was burned to the ground, with mothers holdingtheir babies in their arms, old people hidden in the houses. Thiswas just one episode in my miraculous survival story.110CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyIn May 1941, an order was given forcing all the Jewish people tolive in a ghetto situated in the impoverished part of the city. Lifein the ghetto was intolerable. Ten to twelve people were crowdedinto one room, without water, toilet or food.In September 1942, rumors spread that the ghetto was going tobe liquidated. On the day of Yom Kippur, September 21, Germansdressed in black uniforms arrived in the city together with Ukra-nians. Many cattle cars could be seen at the train station. At 4 a.m.on September 22, the Germans and Ukranians attacked a fewstreets in the ghetto and chased everyone from their homes. Thosewho did not move quickly were killed on the spot.I was in the first group, along with my wife, our 4-week-old child,my mother and brother. We were chased by police to walk quicklyin the direction of the train station where over 60 cattle cars wereready to be loaded. Five thousand people were loaded into the trainthat tragic day after Yom Kippur — the first transport toTreblinka. My family and I, however, were told, along with someof the others, to return to our homes. But I never saw my brother,his pregnant wife and their 3 year old son again.On September 25th, a day before Sukkot, we were taken back toBerka Joselewicza Street. A few more people were taken out ofthe group. The rest were sent back to the station. We were push-ed into the wagons and piled on top of one another. After severalhours waiting, the train started rolling. The wagon was filled withabout 120 to 140 persons, without food, water or room to breathe.The train was headed in the direction of Warsaw. After travellingall night, we arrived the following morning at a small station —Treblinka.I was standing near the window watching one train roll in whileanother one left, empty. Ours was the third train entering Tre-blinka. It was 12 noon.Orders were given immediately as we rolled into the camp. Womenand children were ordered to go inside the barracks, while the menwere to stand outside. They were made to undress completely andto get ready to go to the shower room. Nobody knew that thesewere the gas chambers. On that day, between 16-18,000 Jewishpeople arrived at the camp. All were gassed within a couple ofhours.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Le,109My HometownCzenstochovBy A. BombaFirst let me say many thanks to my friend Harry Klein for thehard work he has put into compiling a book in English about ourcity Czenstochova, for the second generation. Many books havebeen written in various languages, but this book is about thehistory of our city It will be unique as it describes the life of avibrant pre-war Czenstochova which ceased to exist as we onceknew it.Jews have inhabited the city of Czenstochova for many hundredsof years. They have enriched the city by building hospitals, fac-tories, banks, clubs, political parties, congregations and welfareinstitutions. We were, nonetheless, strangers in our own land andin our own city because we were Jewish and were not acceptedby most of the Polish people who were anti-Semites.In the thirties, the ruling party of the country created new lawsagainst the Jewish population. There were anti-Semitic outbreaksagainst Jewish students in the Universities; the Poles wereorganized to boycott Jewish merchants. This mistreattnent con-tinued with pogroms in 1937, led by Kluzniak and in 1938, ledby Baron. The abuse of Jewish people continued until 1939 andthe outbreak of the second world war.On the second day of the war, the Germans entered our city andtwo days later, on September 4th, without any provocation, theGermans started to attack the entire population of Czenstochova.Many people were killed.In December, 1939, the Jewish population was ordered to weararm bands with the Star of David. All the Jewish-owned stores,businesses and factories were confiscated. This was followed byan order that Jews must give up all such possessions as fur coats,radios and furniture. Every few days the Germans attackedJewish homes and took the men and women to do forced labour.Many Jewish people were never returned to their homes.108CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacyof tradition and respect for their roots. This is reinforced everyShabbat when we travel, en masse, to Buby and Zaidy’s for din-ner. The conversation is noisy, the kids run around. Somethingalways gets spilled, but you will not find a more loving atmosphereor “hamische” feeling than around the Skovronek family tableon Friday nights.V;c' h\\\' ^The living quarters (barracks) in theHASAG forced-labour camp.A section of the small ghettoCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy107day of Pesach. The police came to the house looking for him andwhen they couldn’t find him, they arrested his youngest sister.When our father found out about this, he surrendered to the policeand his sister was allowed to go home. He was kept in a hall over-night. The next day, the family was allowed to say goodbye. Whenhis father walked into the room, he was hardly recognizable. Hiseyes were red and swollen with tears, and his hair had turnedwhite overnight. He squeezed our father’s hand and said, ‘T donot believe that we will see each other again”. About six weekslater, around Shavuot, the Germans scooped up the remainingJews of Krzepic, and sent them to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.Included were 28 members of our family - uncles, aunts, cousinsand our 83 year old great-grandmother.Our father spent the next three years in a variety of differentconcentration camps, including Niederkirch, Markstadt, Fiinf-teichen, Grossrosen, Flossenberg, Dresden and, finally, There-sienstadt. He lived under conditions that we, of today’s genera-tion, cannot possibly fathom. He was finally liberated when theRussians marched into Theresienstadt. He was weak and weighedapproximately 90 pounds; but he gathered all his strength andwent back to Chenstochova where he found two cousins, Sara andSam Wien. He then travelled to his home town in the hope of find-ing more relatives. But they had all perished. He then returnedto Germany and there found out that his youngest sister, Lily, hadsurvived and was in Sweden. Through her he received the sadnews that his sister. Rose, had died in Bergen Belsen. At the sametime, he learned that his sister, Beatrice, who had left Krzepic justbefore the war, was married in New York to a man namedWeisbrot.Our father, along with the other survivors, never gave up hope.It kept them alive and it allowed them to move on to a new world.For our Dad, this new world was Canada. He learned a newlanguage and rebuilt his life. He married our mother shortly aftermoving to Toronto and, for over 40 years, they have had a strong,loving marriage.Our father became a successful builder, although he would be thefirst to tell you a man’s success is not measured by his pocket-book, but by his honour and integrity. He has always been activein the Jewish community. He is President of the ChenstochoverAid Society and has worked tirelessly for Israel. Zionism and thesurvival of Israel is always at the forefront of his thoughts, secondonly to his family. In June of 1989, he was instrumental inorganizing a home-town reunion in Israel. People got togetherwho had not seen each other in over 40 years. It was a tearful,joyful occasion.We are now grown up and have lives of our own; but we carry withus the history of our ancestors as told to us by our Dad. We willretell these stories to our children, so they may also have a sense106CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe Skovronek FamilyThroughout our childhood, we were regaled by stories of“Krzepic”. We heard of the small 2-room house our father, PhilipSkovronek, lived in with his parents and 3 sisters. In the sum-mer our father slept in the kitchen, and the rest of the family sleptin a little larger room which contained two beds, a table, somechairs, a credenza and a clothes closet. This room was heated bya ceramic-tile oven from floor to ceiling. In the winter this ovenwas used to heat the room, as well as for cooking. When it wasvery cold our father moved into this room with the rest of the fami-ly for the warmth of the stove. He awoke to the frost caked on thewindows. Running to the outhouse on cold winter nights wasanother story we heard about often. Our father attended publicschool from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and, after lunch, he would go to“Cheydar” until 7 or 8 p.m. In the winter, when the days wereshort, it was very dark at that hour. Our great-grandfather livedclose to “Cheydar”, so the first stop on the way home was to ourfather’s maternal grandfather. When our father complained thathe was afraid to go home in the dark, our great-grandfather gavehim this sound advice: “Go home and tell your father to come andget you”.It is so important for all these stories to be handed down throughthe generations. Particularly because we never knew these peo-ple, who all were killed in the Holocaust; but, through thesestories, they come alive for us and we cherish their memories.At the age of 17 our father left home to earn a living, while hisfamily remained in Krzepic. For holidays, he used to travel homefrom Chenstochova. When the war broke out, on September 1,1939, he was at home with his family. He spent the next threeyears at home, being dragged out to do work that included clean-ing a horse stable with bare hands, lining up boulders on a road(for no reason) and digging up potatoes in the field. Periodicallythe SS would come to the town and arrest able-bodied Jews andsend them to work in concentration camps. Our father used tohide at his gentile neighbours until the Germans left town. In thisway, he managed to stay home until April 10, 1942. It was the lastCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy105His funeral was the first that I ever attended. The blackmailersoon vanished, and I suspected that the partisans “took care” ofhim.At the end of 1944, Czenstochova became a bombing target forthe advancing Russian army, and Rakow in particular, becauseof the foundry. Irena sent me to relatives a few miles away. Sud-denly on the 17th of January 1945, all the bombing stopped. Thenext day, I was taken back to the apartment, and found BOTHmy parents there! You can imagine my surprise!My parents found a place to live in Czenstochova, with Ted andDora Zylberszac, and their niece, Lucy, whose parents and brotherperished during the war. As most of Poland was still at war, wehad to remain there for some time.We did return to Katowice, where my parents took repossessionof their old embroidery business. I enrolled in a local school, andas I was used to the name Pabinska, my parents registered meas Lucyna Fabinska, to keep the initial “F” in the surname. Latermy parents, also, officially changed their name. We moved toAustralia in May 1949, to join my uncle who had moved there oneyear earlier. We lived in Melbourne. I was sent to a boarding schoolto learn English and so that my parents could establish them-selves in business without having to care for a 13 year old child.I went on to study pharmacy. On March 15, 1959, I marriedDr. Michael Bergman. We have one daughter, Suzanne, and twosons, David and Jonathan, as well as two grandchildren.Jewish police station in the small ghettoThe large ghetto in ruinswas the only person in Rakow who kjiew the truth about me. Andwhen the Gestap)0 came, usually at night, to search for partisans,I was locked in the toilet until it was safe to come out. That toiletbecame like a second home to me.At the beginning of my stay with Irena, she would take me, oncea month, on an early morning train ride to Czenstochova, wherewe would stand on a certain street corner, wait for a column ofmarchers. Irena did this to reassure them that I was safe. ThenIrena stopped taking me. My parents had sent a message that so-meone had recognized me and they feared that I might be de-nounced. I did not see my parents again, until two years later, theday after we were liberated.While living in Rakow, I lived as normal a life as possible. I wentto school, went skating and tobogganing. We lined up for food ra-tions, and raised pigs. However, in Poland, Catholic children havetheir First Communion between the ages of six and eight. Thismeant that to keep my cover, I would have to be confirmed. ButIrena had promised my parents that she would do everything inher power to prevent me having to be confirmed. Although I wentto all the classes, and learned all the material required, I foundsome excuse for my not participating. Usually I was sick or sentaway so it would not look so obvious. Finally, when it became toodangerous for me to remain in Rakow, because the town was fre-quently being searched for partisans. I was, ironically, sent to livewith Natala and her SS officer. We told him that I was Natala’slittle sister and we told our Rakow neighbors that I had had myconfirmation while I was staying with Natala. During the fewweeks that I lived with Natala, I ate the best food that I had eatenduring the entire war.Two notable incidents took place while I lived in Rakow. First, anew tenant moved into our building. She was about my mother’sage and seemed very nice. One day she cornered me, and said“I know who you are”. I thought that was the end of me. Sheidentified me as Lucyna Fajgenblat, since she had known myparents. She told me that my secret was safe with her, as she toowas living a lie, as a widow, hiding her Jewish husband in thecountryside.The second incident had a more profound effect on me. One dayI saw a big crowd gathered on the street nearby. I moved to thefront of the crowd, only to witness a Jew shot dead, only twometers from me.In 1943, Stan Kaczmarczyk became very ill with tuberculosis. Acousin of his, from the country, visited Rakow. He knew that therewas no such person as Lucyna Pabinska, and he blackmailed thefamily for all the money that they could have used to save Stan.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Le/sr^103old and obviously not able to work, I was of no value to theGermans. My days were spent locked in our room, in silence.No one was to know of my existence. If I heard a noise outsidethe door, I would quickly and quietly climb into a large wickerbasket, filled with clothing.In Hasag there also worked Poles. One day a Pole came up andleft a small parcel near my parents, when the Germans were notlooking. When they opened it at night, they found a small cookedchicken, with a letter in the core. It was from Irena Kaczmarczyk.She wrote that if my parents received the chicken, that the con-tact was safe.She had organized things from her end, along with the plans fortaking me out of the ghetto. The Pole carried messages backand forth at great risk to his own life, and my parents wouldalways get a chicken ! In case he were caught, he could claim thechicken was his lunch. Towards the end of 1942, it was arrangedthat I be passed over to Irena. On THE day, a tall thin man cameearly in the day to our room. He strapped me to his chest, and wentstraight to a pre-selected out-house, where he left me in the smellytoilet, under a plank of wood. At nightfall, my father took me tothe fence of the ghetto, made a hole and pushed me through. Awoman was waiting for me, but I did not know her. I was scared.She told me that I was to stay with her for a few days, until Irenacould come and take me to Rakow. I spent a lot of time hiddenunder her bed.Irena came and took me home to her husband, StanislawKaczmarczyk, and their two daughters, Stanislawa (then 12) andTbresa (then 9). I was 6 years old. Also, part of the family wereIrena’s niece and nephew, children of Stanislaw and his first wife,Irena’s late sister. They were adults already and were hiding withthe partisans. Furthermore, Natala was the mistress of an SS of-ficer. All the information that she gathered, she passed on to herbrother, Jurek. Life with the Kaczmarczyk family was like sittingon a time bomb.Conditions were better for us than for most, since Stanislaw hada job in the foundry. This gave him some privileges, such as ac-cess to a private toilet, ownership of a small shed for the pig thatthey raised for food, and access to a hot shower in the foundryonce a week. At other times, we all washed in the kitchen basin.I had two identities, depending on the circumstances. To all theneighbors, I was Lucyna Pabinska, a niece, daughter of Irena’sbrother, a widower who could not look after me. But, during a Ger-man search, I became “Terenia’, and the real Terenia went to aneighbor and became her granddaughter, who was about thesame age, but lived in Czenstochova. This lovely woman, Irena,102CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacySoon after we moved into the compound, my mother’s brother,Adam, and his wife arrived from Lvov and joined us. Althoughhe was a bacteriologist, he pretended to be an embroiderer so hecould stay with our family and would not be sent to the ghetto.Also with us was my father’s brother, Heniek, and my paternalgrandparents. The rest of the family was confined to the ghetto,except my uncle, Stasiek, who was trapped in Russia.With the work that the families did in this compound, they couldearn money and we led a nearly normal life, considering the cir-cumstances. There were even weddings and parties amongfriends in the apartments. This situation lasted for about a year.Suddenly, one day, while we still lived in these apartments, theGestapo arrived and ordered all the old people and those not ableto work to assemble in the courtyard. Those “selected” were toldto bring a bag with some clothing, and enough food for two days.They were to be “resettled” on farm “for an easier life”. I remem-ber being sent back to our apartment to get a blanket for mygrandparents who were the “lucky ones” to be selected for reset-tlement. I also brought them some sugar, in case they were ableto get some tea on their journey. That was the last we ever sawof Mordechai and Miriam Fajgenblat. Sometime later, we learnedthat they were taken directly to Majdanek and killed. At aboutthe same time, my mother stopped receiving letters from herparents in Sosnowiec. Later, when we were in the ghetto, some-one from Sosnowiec told my mother that Isidor and RoginaLevenhof went in a similar “selection” and were killed inTreblinka.Shortly after that, a childhood friend of my father appeared oneday, posing as a customer. Her name was Irena Kaczmarczyk. Fbra large fee, she was willing to hide my parents, but we had nomoney since all our worldly possessions were left behind inKatowice. Nevertheless, she agreed to take me into her care,although I was not aware of it at that time. She began by takingme for walks out of the compound, so as to test ways of removingme permanently. Suddenly, we were told that the compound wasto be closed immediately, and all residents moved to the ghetto.New plans had to be made.My parents found accommodation in the same block as theKopinski and Zylberszac families. Tadek Zylberszac was marriedto Dora Kopinski. His brother, Gutek, and wife, Anka, were alsoin the ghetto. They had a daughter, Stefa, who, during the war,was hidden in a convent.All the adults in the ghetto who were able to work, marched eachmorning to an ammunitions factory, called Hasag, a few kilo-meters away. It became very dangerous for me. I was only six yearsCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy101The Wartime Experiencesof Lucia Bergman (nee Eajgenblat)My name is Lucia Bergman, but when I was born on April 17th,1936,1 was Ludwiga Fajgenblat.

All of them wereembroiderers.i was only three years old when the war broke out.In Poland, the 1st of September was a public holiday. In 1939, myparents travelled to Czenstochova to visit my grandparents, and1 stayed with my maternal grandparents in Sosnowiec. Wlien warvas declared, my parents became stranded in Czenstochova withonly two days’ supply of clothing. As Jews were banned frc»m fur-ther travel, I could not be reunited with my mother and father un-til a year later, when they arranged for a Christian friend to bringme to Czenstochova, using his daughter’s identity papers.When I arrived in Czenstochova in 1940, Jews were still allowedto live in their own homes, but this was changing quickly. TheJewish quarter was walled in and all Jews were required to moveinto “the ghetto’’. A selection of families including our family, allof whom were tradesmen (i.e.: tailors, milliners, jewellers, em-broiderers, etc), were ordered to move into three apartment blocks,built in a “U’-shape around a courtyard. On the fourth side, therewas a high fence and gate leading to the outside world. Thisbuilding was on the main street of Czenstochova, and the Jewswithin were not allowed to exit but the Christians from the towncould enter and utilize the services of the residents. The Germans,of course, could get all their services from the residents.100CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacybe allowed to return to work. Standing next to my aunt, theGerman officer pushed me to one group and ordered my aunt togo to the other side. My group was soon to be sent to Trebliiika.My aunt and uncle were ordered back to work. They were licanbroken, not knowing how they would face my parents and lellthem that I had been taken away by the Germans.Suddenly, a miracle occurred ! I was released from the gmup anda few minutes later, joined my aunt at work. She was overjoyedto see me, crying and laughing at the same time. She was thrilledto be able to return me to my parents.However, while we were at work, there was a big “selection” atthe factory, “Metalurgia”, on Garibaldi Street. My parents and mybrother were among a large group taken away. That morning wasthe last time I saw my parents and my brother alive, as well asmy best friend whom I knew since I had been 2 years old.I am the only survivor of my class, which consisted of 23 children.THE HOLOCAUSTMillions of People never got a chanceChildren's lives never got to advance.So many children with so many dreamsMost of them never grew up to be in their teens.People running away, people in hiding,But disaster they would definitely be finding.But what was the cause of all this mess?What was the reason of all this distress?It was because the Jews were differentAnd proud of it too.And the Germans thought everyone should be like themEven if it wasn't true.In the end, 6,000,000 were gone.But there was still some hope that shone.Because three years after it was finishedThe State of Israel was bornUntil this day this tragedy we mourn.MELANIE TAKEFMAN(Age: 11)CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy99My ChildhoodBy Lucy Mietkiewicz Zilbert NiskerI WAS 10 YEARS OLD when the war broke out on September 1, 1939.A few days later, German troops marched into Czenstochova, andmy entire world changed.The first orders were for everyone to give up their radios, anddeliver them to a central depot. This cut our contact with the out-side world. The major change for me, however, was that I nolonger was able to go to Jewish Day School. Jewish children weredenied access to all educational facilities. My parents discussedthe situation with others, and within a few months, small tutorialgroups were illegally organized in private homes by two sisters.Riba and Madzia Horowicz. Every day these groups met to teachthe children lessons on different subjects. To insure our secrecy,we changed locations frequently.In 1940, life became more difficult. All Jews, 13 years and older,were ordered to wear the armband with the Star of David. I wasnot yet old enough to receive this honor.September, 1942, brought deportations to Czenstochova. One dayafter Yom Kippur, everyone was put under “house arrest”. Severaldays later, we learned that my grandparents Mietkiewicz, twouncles and four aunts were among the first groups shipped toTreblinka.Shortly thereafter, my parents and brother and myself weretransported to a huge factory called “Metalurgia”. We were con-sidered fortunate to be placed there, and told we were immunefrom deportation.On October 5, 1942, Simha Torah, I bid my parents good-bye andwas sent to liquidate apartments abandoned by Jewish families,in an area which was later to be the “small ghetto”. The task wasemotionally draining, as often we would find food on the table,which meant that the family was forced to leave suddenly. On thatday, the Germans arrived while we were working. Everyone wasordered out into the street. They inspected all of us and dividedus into two groups. One group was to be sent away, the other to98CZENSTOCHOV— Ourwas unable to walk any longer and sat down, was shot in the head.For this poor soul the torture and pain were over.In spite of the heavy “SS” security and continuous shootings,many of the marchers were able to escape to the forest.When we reached the horrible camp Gardelegen, only one hundredand fifty souls remained alive. Half an hour before we arrived, the“SS” searched the forest to recapture some of the people who hadmanaged to escape. All were captured and driven to Gardelegen,where they were gathered into a shack and burned alive.The world knew only much later, that on April 12th, 1945, threedays before the liberation by the American army, 1,015 people,martyrs of many nationalities, had perished.The victorious American army ordered the Mayor of Gardelegento prepare a special place in the cemetery for the memory of theburned martyrs. Gardelegen has a cemetery where there are1,015 special graves that symbolize the brutality of the Naziregime.As one of the 68 people who survived the “Dead March” I pay myrespect to those who perished. It is a tragedy I can never forget.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy97From Rotleberade to GardelegenTo the Memory of my friends who perished in the HolocaustOriginally written in Yiddishby Harry RosenblnmI WAS BORN IN CzENSTOCHOVA AFTER the liquidation of the largeghetto, I was placed in HASAG Pelcern, a forced labor camp inCzenstochova. On January 15, 1945, I was deported to Buchen-wald and later to Dora; from there again to Rotleberade. This wasthe last stage of my painful experiences of horror during the“March of the Dead”, a march from the concentration camp Rotle-bemde to Gardelegen.This camp was located in Germany. It employed over 1,000 slaveworkers of all nationalities, used in the production of missiles forthe Nazi war machine.On Wednesday, April 5, 1945 the camp was evacuated and we wereforced to march again. From far away Nordhausen we saw thefires caused by the air attacks by the Allied forces. Under horribleand inhuman conditions, harassed by terrible beatings, we wereall driven at night to the tio,in station. At the same time, all theinmates of other camps in the same area werc evacuated. Tbgetherwe numbered over 8,000 people.We were surrounded by “SS” troops who proceeded to push over100 people into each of many cattle cars. The transport lastedseven days and nights. No one received food or water and as alosult many died. Each day the train stopped and the corpses wercthrown out of the cattle wagons. On the seventh day the trainstopped completely because there was no more rail connection.The transportation system had been bombed into total collapse.Now the “SS” guards ordered everyone out of the wagons to lineup and be counted. Only 2,000 out of the 8,000 had survived.Under heavy “SS” guard, we were forced to start marching onceagain on a narrow road towarxis a forest. Two thousand livingskeletons marched, not knowing their destination. Anyone who96CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacythe letter “K”: Kohn, Kleiner, Konsens and Krakowski, so wewere all tatooed with numbers in sequence on our arms. Threeof us survived to the end of the war. Kohn in the United States, Kleinin Canada, Krakowski in Israel. Unfortunately, Konsens didn’tmake it. He gave up. I tried to encourage him as much as I could,but only a few months before the end of the war, he was killedby the SS.Later I was in Birkenau-Auschwitz, where I was put on the detailof digging ditches with a group of about 20 people. During ourlunch time, dining on watery soup, we talked with people fromdifferent places. Somebody asked me where I was from, and Imentioned Czenstochova. A couple of men got up and told meabout their experience in Czenstochova, and how, when they werepassing by in a train, a young fellow with a red armband fromRawo, gave them water. When I heard that, I jumped and took upthe story where they left off. That was a most unusual reunion.From that moment until today, I can still hear the crying andscreaming from that boxcar. When the train started moving, Iheard their cries: “Don’t forget us! Avenge our souls! Say Kaddishfor our families!’’Loading the cattle cars.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy95through the small open window. I ran back a few times to refillthe watercans, giving the water mostly to the women withchildren. I told them, “I don’t want anything because I am a Jewmyself.” They started asking me: “Where are we going?”, “Whatare they going to do to us?” I knew that these transports weregoing to Treblinka - a death camp — but seeing those helplessmothers with children, I did not have the heart to tell them.When I moved on to the next wagon, which was full of young men,I told them the truth and told them they had nothing to lose bybreaking out while the train was moving. Each time, I was run-ning with the water, I was constantly chased and threatened bythe S.S. guards, who were pointing their rifles at me. When thetrain started moving, I heard screaming voices: “Don’t forget us!Avenge our souls! Say Kaddish for our families!”Finally, I was chased back to work, and in the evening we wereescorted back to the ghetto. The next day when I got back to work,I had a chance to speak to some Polish people who worked near-by on the railroad and who lived in the area. They told me thatthe night before there had been a lot of shooting and someprisoners had escaped from moving trains. The Germans werechecking out the entire area, I was told.I worked there a few days. After being transferred to work in manydifferent places, I found a way to return to the ghetto. But severalmonths later, I was caught and sent to the concentration campat Blizin, which was a terrible camp for hard labor and execu-tions by the stonefaced S.S. Sturmfiihrer Nell. There I met mybuddy from back home, Harszel Kleiner (now Harry Klein ofMontreal, Canada). We went through a living hell.I happened to have a good working position in a warehouse; wewere able to help each other. First, Harszel got infected withtyphus fever, and I was able to bring him soup. Then, I was sickwith typhus and Harszel was there helping me.Then we were shipped in cattle cars to Birkenau-Auschwitz. Wearrived at night and were waiting by the gas chambers and cre-matoriums until daylight. The SS men in charge were sleepingafter a drinking party. While we were waiting, my buddy, Harszel,found out that his sister-in-law was working in the “Sonderco-mando’ ’ behind the electric fence. They exchanged words throughthe fence in the dark. In the morning, the SS Stormfiihrersarrived and the selection started “to left to right”. By somemiracle, we were spared. While waiting, we could see the flamesfrom the crematoriums reaching up to the sky, and could smell thestench of human flesh.By then we had met two other friends and the four of us kepttogether. By a coincidence, all four of our last names started with94CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacySamuel Kohn Tells His StoryBy Samuel (Szmulek) KohnSAMUEL (SZMULEK) KOHN was born in Czestochowa, son of Jacob and SaraGenieslaw.Both parents and two sisters, Renia and Rachel (and her two-yeai'-old daughterMarylka), perished in the Holocaust in Treblinka.Sam was confined in several ghettos and later deported to the concenti'amp camp,Blizin. From there, he was taken to numerous different camps and then toAuschwitz. He was finally liberated by the American Army in Seshaupt, nearMunich, Germany, on May 5, 1945. He came to New Haven, Connecticut, in Aprilof 1951.In 1953, Sam met Celina Markowicz, who had been born in Boleslawiec, Poland,near Czestochowa. She survived the war by passing as a Catholic child on a farmwith a Polish family. Sam and Celina were married in June, 1953. The Kohns havetwo children: Jeff, who owns the Jeff Martin Fitness Studio in New York City, andSharon Jacobs, who is at Temple University School of Medicine and the Directorof HSC Project Management in Philadelphia. Her husband, David, is a vice presi-dent at Citicorp. They have a daughter, Jennifer Laura.In October of 1942, after the “selection” by the German S.S.murderer, Degenhart, I was taken away from my family andwound up in the “small ghetto”.There is one incident that will stand out in my mind forever. Alongwith a couple of other fellows, I was picked to go to work outsidethe ghetto and sent to a German company by the name of “Rawo”.(As I later found out, this company was organized by very richGerman Nazis, so that they and their families would not have togo to the Russian front.) Our job was to load and unload trainswith rags and metal scraps. We were supplied with special redarmbands that had German writing and the logo “Rawo” on them.While we were working, a train came by and stopped for a coalrefill. I heard loud noises and crying children, and when I gotcloser, I saw women and children packed in cattle trains callingout for water. When they noticed me, they screamed out that theyhad gold money for water, not knowing that I was also a Jew. (Iwas blond and wearing that German armband.) I managed to filltwo cans of water, ran to the railroad cars, and pushed the water93CZENSTOCHOV - Our Le*■H■■Harry Klein was among the first typesetters in Yiddish after hisliberation from the Concentration Camps in Munich, Germany, wherehe became co-worker in the Jewish newspaper *'Unzer Weg'’ a weeklypublication, which started on October 12, 1945.2*"I -r-r.'trAdministration, editorial staff and typesetters of ‘‘Unzer Weg inMunich, September 1945.Editor Lavy Szalit: ¥r ; Typesetter Harry Klein: M92CZENSTOCHOV - Our LaJewish Weekly - Munich 1945jf♦jf|KU ‘■KT.HMT n;;nr,sCK.T CKii K .:rn -ifi-j-.s :-s “irv.i'•'K .jTJ'JKl'KC ]'N IKrSl "} I'S UTrrJpK KJr.K,'^ pc ,r,K.T_'V_':- pS "^2pc pH .Hi-n’ p.H j;c ;,Nt 'siinJ-nK Hi V2 L'",Tu-nc:-iv -rv.K:-vs: p.c ‘jk": „ -i t pxtrnVvc'TK yr L'tj’-: ';ru '.y-Vj-n, ,pc ipr'iv)j-n -y-I p.H ,\t:'yr, n .r-rjf:H j.“v:Kuc'Ciriu'-”.x '^r-vp: ipivv '.pnr.H IVcpT ip'vcr cH vpii ipnrK^T*^ ir'ni L'l’ri ps riucY p.c )rrr pn"(Kc \K-r-H n; rz yn-K yi-i',jr)-cp3 u- cj-T :j 'i '"Hrv'Kyt IV :i"i cpTp‘r'‘:c p.s yj'Vf .yp-.i pjpi-r'iHc•INC |cn;:; j:'- k yK'picpic pcrp r,-iK v: ‘-'rf iK':ppn ,L'yj'''SL';p*^ pK vc": "pt-.s “.rjnt.3"K ii'i i:Hn |':pr:i ‘jrN '.pir.s :s:j-N l'vm;n':3thc ;.;S' j k -kc^•':vv ':k= k ps i;r*.i p-cp'c"t vr'^ni r,",H n p-rvJ L'-: rpi.•."t pv pK ,]vcHr: K “,1 vcnsip: pH.i.|KC yiyy'K -T U’'vc'1'.H .c'.L":-n pj-pKC |r-i'‘rL':n n p'rKC cktCJ'pcvN rs t:-u 'h: i'kc v:; l*: -;pv:- p-:-i zy n'.i '^ptr.s ]-k-.u-: L-;r -v-pc c:r"v<*>v^jK,'r -t ’’X'p pv "sc ur .;v.i ^ptrsps yT)y pipniiK j-.c cipt-pp n 'j-::,ppu n psiu-3 •w"iV_*rH'Ci-: p-; -j ppvpnir cpT i:k ‘jx -pv p-:-; -x ix'r.ips ^svisn ]-,c'.'•Syr'TS V pc c! s-iT. pjx .v.srr-cpxxV-'-'' p.c ps p-r- ".N 'r:p=:v.i -iiMTVs jvpi'sc -X ;:x ,y-,c p.scsu y'sc p-vs p.c :y\\ cizy ivtivt"inv',i ps -.rpvv',-Nc -pv p-.p-j I'sps -itT p-sxj p.c l' -.-:l'PX •'iv -,sci:>p*u‘J'isc LpMi .Vj-x:v'>: -;-'s'^vs3.'■:yA -i!:-,s, -p.v prnIV 'r*v c:s yi u-yv:- -p'-.i ->v:-.s,.ps ’j'-.-.-vc ,.-,".s: 'p-Tc-p- -p- p-‘pcp"L"pn yt p-v csp .'s'c - p.spc L'CK:p)-x ps py-_' p.c 3u- .u.xLX-'-pTinsc -jvs vy.-. -p.s r.u csr, '.in lytpK ps .L—v -^yir.s 'px ppiUNZER WEG (OUR WAY)nio'^Dn pD ]sns.i:xxp:-i .pr": ps p" pl'—c^x: n p.c •jpi'-jsppsT-'P'v pin pi-jyiO'nKvrrr. .-.j .-:-'c p.ir.i m y_'"ic .px)xloj; -ixs-^ps 12(ft pr r ' v k t v c • J • 3 1 s p.s y • v ,•? m y 1 pc o y t t sn 1 D T ’“:p ]‘S |>*r,2 yi>i":*s j'K ]pp3np3 n'Dpi'pxSc cy'i’i ’c*H*n .D-njin j-.s ]i.7:pp3^o'ix p'S*n3 '3is ]yyi .np~i.C3D>S y3>i:'3-v:ns*3 n j*,-: p:y"i3X nyp'S'\“i npi ny:i-iyn yp'DiSn yny]n3ix rxjT wcrnn-c.*: n .ly-zcyp'S-cy; n j‘=3 orsnyn oyi t:^ jP3X.‘:^ny"i pSxDi:' d'd."i>3sri:iss nSyn n px jy33i3ynxD I33n3iyi33\x nl‘E ni'n: ‘“i yi::^*i:'>3 "i>p*::'*x nyn3ix pnnx p^S^'n"'•>"1 jx CD'S^n -i 0"iy“i3*iiXD ,jy”r.:ix yny^r'uyn n j'X nyxr^yp p3y‘:"XDy3 ncnvh y::*' yny*] cr'S'3 j:x L3x*^ypy3 pxn y^Syii .ySx n dx - y“iX3nD lyr'i"'.p'r'XD ps pxsj*x nyi:"'‘i’i pyrx t-s |y:xsu' "nzrn-axT nyp'i^syis j\x 33n>nxs nyp^V'n dv:■ ' • n^ny jD’n3u>?. .yi:’T3-x c-u'np rchn pnSiw .six "iy"x jis ]^*'n ypnr:y"niii\L' dxifx cvp jpx'’N jp'i-iyi:"’n oy-i nxs dSx.s'N px s'^D3^5 "lyp-Dsyo lyn p'li'n bxi^’' DyCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy91I received a fcx)d parcel for the week. In September 1945 we movedto our new apartment in Munich.We now wrote to our brother George Klein in Montreal, telling himthat we were alive in Munich. His telegram followed, stating thathe was going to work on immigration papers immediately toenable us to come to Canada. We were delighted with the news.At that time, Canada was still closed for new Jewish immigrantsand we had to wait for a long time to get our papers.Our only goal was to meet our brother and his family. During thewaiting period, each of us got married in Munich: My sister Maniato Chaskel Konarsky, my sister Madzia to Josel Rosenberg andI, myself, to the lovely Chava Borenstein.We continued to exchange letters with our brother. Finally wewere informed that our papers were ready. We arrived in Montrealin 1948 and were at long last united with my brother George andhis family.Soon I became very active in the Czenstochover Society of Montreal.I had the responsibility to rebuild my life, to have a family andto be able to provide for them. In 1951 I opened my own printingcompany. Eva and I had three daughters, Marilyn, Ruthie andJanet, all of whom are married and have children.I will always remember that I am a survivor of the Holocaust. Fbrover 40 years I actively reminded others never to forget our“Kedoshim” who perished in the Holocaust. I always rememberthe vow I took on the day of my liberation from the concentrationcamp in Allach-Dachau. With the publication of the book“Czenstochov - Our Legacy”, I can truly say that I have fulfilledmy duty as a survivor of the Holocaust.Barbed wire enclosed the HASAG Concentration Camp90CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThere I met some people from Czenstochova who suggested thatI go to the Jewish Community Service Centre on Mehl Streetwhere there were listings of people who had survived and werein the area. Unfortunately, these hstings were not helpful to me.I remained in Munich two days longer and was fortunate to meettwo girls from my hometown who told me that the last time theyhad seen my sisters was a few days before the liberation fromHasag in Czenstochova. I was disappointed but determined notto give up. On my return to Feldmoching, I learned from a girlI met on the train that she knew my sisters were living in Buchloe.Several days later I was on my way to Buchloe. I waited along thehighway in search of a ride. I was picked up by a military truck,but after a two-hour ride I was told to get off and was left in themiddle of nowhere. Once again I found myself on the highwaylooking for a ride. This time I was picked up by a military truck,headed in the direction of Buchloe. I then took the train theremainder of the way. As I walked through the streets of Buchloe,I spotted a few girls whom I asked if they knew of my sistersMania and Madzia. They shouted and nodded excitedly andpointed to a house down the road. As I ran toward the house, mysisters came running toward me. We fell into each others armskissing, yelling, laughing and crying. It was an incrediblemoment.My sisters were unaware that I had survived the concentrationcamps. I remained with them for two weeks. They told me thatthe last days before the liberation, many people from Hasag wereloaded onto trucks and deported to another concentration campin Ravensbruck, Germany. They also told me that they had runaway and had been in hiding on a farm, not knowing that the warwas over.We decided that I would return to Feldmoching, to find a placefor us to stay. They would join me later. When I arrived in Feld-mochtng, I discovered a note from John informing me that he wasreturning to Czechoslovakia and that, maybe, we would meetagain one day.I was now on my own, with a great responsibility to my sisters.Our reunion caused me to change my outlook to a more positiveone. I was now the one who had to care for the three of us andsee to it that we be reunited with our brother George who wasliving in Montreal, Canada, since before the war.At the Rental and Housing Office in Munich, I met a lady whooffered me two rooms in her apartment on Maximilian Strasse.With a place to live in Munich, I registered our names with theJewish Community office for food rations. There I came upon anotice looking for Yiddish typesetters for the weekly newspaper“Unzer Weg”. I applied and was accepted for the job as typesetter.CZENSTQCHOV - Our Lee&cy89(military police) passed by, one of whom stopped us and askedwhere we were going. John replied in English that we wereheading to the nearest village. He then pointed at me, explainingthat it was impossible for me to walk. At first there was silence.Then we were invited into the jeep. We stopped at the first military}X)st where several American soldiers came over to us. One of thempicked me up onto his shoulder and asked another soldier to takea photograph.The two M.P.s returned to the jeep with a sack of canned food.It seemed that they had orders to take us to Feldmoching. The jeeparrived at the house of a middle-aged woman who timidly, butpolitely, introduced herself as Frau Bauer. The American soldiertold her that I was very weak and asked if she would allow meto remain in her house for a few weeks until I was strong enoughto leave. The American instructed her not to feed me with thecanned food. He told her to give me small portions of cooked ricewith milk and to increase these portions gradually. After theAmericans thanked her and left, John stayed on for a while longer.He later left to look for a place to stay and he promised me thathe would be back in a few days.As I looked around the room, I wondered if this was real or merelya dream. There was a clean bed with pillows, a clean towel andsoap. After I had washed myself, Frau Bauer gave me a small bowlof rice and milk and told me to eat slowly. Feeling very tired, Iwent to bed. I cried myself to sleep. The next morning, Frau Bauertold me she had heard me cry in my sleep.I stayed at Frau Bauer’s house for over four weeks. I had beenquite fortunate, as I later learned, for many of those who had sur-vived the camps later died because of the large quantities of richfood they consumed, which made them ill. John came to see meand invited me to stay with him, once I was feeling stronger.Gazing at the tatooed number on my left arm which was part ofmy nightmare, it was hard for me to believe that I was now a freeman. I had to try not to think at all. I isolated myself. I did notwant to leave the security of my newly-found home. One morn-ing, Frau Bauer suggested that I go outside for some fresh air.I refused to comply which caused her to say angrily that I wasnot the only one who had suffered. She herself had lost her hus-band and son in this war. I ignored her. I told her that I would bemoving to my friend’s house in a week. Leaving, I thanked FrauBauer for all she had done for me.In Feldmoching, I met two survivors who advised me to go to the“UNRRA” office, located in Munich, to obtain identification cardswhich would then enable me to register with the City HaU in Feld-moching. I went to Munich on a Sunday morning in July 1945.88CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyMY MEMOIRS - continuedDestined to SurviveI do not know how long I stood at the gates of “Liberation” onMay 5, 1945, at the Allach-Dachau Concentration Camp. At 80pounds, I was a living skeleton contemplating the tatooed numberon my left arm, an everlasting reminder of the Birkenau-Ausch-witz death camp.Tears ran down my face. These were neither tears of joy nor pity,but were tears of anger at the world. . . What was I to do now?. . .I thought about my family . . . did anyone survive? I cried out andmade a vow that as long as I would live, I would always rememberthose who perished in the death factories and gas chambers, forthe “crime” of being Jews. It occurred to me that my destinywas to survive and speak about all I had experienced and makethe world listen.My thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a military guard whotold me to go back to the barrack. I went back inside and lookedfor a place on the floor. I was tired and fell asleep. The shrill soundof the sirens woke me and voices over the loud speaker announcedthat the very weak would be taken by ambulance to receive medi-cal care. I was afraid and wanted to be left alone. Surely I wouldnot seek any medical help.Near me on the floor lay a man who informed me that the Germanshad gone and that we were free to go anywhere we wanted. Heasked if I would accompany him to the nearest village. He wasfamiliar with the region. About 3 kilometers from the camp wasa place called Feldmoching.Early the next morning, we left the camp through an opening ina broken wire fence, an exit used by many. As we walked, he in-troduced himself as John from Prague, Czechoslovakia. He hadbeen arrested by the Gestapo and sent to work on a farm nearMunich, Germany. He was a strong man who spoke severallanguages, including English.As we walked along the road, we saw military people on trucksmarked “U.S. Army” in bold letters. Several Jeeps marked “M.P.”CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy87MY HOME TOWN ... I WILL NEVER FORGET YOUDestroyed is my Home-Townthe one I do lemember,and wiped-out is my familywith all of its splendor.Deep in my thoughtsof the past so fruitful,when I was together with my parentsI saw everything so rosy and beautiful.As I am now dreaming of theonce upon a time,oh! how I do miss youeach time and all the time.And you my dear motherI remember you — lovable and bright,always with a smile — whenshe kissed and hugged me so tight.And my father my idolwho seemed always in learning to be,has never failed to showhis care and love for me.Now is my heart so bleedingand bitter with pain,because destroyed is my past — andit will never, never more be the same.But in my memory my home townyou will always stay with me,the way I have known youso beautiful and great I wanted you to be.And in my heartyou will remain forever more,and I will see you alwaysno other — but the way as before.by HARRY KLEINNov. 11/8486Auschwitz Railway GateCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy85of that year I was again put on a cattle train and sent to Sachsen-hausen/Oranienburg. The Germans did not really know any morewhat to do with us. It became obvious that their war machine wasdisintegrating fast.By April 1945 I found myself in Dachau—Allach. A few days laterI was again commanded to march, but I was no longer able to con-tinue and remained in Allach, where I was liberated by Americansoldiers on May 5, 1945.I have lived through Auschwitz and I have survived several othercamps in which tens of thousands have died. My story is a smallepisode in the huge mosaic of torture and destruction which maynever be complete, in spite of a large body of documentation andliterature in many languages.The Jewish people of the world still suffer a sense of bereavementfrom the losses inflicted on them fifty years ago in Europe - lossesof life, of learning, losses of old books and old synagogues. Thedamage of our cultural property and to “Yiddishkeit” is irrepar-able.Does it not teach us to fight the growing acceptance of violence,aggression and nationalistic hatred that seems to be Sweeping theworld? If we are the “chosen people”, let us not only be chosento suffer, but also chosen to teach righteousness and tolerance.... and these are the remains.Heaps of shoeSy a tragic memorial to the millions.84nTir.NSTOCHOV - Out LegacyWe were informed that we would stay in Birkenau as a work force.First we were quarantined for a period of time in sjiecial barracks.Immediately on entering the barrack I handed my parcel to theblock Capo. He closed his door. Rachela told me later that she senthim six shirts, ten pieces of soap, two gold watches, five gold coinsand some rings.The trick worked. The block Cajx) let me know that after thetattooing I should come to see him in his room. After the quaran-tine period I should not report for work. He will send me to workwith a special small group. He was sure my sister-in-law wouldtry to see me again.The next day we were ordered to take a shower and to have ourhair cut. We got the camp clothing which was sprayed with chemi-cals. Back at the barracks we were tattooed on our left arm.When the letter “K” was called, the three of us - Klein, Kohn,Krakowski - stood together once again. But when we were askedto volunteer for work according to our trade, Sam Kohn andYitzchak Krakowski were separated from me. I was transferredto Birkenau Lager “D”, Block 22.I was isolated and so lost contact with Rachela. My work wasnot specific. Each day I was assigned to a different group. Loneli-ness and depression overcame me and while I was physically stillstrong, I felt mentally near despair. Working in the shadow of thegas chambers and crematoria, breathing the stench of humanflesh daily, I felt trapped, despondent, hopeless.I was at one of the nerve centres of Hitler’s “final solution’’, ata place which revealed a dimension of human nature never beforeobserved in modern history. It was the systematic perversion ofhumanity.As one who witnessed it all but was unable to understand it fully,I grew bitter about those misguided individuals who pronouncetoday, that all of this never happened. They lie in the face of wit-nesses like myself, against the evidence of photos, films and docu-ments, against evidence supplied by the perpetrators themselves.I take it as a personal insult to hear the denial of what EuropeanJewry went through. It all hapjiened while the world watched pas-sively. The world even watched passively when it heard of thedesperate suicidal uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto by thosemartyrs who had nothing to lose. They saved Jewish digmty atthe cost of their lives.In the beginning of 1944, when the defeat of the Nazis becameincreasingly certain, the gas ovens of Birkenau worked overtime.Thousands of Jews were sent on terrible death marches, intendedto deny them liberation by the advancing allied forces. In OctoberCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy83MY MEMOIRS - continuedSurviving in AuschwitxWhen the war on the Eastern Front began to go badly for theGermans, Blizin was scheduled to be closed and we were to beevacuated. Shmulek, Yitzchak and myself did all we could to staytogether when the transport order came.I was 25 years old when I arrived at the Inferno of Auschwitz—Birkenau. Ever since, I have lived with memories that a thousandyears could not erase. The sight of flames from the crematoriumovens in the night sky are still in my mind’s eye and I can stillsmell the stench of human flesh. A new vocabulary would beneeded to describe the pain on the faces of the victims and theviciousness of the executioners or the callous ingenuity of theNazi planners.There were 1800 of us who arrived from Blizin. We were firstchased by Germans with police dogs, which terrified us. After halfan hour we came to a barbed wire fence and a large gate throughwhich we entered a huge open area. There was yet another fence.The German guards with their dogs now left us standing there.Beyond the fence we faced barracks where we saw women goingin and out.Dusk was falling as I stood, occupied with my thoughts andanxieties. Was there someone calling my name ? Yes, again I he^my name called and the voice came from beyond the barbed wirefence. I could no longer see clearly and walked a little closer. ThereI saw my sister-in-law, my brother Yankel’s wife. Rachela! Iyelled. The last time I had seen Rachela was in the selection fromthe small ghetto in Czenstochova.I learned later that Rachela had arrived at Auschwitz a year earlierfrom Sosnowice. She wanted to talk and talk. As it got darker shehanded me a parcel across the fence “Give this to the‘Blockaeltesten Capo’ ” she told me. “It will make your life a lit-tle bit easier.’’ She promised to give me a lot of help and to keepin touch with me.Rachela was in the women’s quarter, called Lager “C’’, workingwith an ehte group named “Canada’’. Their job was to sort outthe belongings of those who had been gassed.82CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leg&oyWhen I arrived at Blizin it was lucky for me to meet WowekBrokman. Brokman was born in Czenstochova. As an electricianby trade he was sent to Blizin in advance to help build the camp.He became foreman of the electricians and therefore he could helpme register at the camp office and join his group as an assistantelectrician.Thanks to his initiative I could avoid really hard physical labour.Other Czenstochovers, who were privileged to work as tradesmen.In our group of electricians were Harshel Konsens, YitzchakKrakowski, Pinia Mager and Leon Werkzeig from Radom.I shared all my good news with Sam (Szmulek) Kohn. He andYitzchak Krakowski became my very close friends in Blizin. Wetook care of each other — “Achim TTzoro” — and our being likebrothers gave us the strength and willpower to live for the dayof our liberation. But freedom was still only a dream.The Purim Exchange to PalestineIn February 1943, rumours circulated that those who had familiesin Palestine could be exchanged for German prisoners now inEnglish captivity. There was a ray of hope as the possibility ofNazi defeat came to mind for the first time. Registration of thosewho had relatives in Palestine began at once. Members of theJewish Resistance Movement felt skeptical since they could notbelieve that the Nazis would allow witnesses to live who could tellthe world of the mass killings of Jews. However, the registrationcontinued until the list was complete.One day before Purim, Commander Degenhart came into theghetto, inspected a few of the places, then went to the office ofthe Judenrat. He declared that the exchange could take place, sug-gesting that members of the Judenrat, as well as the intelligent-sia and their families, be the first to go. On the following day,Purim, everyone in the ghetto went to work as usual, except thoseselected to be exchanged. They were all assembled on the MarketSquare. Degenhart told them to walk in the direction of “NovyRinek”, the New Market. As they walked along WarszawskaStreet, everything appeared to be calm. However, when they ap-proached No. 9 Warszawska, they were suddenly surrounded byGerman police and forced into police trucks. They then headedin the direction of the Jewish cemetery, not the train station asthey had been promised. They were now trapped without anychance of resistance. In despair, some struggled with police, somejumped from the moving trucks, some committed suicide byswallowing cyankali tablets. Most of the victims were killed at thecemetery. On that tragic day, 157 of the Jewish intelligentsia weremurdered in cold blood by the Nazis.How can we foi^ve or forget? That Purim day, March 2, 1943,will be remembered in the history of Czenstochova, as “BloodyPurim”.CZENSTOCHOV ~ Our Legacy81well as transferees from other camps. My friends HershelKonsens and Vovek Brookman both perished. YitzchakKrakowski now lives in Israel. Sam Kohn lives in Fairlawn, NewJersey.The daily routines were often interrupted by incidents that filledour hearts with terror. One day at noon, we could see the JewishCamp Police and the Ukrainian guards running in the directionof a group of workers at the camp gates. An alarm sounded andeveryone had to line up outside their barracks to be counted. Welearned that six inmates from the Czenstochover section hadescaped and could not be found. Their names were called out overand over again as we stood for more than two hours at the‘ Appell”. A high-ranking Nazi officer, named Betcher, came for-ward and issued an order that, due to the escape of the sixprisoners, another six were to be executed. Szlamek Minzbergcalled out the names of four men who were sick, as well as twobrothers, who all stepped forward. The six condemned men wereimmediately surrounded by Ukrainian executioners and, togetherwith three inmates of the camp carrying shovels, taken away. Onewitness to the execution later told me of the torture that the sixmartyrs had undergone. They had been ordered to dig their owngraves and, when they refused, they were again brutally beatenwith rifles. Their bloodied bodies, lying on the ground, were finallyshot. The Ukrainians ordered the three men with shovels to digthe graves. The entire incident left an indelible mark on us all.After that day, the barracks were guarded both day and night. Todeter any further such escapes, we were told that each man wasresponsible for the person to his left and to his right. Shouldanyone escape, then the two men to his sides were to be executed.Two days later, as I worked with some electricians repairing thelights in the guardhouse, we again heard loud voices. Looking out-side, I could see two men lying on the ground being beaten byrifles. Nell, the camp commander, then came out ordering thebeatings to stop. We could now see Arye Mandelbaum and Lemel,two of the group who had escaped earlier that week. SzlamekMinzberg, the head of the Jewish Police, was ordered to take thetwo men to the kitchen for a meal and to be questioned. The twotalked about their escape and their eventual recapture. They hadheaded for the forest and then to the highway, looking for food.They were attacked by several Poles and then dragged back intothe forest, where they were robbed and stripped of their clothing.They were later taken to a farm house and kept prisoner until thePblish police arrived and they were returned to the camp. The twoi70fused to give any information as to the whereabouts of the otherfour, who were still missing. They were tortured and, after manyhours of brutal investigation, they were taken away and shot.80CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyWe continued marching and upon our arrival at the train station,we were pushed inside cattle cars and locked up. Two hours later,the doors opened and again, we were ordered to march to thepolice station on Pilsudskiego Street, where we stayed until thenext day. Again we were ordered to the train station and into thecattle cars, about 120 people to a car. At Blizin, a forced-labourconcentration camp, we were met by guards who beat us whilewe were leaving the cars.In the Forced-Labour Camp, BlizinWe marched a long distance to the site of the concentration camp.The gates were guarded by Polish police and Ukrainian guards.We were ordered to stop and remove our hats. A high-ranking Ger-man officer was informed that we were a transport of several hun-dred Jewish inmates. We were given instructions that we wouldeach be registered and would each receive a numbered metal platethat must be worn around our necks at all times. All our posses-sions had to be turned in, and anyone discovered with more thanfive German marks would immediately be shot.After registration, we went through a second gate and came toan area that was separated from the front entrance by water. Wewere then taken to wooden barracks. Tired and hungry, I restedon an upper bunk bed. I later met two Russian P.O.W.s who toldme that over 4,000 had died of forced labour and starvation in thiscamp. They pointed towards a forest and called it “the graveyard”.These P.O.W.s had managed to stay alive because they were elec-tricians, a valuable occupation to the Nazis. I noticed a huge barrelat the entrance to the barracks. Looking inside, I found blackwater which I later learned was coffee. I again went to lie down.On the bunks nearby were my friends — Szmulek Kohn, YitzchakKrakowski and Hershel Konsens. At dawn the next morning, Iwas awakened by loud voices. Many of the prisoners ran to thebarrel of black water for drinks and were given a portion of bread.The “Kapos”, block police, were hitting everyone on their headsand ordering us to go outside the barracks. The camp commanderwas given a report that one person was missing. The campgrounds were searched as all the inmates stood lined up untilabout 2 o’clock that afternoon. Fbrtunately, the missing personproblem was solved when it was discovered that one person hadregistered twice.The same day, I was given a place to work with the group ofelectricians.Night followed day in endless oppressive progression. In additionto people from Czenstochova, the inmates of Blizin were from thetowns of Ibmashev, Skorzisk, Piotrkov, Plaszov and Radom, asCZENSTOCHOV — Our Liegax^79faces were covered with blood. They had been apprehendedoutside the ghetto fence. Later, the German jxjlice handed the twomen over to the Ukrainian guards in the market square. Theycould always be relied upon to commit the most evil acts. Shotsrang out. Two young lives were snuffed out. It was just one of thedaily occurrences.The news soon spread that a selection of children and elderlypeople had taken place during the day and that they had been sentto Treblinka to be killed. Panic and fear rose in the ghetto.Rumours again spread that another round-up would take placesometime in mid-March.Other rumours traveling through the ghetto were that the policehad orders to arrest 18 people to be sent to Blizin to build aconcentration camp.We were terrorized almost daily. During each march to the slavelabour, somebody was taken out and thrown into the “Yatke” (jail).On March 17th, 1943, a friend who worked at the “Varta”, anotherwork group, told me that the ghetto police were planning morearrests. My sister, Madzia, asked me not to go to work as arrestswere always made from each work group. Many who left in themorning did not return at night, but were sent to the “yatke”, theprison. I was afraid to remain in the ghetto and went to work. Twofrom our group were arrested. When we arrived at our place ofwork, “Schott”, the German officer on duty, noticed that two car-penters were missing. After hearing that these two men had beenarrested, he angrily ordered me and another man to report to thearrest house in exchange for the two carpenters. Now, I foundmyself among the people who were going to be deported.On that March 17th, all prisoners were assembled in the marketplace (Rineczek). The Nazi Degenhart told us not to worry andthat we were going to work in the shoe factory in Blizin. We werethen herded into ranks of four by German police, armed withrifles, and ordered to march through the streets. We passed somedeserted buildings with broken windows that, at one time, wereshops owned by Jewish shopkeepers, and were now marked withan “X”, after being plundered and destroyed by the Nazis. Sud-denly I heard the sound of a rifle shot. I was pushed by a Ukrai-nian guard holding a rifle and we were ordered to “Sztajn bleiben”,to stop. A few had run away from the marching group and werehiding in the empty buildings. Thinking that it was a good idea,I also started running in the direction of the buildings, but waschased by a Ukrainian guard yelling, “Kuda Kuda”. We were allcaptured and forced back to our group. We were fortunate thatno one was killed.78CZENSTOCHOV ~ Our LegacyMY MEMOIRS - continuedThe End of the **Small Ghetto**For a while, it was peaceful in the ghetto, until the last random“selection” and killing of 27 people took place in the marketsquare. The ghetto was no longer safe. I decided to change mywork place to outside the ghetto walls. I had been working in thetechnical department of E. Epstein. My sisters Mania and Madzia,who lived together in the small ghetto greeted my decision as goodnews. I was accepted to work as a window glass cutter with therenovation group, which was supervised by a German officernamed Schott. I had very little work to do. Most of the work wasdone by carpenters. Nonetheless, there were tense moments, par-ticularly when the ghetto commander Degenhart arrived “toinspect each building”.Our fear was that he might detect the hiding place of the childrenand elderly who were hidden in bunkers. We became convincedthat he suspected this and, therefore, came for these frequentvisits. While working outside the ghetto, people always worriedabout the lives of their families. They worried that a selection ofelderly people might take place during the day. Degenhart wasdetermined to find the childrens’ hiding places. He convened theJewish ghetto leaders and told them that he was aware that somechildren were still hiding in the bunker and that it was a crimeto torture children. He declared, most seriously, that he plannedto open a daycare for children up to the age of 14, in the ghetto.They would be cared for by their own mothers. The mothers wouldno longer go to work outside the ghetto. They would have theopportunity to be with their children all day. Degenhart’s plan toopen a daycare center was neither believable nor comprehensible.However, it was accepted by the people who also hoped that suchconcern would be extended to the elderly.The ghetto was always full of frightening rumours; terrible thingshappened every day.Once, as I was going to install some windows, I witnessed ahorrible scene. The ghetto police and German police, together withDegenhart, were brutally beating two young men. The youngsters’CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy77out of my hiding place, looking for Yankel, I was told he had beenselected for deportation. I had no more tears left. Now only mytwo sisters, my sister-in-law Rachela and I were left.How can words describe the great tragedy brought up)on myinnocent family by a mere few gestures? I had witnessed thedeath sentence pronounced on my parents and on my twobrothers. How can one possibly describe the agonizing silence pre-ceding a selection or the gut-wrenching moment when Rachelahad to give up her one-year-old baby girl to a certain death ?From “Metaliirgia” to the*‘Small Ghetto”The liquidation of the Large Ghetto of Czenstochova was completedon October 4, 1942 when the last batch of victims was sent to theirdeath in the gas chambers of Treblinka. The world did not seemto care. . . . Our Polish neighours stood by and watched.All the buildings and homes were now vacant. There was ahorrible emptiness, an air of fear. The few thousand Jews whoremained as slave labourers were stripped of their identity, dignityand humanity. Eventually they were sent to a smaller ghetto inthe poor part of Czenstochova.The “small ghetto” was in the north-east section of the city. TheGerman authorities had commandeered a few homes on MostovaStreet, Kozia, half of Nadrzeczna, half of Garncarska and a fewhomes on Spadek Street. This ghetto was set up as shelter for thesurvivors from the Large Ghetto, who were chosen to work at theweapons factory, called HASAG Pelcern and in other forced labourgroups.The ghetto was surrounded with barbed wire. Armed sentrieswere posted at the gates. We went to our usual work places everyday, returning at night to sleep in the overcrowded rooms. Therewas no privacy, nor were there kitchen facilities. Only inmateswho were registered at their work places were entitled to mealswhen they returned from work. A special kitchen was set up onNadrzeczna Street. The daily rations consisted of half a kilogramof bread, half a litre of coffee and half a litre of soup for dinner.At six o’clock in the morning we had to report to our assignedgroup to leave the ghetto for work. Each time — leaving andreturning — we were counted and searched.In spite of being treated like vermin, the inhabitants of the ghettoestablished a Jewish Resistance Organization. When the Germanauthorities became aware of its existence, they entered the ghettoperiodically trying to track it down.76CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyMY MEMOIRS - continuedTragedy Strikes My FamilyDegenhart stood at the new market place holding a thin stick inhis white-gloved hand. As the frightened crowd of Jewish men andwomen was paraded before him, he pointed his stick left and right,separating those he selected for deportation from the ones he con-sidered fit for work. Fbr those sent to the left, cattle cars werealready waiting at the railway station, destined for the Treblinkadeath camp. My brother Yankel, who had married Rachela Hager-man in 1940, lived with his wife and baby daughter on Nadrze-czna Stret. My parents, my siblings and I decided to go totheir house so that the whole family could go to the “selection”together. It was Monday, September 28, 1942, the seventeenth dayof Tishrei and the first day of Hoi Homoed Sukot. We clungto each other. When we were told to get ready, we stood in linehelpless and terrified. Degenhart had assumed the power todecide who should live and who should die. My brother Yankel wasthe first to pass. Degenhart glared at him for a few agonizingmoments then sent him to the right. Yankel could go to theMetalurgia. My sister-in-law Rachela and her baby daughter weresent to the left which meant death. But Rachela managed to getanother chance. She quickly handed the child to my mother andslipped back into the line-up. When her turn came again she wassent to the right - she would live. My parents were selected forthe death train. Lastly my sisters Mania and Madzia, my youngerbrother Yechiel and myself were sent to the right.We cried in despair, knowing that we would never see our parentsagain, that they were condemned to death. We embraced eachother to gain the strength to walk to the Metalurgia.As we entered the grounds, my brother Yechiel was stopped andasked his age. He was not allowed to pass. Instead he was trans-ferred to a group destined for deportation.After some hours of waiting, announcements came through onthe loudspeaker. Another selection was to be made. We had to beready for registration later that day. I told my brother Yankel thatI was going to hide until this registration was over. When I cameCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy75vaded the ghetto air. Something awful was going to happen. Thenews from outside was ominous. Lithuanian and Ukrainianguards in black uniforms were seen in different parts of the city.The Judenrat, as well as all the German authorities, tried in vainto give assurances in order to calm the ghetto population. Theshocking experience of that night is still vivid in my memory. Inthe evening, everybody was at home worrying about the darkrumours. Nobody could go to sleep. It was a very black night. Thestreet lights were off and, therefore, it was impossible to distin-guish any activity in the streets. Suddenly, a few minutes pastmidnight, all the street lights came on. There was a lot of noiseand confusion. German and Ukrainian guards, in full combatgear, shouted, threatened and pointed rifles. The Jewish ghettopolice, running in every direction, added to the confusion.At 5 A.M., the shooting began. People were chased and herdedinto small frightened groups. Many carried small bundles of per-sonal belongings. Women held their young and crying children.The guards shouted orders in rapid succession: “schnell machen,schnell, schnell!” The Jewish police came to every house onDegenhart’s orders: “Get out, leave your keys in the door. Anyonefound hiding will be shot.”All Jewish lives were now at risk. As people were driven from theirhomes and hustled through the streets, they were sprayed withautomatic rifle fire, unprovoked and upredictably. Hundreds werekilled or left dying in the streets. The first streets emptied in thisway were Kavia, Koszarova, Warsover Market, Warsover Street upto Garibaldiego and Wilsona.That day — Yom Kippur, 1942 — Degenhart condemned 7,000Czenstochova Jews to die in the gas chambers. The rest were sentto the “Metalurgia”, a large industrial plant converted into alabour camp.Photo taken in Czenstochova in 1940, during the occupation.Members of the organisation^^AKIBA'\ sitting from the left:Mendel Berkowicz, who was shotin a bunker, Mayer Jakubowicz,who died in Theresienstadt, nextto him is Ruven Dzialecki.Standing from the left:Mendel Berkowicz, shot in abunker (a cousin of the samename), Zysie Schwartz, IlekLaks, who lives in Israel and athird cousin, also named MendelVerkowicz was shot in thebunker as well.74CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyMY MEMOIRS - continuedThe Liquidation of the “Large Ghetto”During THE YEAR OF 1942 five deportations took place. Their aimwas to destroy the entire Jewish community of Czenstochova. Thefirst occurred on September 22, the second three days later, thethird on September 28, followed by two more, on October 1 andOctober 4.The sadistic commander Degenhart was personally in charge andresponsible for all of them. A Jewish community that had existedfor over 300 years was to be destroyed with ruthless efficiency.One day in June 1942, Commander Degenhart issued an unusualorder: The whole ghetto population, between the ages of 15 and50 was to be assembled with their working cards, to checkwhether everyone was correctly registered with his work detailOver 20,000 people came to this “Appell” (roll call). Nobodysuspected that it was, in fact, a rehearsal for the planned destruc-tion of the Czenstochova ghetto.The Judenrat was charged with providing a specific number ofworkers daily to serve the German authorities. In addition, Jewswere rounded up in the streets and in house-to-house searchesand hauled away to perform all kinds of work around the city.Gradually, the terror in the ghetto intensified. New and harsherlaws were passed every day. With every law, fear and uncertaintyincreased and made life intolerable. In August 1942, the ghettocommunity was near panic; rumours spread that a DeportationCommando was about to liquidate the large ghetto and that theJews of Czenstochova were to prepare for deportation.The First Selection for Deportation- Yom Kippur 1942Yom Kippur morning, September 21, 1942, seemed like anymorning in the ghetto. The labour commandos left for theirassigned working places. The dark figures of elderly Jewsscurried anxiously through the deserted streets, hoping not to benoticed. They wanted to reach the synagogue unharmed, where theywould spend their hohest day in prayer. Uncertainty and fear per-CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy73On a very cold Friday in January 1940, the Jewish women wereparticularly intimidated. Grerman soldiers attacked Jewish homesforcing the women, often half-naked, out of their beds and on tothe streets. My mother was among them. They were marched tothe New Market Place, where they were detained for hours infreezing cold weather. Some were eventually sent home, while therest were driven to a school on Narutowicz Street. There, theywere ordered to undress completely. After being subjected toinsults and ridicule all night and into the morning, they werepermitted to return home.April 9, 1941, was marked by an official public notice at City Hall,printed on red paper. It was signed by Dr. Wendler: “Let it beknown, that as of April 9, 1941, my order is to set up a closed livingsection for all the Jewish inhabitants of Czenstochova, that willinclude the streets listed below. The transfer date for all the Jewsto the assigned streets will end on April 17. Those who .will notcomply, will have to leave the City. They will be allowed to takewith them 25 kg of personal belongings per head. The Polish inha-bitants living in the ghetto section must leave on the assigneddate.’’Was this the beginning of the end? The Jewish people of Czen-stochova were to be locked up in a ghetto. None of our neighboursoutside the ghetto showed concern. They did not bat an eyelid.It was a Jewish problem. What would happen next? We wereshocked, depressed, but not in despair. Hope was the answer. Onecarried the burden and waited for tomorrow. Will there be atomorrow? Hope sustained us.Jews and ^Aryans”Polish police guards were stationed at the entrance to the “LargeGhetto” which was enclosed by barbed wire. The non-Jewishneighbours were not permitted to visit or to carry on businessinside the ghetto, biit they were allowed to pass it on their wayto the city. A sign was posted in every corner of the ghetto whichread: Jews Leaving The Ghetto Without Authorization WillBe Shot. Non-Jews Walking Inside The Ghetto For ThePurpose Of Buying Or Selling Will Be Sent To Prison.The ghettos were a revival of the medieval idea of confining allJews to small, segregated areas of the cities. For the Nazis,ghettos provided a convenient source of slave labor. The Jewishinmates were a helpless, dehumanized workforce for Grerman fac-tories, installations and offices. By October 1940 about 350,000of Poland’s Jews were behind the barbed wires of ghettos.72CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyI was with my parents and the rest of the family at our home onBerka Joselewicza. There were hard knocks with rifle butts onour door. We heard German voices shouting, “All men over the ageof 15, Raus! Raus! Past Schnell” German soldiers chased myfather and me into the street, our hands held high over our heads.We saw many of our fellow citizens in the same position, runningin the same direction and hundreds of others lying on the ground.We kept running as far as the church where we were keptprisoners. After a few hours, my father was released and senthome. I was forced to remain in the church overnight. The nextmorning, a German officer came to the church and selected 50people to follow him. I was one of them. Our job was to find peo-ple, shot dead in the street during this German action, and to loadthe dead bodies on a truck for burial. When this horrible job wasdone, I was allowed to go home. But the wild random shooting con-tinued. Homes were set on fire with the people trapped in them.Suddenly, without any provocation, Germans opened fire withtheir automatic machine guns. Fix)m then on, the Germans beganto attack people on the streets and in their homes. People wereordered to stand with their hands over their heads. Many weredriven to Katedralna Street, New Market Place, Strazatzka Streetand to City Hall. In each of these places, they were ordered to lieface down. Hundreds of them were killed in the streets byautomatic rifle fire. This horrible day became known as “BloodyMonday”.Fbllowing Bloody Monday, the Jewish people began to sufferincreasingly at the hands of their tormentors. The cruelest mem-ber of the Gestapo in Czenstochova was a man by the name ofShabelski, who was Volksdeutsch. He was considered the terrorof the city, not only by the Jewish population, but also by the Poles.Initially we did not realize that this was also going to be a waragainst the Jews. However, with each passing day the intensity ofpersecutions increased. Every day people were rounded up to doforced labour in the city and on the highways. During heavysnowfalls, in the winter of 1940, men were pulled out of their bedsin the middle of the night to shovel snow. During one such raidI was apprehended but managed to escape. After this incident Ihid in a credenza in our kitchen, which was used to store thePassover dishes. Nobody could suspect that someone was hidingin such a small space. I was never caught again during any of thefollowing forced labour roundups.One of the first official laws proclaimed by the German occupierswas that all Jews from the age of 14 must wear a white armbandon their left arm with a blue ten centimeter Star of David printedon it. A large Star of David had to be placed on the windows ofJewish-owned stores.CZENSTOCHQV - Our Legacy71MY MEMOIRS - continuedThe First Days of the Warin CzenstochovaEven during the years before the Nazis invaded Poland, eventsin Germany influenced and increased anti-Semitism in Czensto-chova. There were pogroms in the city and in the late thirties itbecame dangerous for Jewish people to walk on the Alley Pro-menade — the most beautiful in Czenstochova — in the evening.On the first day of the War, Friday, September 1, 1939, it becameclear that the Germans were going to occupy the City of Czensto-chova. The attack came shortly after the retreat of the Polish Ar-my. The city was in a state of panic. The population searched forways to escape. The last trains and private vehicles headed in thedirection of Warsaw and Kielce. Soon roads were crowded withpeople fleeing the approaching Germans.German airplanes flew very low above, shooting with automaticweapons at the panic-stricken people. The roads were lined withdead bodies. The first German motorized columns arrived onSunday, September 3. There were advance patrols driving throughour city. In the afternoon of that same day, large units of Germanmilitary forces followed. Czenstochova was now under occupation.A mood of depression spread throughout the population.Czenstochova was one of the first cities in Pbland to be occupiedby the Nazis. One could feel the tension. The people were in thestreets, reading the German military decrees. German soldiersmingled with the crowd. They handed out cookies and chocolateto the people, who trustingly accepted their goodwill gesture.The Tragic MondayOn Monday morning, September 4, 1939, the first German decreedemanded that all stores and other business establishments beopened. As during peace time, the city streets were filled withpedestrians. Now these same people were shocked to see Germanjxihce herding their fellow citizens at rifle p)oint. Many of themwere half-dressed. These scenes made a lasting and shockingimpression on us all who witnessed them. We knew then that wecould expect very harsh times.70CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leff&cyZionist “Mizrachi” movement and later influenced me to join himin the “Hashomer Hadati” youth group of that movement. It wasnot long before I was chosen to be one of the leaders in my“Kvutza”. During the years preceding the outbreak of the SecondWorld War, I was very active in Hashomer Hadati. Yankel becamea staff membr of the Zionist weekly “Unzer Weg”. Tragically, he,like many other members of my closest family, fell victim to theHolocaust. My friend Zvi Rosenwein had known Yankel well. AfterWorld War II, when Zvi was a journalist in New York, he remem-bered him in a moving eulogy in the Yiddish weekly “AlgemeinerJournal”. He described Yankel as a brilliant man and talentedwriter. The article was reprinted in the Czenstochover book, pub-lished in 1965 in Montreal.When I was 18 years old I decided toleave the Yeshiva in order to learn atrade. My father was not very pleasedwith the decision. However, a cousin,Isack Szczecinsky, a printer, intro-duced me to Chaim Weisberg whoowned the weekly newspaper “DieZeit”, distributed in Czenstochovaand vicinity. Weisberg hired me as histypesetter at a salary of 10 zlotys perweek. That was my start in the print-ing trade and I was very proud of it.

My parents, Rivka (nee Zylberszatz) and Moshe MordchaKleiner, named me Hershel. I was the third of their six children.I had a very close relationship with my two older brothers, Georgeand Yankel. I always felt protective and responsible for myyounger sisters Mania and Madzia and my younger brotherYechiel. Our parents were prominent in the local middle class, andobservant of Jewish law and ritual. We loved and respected them.My mother was a soft, charming woman with a ready smile. Myfather, who for many years was a successful businessman, alwaysfound time for his Talmudic studies. His teachings and convic-tions determined my religious upbringing and guided me through-out my life, though later I chose to adapt to a more modern lifestyle.I received my education first at cheder, then at secondary schooland at Yechiel Grillaks private school, where I received my highschool diploma. At my parents’ request, I continued my studiesat a Talmudic Academy, known as the “Lumer Yizchak”, in pre-paration for the Yeshiva. Subsequently, I attended Yeshiva for twoyears.I was still quite young when my brother George married HelaBrukner. They moved to Mondzev, Poland, where their son Jackwas born. In 1927 the young couple emigrated with their infantson to Montreal, Canada.My brother Yankel, a tall, blue-eyed fellow, was educated in theYeshiva “Keser Torah”.

The basic function of thetwenty Jewish family camps, which were spread thmughouteastern Europe and the western territories of Russia, was to sei’veas a refuge for thousands of men, women, and children, both in-dividuals and families. The size of the camps varied, from campsof a few families to those with hundreds of families. The twolargest family camps were in the dense forests of Belorussia. Onewas commanded by Tuviah Belski and contained 1,200 Jews; thesecond was under the command of Shimon Zorin and held 800people. Army units composed of partisans defended the campsboth against Nazi forces that had besieged the forests and againstthe non-Jewish partisans. An additional function of the units wasto locate food for the camps’ inhabitants by utilizing partisans’methods. This was accomplished through confiscation by threator by force. Here it should be mentioned that while farmers weregenerally ready to allow the seizure of food by non-Jewish par-tisans, they rebelled against confiscation attempts by the Jewishpartisans for their family camps.Even though the family camps came into existence in scatteredlocations through Jewish initiative, they eventually became a reali-ty with which the partisan high command had to come to terms.These family camps were an independent and original Jewishresponse, through which thousands of men and women, old andyoung, were saved from the enemy and fmm starvation. In a fewcases, Jewish survivors of the ghettos were integrated into near-by partisan units so that they would not have to be sent into theinterior regions of Russia.During the Holocaust, partisan units, in actuality, rescued onlya relatively small number of Jews. Yet considering the tremen-dous losses of the Jewish people and the limited means of escape,we must not belittle any effective rescue. Furthermore, we mustnot forget that for many Jews the partisan struggle was an endin itself: a contribution to the general anti-Nazi resistance anda personal revenge for the murder of loved ones.“Beth Jacob School for Girls') established byAgudath Israel in Czenstochova.64CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacypressed itself in the betrayal of the Jews attempting to reach theforests in order to locate the partisans. Jews were alternately rob-bed, murdered, or turned over to the authorities resulting in theirexecution.Closely linked to this hatred were the negative opinions of Jewsregularly heard in partisan ranks, whose personnel were oftendrawn from natives of the area. In addition, many former Sovietsoldiers, especially those who escaped from prisoner-of-warcamps, were already infected with anti-Semitic opinions absorbedfrom Nazi propaganda. Partisans accused their Jewish commdes-in-arms of spoiling their relationship with the local population,thereby causing substantial damage to the cause. Some local com-manders and their superiors also had negative opinions about theJews. Thus, the Jewish partisans suffered not only from pereecu-tion and discrimination at the hands of their fellow fighters, butalso from the commanders.Reports of these conditions reached the ghettos and work campsand strengthened the hesitation of individuals and groups toescape into the forests. They struggled over the difficult personaldecision to escape the ghetto, thereby abandoning a wife, children,elderly parents, or younger siblings to an unknown fate. Thus,there were individuals and groups in the ghettos who preferredto make a stand at the time of the final Nazi assault, rather thanleave for the forests.However, faced with mass murder and destruction of the ghettos,without even an opportunity for resistance, it became clear tomany who hesitated that despite the drawbacks, the partisan-heldforest was a real alternative.A significant phenomenon, which blunted antisemitism andpresented Jewish fighters with a focus for their organizationaland military capabilities, were the Jewish national units. Mostwere formed in the partisan forests in 1943. These units werecomposed of determined and highly motivated fightere. They wereled by able commanders, almost all of whom had a strong nationalJewish consciousness. These Jewish units were imbued with richJewish traditions and made extensive use of the Yiddish language.They fostered relations with the Jews in the nearby ghettos, help-ing them to join the partisans. Then units totaling about 1,000individuals were established, including one under the leadershipof Abba Kowner, later a leader in Israel’s War for Independenceand a renowned poet. These units were soon disbanded, with theirfighters scattered throughout other units. The reason for this ac-tion by the partisan command appears to have been political.Despite the dissolution of the Jewish units, other national units,such as Ukrainians, Russians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, andMoldavians, were allowed to exist until the end of the war.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy63who had remained in the forests, and a mixture of farmers andcity dwellers, including criminals, who found sanctuary in thewoods. Their order and discipline were weak and a significantnumber were little more than bands of robbers. For example, alarge portion of these units was not subservient to the partisanhigh command and every local commander operated indepen-dently. During this period, Jews who had the necessary qualifica-tions and the desire to join the partisans had no one to whom theycould turn, due to the weak and ineffectual partisan movement.Moreover, a number of these partisan units were violently hostileto Jews.A good example of the prevailing conditions may be seen in thestory of Jews at the Tutshin (Tuczyn) ghetto, in the westernUkraine. On September 22, 1942, the German and Ukrainian,forces decided to eliminate the ghetto and destroy its inhabitants.The Jews revolted, burned their houses and used a barrage of gun-fire to cover their escape into the nearby forests. At the time ofthe breakout from the ghetto, approximately 1,000 Jews were killed.Approximately 3,000 Jews reached the forests, where they roamedabout, suffering from exposure and hunger. About 300 of themreturned to the ghetto and were immediately shot. About 1,000to 1,500 of the Jews from the ghetto were recaptured in a shorttime and suffered a fate similar to one of those who returned. Theremainder, among them husbands separated from their families,survived longer. However, most of them were ultimately killed,either when they were robbed or murdered outright, or were in-formed upon by the virulently antisemitic Ukrainian population.From the entire Jewish community only fourteen people surviv-ed. It is no wonder that many Jews preferred to take their chancesand remain in the cities rather than escape to the forests.The partisans underwent a change during the second period ofactivity — 1942-1944. During these years the supreme partisancommander in Russia exerted authority over most partisans inthe area, except for Polish and nationalistic Ukrainian units. Tlielocal commanders, certified by virtue of their ability, were placedunder the jurisdiction of the representatives of the staff of thepartisan high command. What is important for this study is thatthese changes, in all phases of the functioning of the units, cametoo late. By then, a significant portion of eastern European Jewshad already been murdered. When the Jewish multitudes werestill alive, they could not find any partisans to whom they couldflee. When partisans would accept them, there were hardly anyJews left to escape and join. While this tragic paradox may be con-sidered as the decisive factor for the nonparticipation of theJewish populace in the partisan movement, it was not the onlyone.The intense, deep-seated hatred of the local population towardsthe Jews also had a great deal of significance. This hatred ex-62CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyFirst, it must be emphasized that the Soviet partisan movementarose and operated from military and political necessities. Thesecriteria determined whether to provide refuge for the local popu-lation oppressed by the Nazis. In any event, the partisan move-ment did not, in general, delegate to itself as a special task therescue of Jews, despite the fact that the latter were the primetargets for murder by the Nazis. Jews were only allowed in par-tisan ranks if they could further the goals of the partisan move-ment. These included: conducting rear guard actions against theNazis; terrorism, with all the military force it could generate;operations to diminish the enemy’s strength; and conquering ter-ritory in prepamtion for a return to Soviet sovereignty. All of thiswas coordinated with the regular Soviet army and the politicalinstitutions of the Soviet Union. The Nazi occupation governmentand its collaborators made every effort to wipe out the partisans.They were not particular about the methods they used. Theyusually executed those suspected of collaborating in the partisanoperations. Often they executed the families of suspects after tor-turing them.The ammunition and light equipment of the partisan units couldnot compare with that of the German army and their allies. Thepartisans, nevertheless, were able to strike hard at their enemiesbecause of their flexibility and mobility, expert knowledge of theterrain and ethnicity, which permitted them to merge with thelocal population. Every partisan, moveover, was expected to bebattle-experienced, in superb physical shape, patient, trustworthyand devoted to the cause. These conditions were often waived fora candidate who brought with him a weapon.In general, the Jews were not good candidates for the partisanranks. Predominantly urban, they genemlly lacked several of theessential attributes required of a partisan: military experience,familiarity with the local terrain, typical outer appearance, abso-lute command of local languages, and other attributes that wouldpromote and facilitate relationships with the villagers, the parti-sans’ most important allies, the Jews also did not have the optionof presenting a weapon as a ticket of admission to the partisanranks. Obtaining and possessing arms was not only personallydangerous, but could lead to reprisals upon their households, rela-tives, and the entire ghetto.There were instances when Jews — from the villages, for example,with weapons and with several of the necessary qualifications,succeeded in making it to the forests. Even then, however, theywere often compelled to retrace their steps (in the best of circum-stances) because of the prevailing situation in the forests. On thispoint, it is essential to distinguish between two main periods.During the initial period of partisan activity (1941-1942), thenumber of units was minimal and military strength was ineffec-tive. The personnel consisted mostly of former Red Army soldiers.CZENSTOCHOV — Our Legsicy61Eastern European Jews in thePartisan Ranks During World War 11By Dov LevinEuropean Jews fought the Nazis in partisan groups in the forests,villages, and other non-urban locales. The terrain included manydense and large forests, wide, marshy swamps and other inac-cessible hideouts. These broad areas, covering thousands ofsquare miles were mostly conquered by the Nazi armies in theearly stages of the war. Some partisan units were under theauthority of the Polish government in exile. Most units were con-nected to the Soviet partisan movement, from whom they receiv-ed aid, directions and orders. Finally, they acceded to the Sovietcommand completely. The military and political activities of theseunits occasionally brought them near to the largest concentra-tions of the Jewish population in eastern Europe.At the outset of the war between Germany and Russia (1941-1942),this population was imprisoned in the ghettos and in the camps.Under these conditions of brutal oppression, and in constantdanger of destruction, groups of rebels organized undergroundunits to resist and to fight the Nazis. A prime goal was to bringout large numbers of Jews from the ghettos and camps to jointhe partisans. Much effort was expended in this direction, butonly 30,000 Jews actually succeeded in joining the Soviet partisanmovement. These Jews later numbered in their mnks senior offi-cers, outstanding heroes, and many who received decorations. Thepartisans — with the exception of regular armies — were one ofthe best known, strongest, and most inventive of the Europeanresistance movements and Jews participated in inflicting damageupon the Nazis. Despite this record, the question must be asked:Why, during the Holocaust, did proportionately so few Jews jointhe partisans?There is no one simple explanation for this phenomenon. Muchhas to do with the nature of the partisan struggle in easternEurope that did not allow many to join. There were also specificproblems with Jewish participation.60CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegsusyThe Resistance of CheGroup “Freihait**By A. VirsztelThe youth of the “Poale-Zion ” and “Freihait” to which Ibelonged were well organized cultural groups, carrying on educa-tional activities among the young working class people by pre-paring them in special training programs on “Hachshara”. Theywere later sent to Israel. A lot of work was done by participatingin “the League for the Working Class in Israel”, “Karen Kayemet”,“Karen Hayesod”.With the invasion of the Hitler bandits in Czenstochova, all ouractivities had to be stopped. The leaders of our group, Sz. Strausand D. Kaufman, had to leave their homes due to the threat of the“Gestapo”. I received a letter from Straus telling of his arrival inLatvia, but I have since lost contact with him.In September 1942, after the “Selection” in the large ghetto, wewere driven by armed German guards to the “Golgota”. We wereall members of “Freihait”, “Gordonia Hashomer Hatzair”, andwere very close, like one family.In the small ghetto, the movement “Freihait” helped to organizethe Kibbutz, which was split into several groups of five. One groupconsisted of the following members: W. Pressman, P. Slomnitzki,A. Szildhaus, D. Kantor, and I am the sole survivor.Many of our group escaped to fight the Nazis as partisans in theforest. We provided them with heavy boots and warm clothing.All of this was done in great fear. In the small ghetto, we organizeda collection of all types of ammunition, German uniforms, bootsand helmets. Some of the people in the ghetto were sent to“Rakov” and others to “Hasag”. My wife and I were among thosesent to “Hasag”. Conditions were unbearable — hunger, dirt,disease. My brother and I were sent to “Buchenwald” on January15th, 1945.CZENSTOCHQV - Our Lesrgcy59The Martyrdom of Leon TenenbaumAn active member of the Jewish resistance group in the smallghetto was Leon Tenenbaum. He was arrested and, after dread-ful tortures, was sent to Hasag-Apparatenbau. There all theworkers were lined up and Leon was forced, by the Gestapo, toidentify all those who were members of the resistance. All of them— together with Tenenbaum — were executed.Jacob JuzefowiczWe received a great deal of help from Jacob Juzefowicz, thefearless manager of the mechanical shop of the “Maschinenbau”.The German engineer, who appointed him as head of this division,had recognized his great talent. Nevertheless, hie was laterdeported to Auschwitz, together with a colleague, for helping aJewish couple escape from the camp. He perished in Buchenwald,along with thousands of other Jewish workers.For a long time, some Polish workers kept us informed about theworld beyond the camp. When they suddenly stopped showingup, we lost all contact to the outside world. One day, we felt thatsomething was in the air. The SS, Gestapo and Schutzpolizei wereaggressive and nervous. They chased us out, in the direction ofthe “ramp”, where railway cars waited for a deportation toBuchenwald. All those who were not on that last transport wereleft alone by the Germans. They were freed by the Allied Armies.Photo taken in Czenstochova in 1940, during the occupation.From the left: The two brothersHaftke, one of whom died in 1944in Auschwitz, the other was shotin 1948, during the uprising inthe ghetto; next to him RuvenDzialecki, who lives in Israeland Zysie Schwartz who is inthe U.S.A.58CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegBcyResistancein HASAG PelcernBy A. SztainbrecherBy THE END OF July 1943, the “small ghetto” in Czenstochova wasdemolished and liquidated. That marked the end of a hemicchapter of Jewish resistance against Hitler’s military might.The Germans succeeded in creating a tremendous panic amongthe over 4,000 “selected” Jews who were the forced labourers inthe Czenstochova concentration camp. Despair grew when thefighters of ZOB — the resistance movement — were eliminatedand when we heard about the Warsaw ghetto revolt and aboutmass liquidations in other places. Our own recent experience wasthe destruction of the large ghetto of Czenstochova. We becameconvinced that Hitler’s henchmen were ready to murder us all.They realized how much we hated them and they were determinedto break any resistance.Tortures and KillingsThe production manager, engineers and administrativeemployees, including the “Werkschutz”, participated in the tor-tures and killings of Jewish slave workers at the Hasag—Appara-tenbau. After work, the “Werkschutz” often entered the barracksto beat, torture and kill. Sometimes, they would shoot throughthe windows, especially through those of the women’s barracks.Fmm time to time, a “selection” was ordered at that work station.At the first such selection, 500 people were killed. The Unfor-tunates were first thrown into dark cellars. Then their hands werebound and they were loaded onto trucks. The trucks took themto the Jewish cemetery, where they were shot.The conditions in the “Appamtenbau” camp forced the membersof the resistance group to work in extreme secrecy. They wereorganized in cells of 5 persons, who had to be constantly on thealert.CZENSTOCHOV — Our L>eg*acy57feeling that this time I would not escape death as I did on March20th, 1943, the day when the pmfessional inteligentia was killed,the so-called “Purim Action”.The last rays had disappeared from the sky. The moon and thestars dominated the darkness of the night, bringing a mysterioussilence to the night. It was a painful night - a sleepless one withreflections, spiritual stock-taking and thoughts of death. The nextday, June 25, 1943, there was no one fmm the Nazi mgime ainundthe ghetto hospital. Around 10:00 o’clock in the morning, DomGotlieb came to see us from the ‘Arbeit Einzatz” to calm us downand to tell us that Bernaixl Kurland was doing everything possibleto free us. The reason for our arrest was not known.At noon my brother, Jacob, came with food. He told us thatTzoport told him that if Degenhart will not come at 3:00 o’clock,then we will be released from prison. Time passed slowly and,with each passing hour, there were thoughts of suicide anddestroyed hope. It was now five o’clock in the evening. We heardloud shooting. We had no idea what was happening. The police-man on guard said only that there was something bad happen-ing. He did not want to tell us anything else. We later learned thatfighting had bmken out between the underground movement andthe Nazis.On Saturday, the 26th of June, the sadistic Degenhart and Roncame to us and sarcastically asked, “What are you doing here?Go back to your work.” Seveml minutes later, the Chief of the Gen-darmes came in, holding an automatic machine gun in his handand started to argue with Degenhart. He wanted to kill us. Wefound out that Marisia Rotstein was killed at the hospital. Thefour of us were released. The liquidation of the small ghettostarted. There were bloody scenes of killing. Loads of heavytrucks filled with people were sent to the Jewish cemetery. Men,women and children were killed.At this selection, I was with a group of women who were sent towork in “Hasag Pelcern”. This was my last encounter with themonster Degenhart.It was later learned that Degenhart was sent to Greece to fightwith the partisans. The partisans were informed who Degenhartwas and they killed him during a raid.56CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyMy Last Encounter with theCold'Blooded Murderer, DegenhartOri^nally written in Yiddish by Estera EpsteinIt was early summer of 1943. There was a beautiful blue andclear sky. The sun was spreading its warm rays and this createdan atmosphere of happiness for all living human beings.Tired after a hard day’s work together with the other forcedlaborers, we were ready to leave “Hasag Pelcern” and go to thesmall ghetto. The procedure of returning to the ghetto for theevening was complicated and involved an “Appell” to count all thepeople who were going to the ghetto, under the strict guidanceof the “Werkschutz” director, Klem, and the other guards of theNazi regime.On that particular day, the “Appell” was not being held as usualin the court of the factory. Much to everyone’s surprise, Degen-hart had arrived and started to call out names. Each person whosename was called had to step out and report to Degenhart. The firstname he called was mine, then Szmulewicz and Davidowich. Alltogether, eight women were called. We were investigated. Fourwomen were told to go back in line. The other four were detained.Those held back were Marisia Epstein, Szmulewicz, Davidowiczand myself. On that same day, M. Wodzislawski and J. Winter werearrested. Both were sent to jail and later killed.Degenhart told me that we, the four women, will be interrogatedtomorrow morning by the “Gestapo”, and later will be returnedto “Hasag Pelcern”. For tonight, we had to stay in the ghettohospital.In the meantime, the day shift was escorted to work and we wereleft in the hands of the barbaric Gendarme and “Meister”Hochberg. They forced us to run several kilometers while theyfollowed on bicycles. When we arrived at the small ghetto, we weretaken prisoner by the Polish police officer Paruzel and the Com-mandant of the Jewish ghetto police Parasol. We were taken tothe ghetto hospital of Yascrovska Street. Marisia Botstein, thewife of Engineer Samek Rotstein, was also there.

WagaIn November 1942, the Nazis formed the small ghetto, and over5,000 Jewish people were transferred to this small ghetto. It waslocated in the filthiest, poorest part of the city. That was wherethe remnant of the Jews was confined, after those in the largeghetto had been decimated. In the morning, they were driven toforced labour and in the evening they returned exhausted anddepressed.At that time, the leader of the Kibbutz, my friend Aryeh (who waslater killed in the forest near Czenstochova) came to see me at mycarpentry shop on Alee 14. He told me that my shop would be thetransit place from the small ghetto to the train station and thereturn. This shop on Alee 14 was located outside the ghetto andwas open to Aryans only, as were several shops run by the Jewishartisan group who worked for the German clientele.Each day I saw many people who came through my house fromthe “outside world”. I can remember those faces of the young menand women who were, at first, devastated to go outside the ghetto,but who later returned as courageous resistance fighters. By theend of 1942 I was told that there would be a meeting in my shop.At that time a young gentile fellow, who gave his password toenter, introduced himself as a delegate from Zarki where therewas a Kibbutz. My friend Aryeh entered with a young man whointroduced himself as Aniek from Warsaw. Later, I was told thatthis was Eliezer Geler. The gathering lasted an entire day. It wasdecided that we would be ready for armed resistance. At the endof January 1943, my friend Moitek M. Zilberberg came to my shopwith a small package of revolvers.In March of 1943, the shop on Alee 14 was liquidated and theartisan shops were transferred to the small ghetto. There, I tookover the carpentry and locksmith shops, equipped withmechanically-operated machines.The resistance movement built part of the ammunition in thefoundry of “Vulkan” and smuggled it into the ghetto. When I wasCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy53After the MassacreAn imaginary conversationAfter the first deportation of Czenstochova Jews fmm. thelarge ghetto to the gas chambers, Commander Degenhart oixlemdthe streets cleared of the dead bodies.The job of removing the dead was given to a gmup of young menwho were told to dig a large hole on a vacant lot on Kavia Street.Degenhart ordered that there they should dispose of “thegarbage”. Several hundred victims, shot during the “Aktion”, wereloaded onto horse drawn wagons and taken to the mass gi'ave. OneGerman policeman, armed with an automatic weapon, and aJewish policeman, with a rubber stick, were assigned to accom-pany each transport. They were to keep order during the silentfuneral procession and to urge the men to do their work faster.The Jewish policeman carried out his task as he was ordered. Heturned his nose in the direction of the wind to avoid the putridsmell of the corpses. All day long bodies were gathered fromhomes, basements, bunkers and fields. As he was walkingalongside the wagons, something caught this policeman’s eye. Henoticed the corpse of a young woman lying face up. She appearedto be alive and ready to free herself from the dead around her. Herblack hair dragged along the blood-spattered road.The young policeman became enchanted with her beauty and, asif in a dream, he began to communicate with her. He imaginedher speaking to him. “Where are you taking me?” her open eyesseemed to ask. “You are a ruthless human being, you have no pity!You are a shameless servant of these murderers. Would you everavenge the killers of your people?”As he became deeper involved in that imaginary conversation, hewas brutally awakened by the shouts of the German guard. “Moveon! Faster! Schneller! Get rid of that garbage.” The wagon beganto shake and the head of the young woman moved from side toside. The Jewish policeman walked faster. Closer and closer camethe mass grave on Kavia Street where the dead beauty would joinhundreds of other nameless victims.Soon earth covered the grave, while the murderers continued theirbloody game. Their victims’ silent screams of pain and horrorcontinues to be heard throughout this, supposedly civilized,20th century.52CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyPolak’s place, whom he considered his friend, but who betmyedhim to the Gestapo.

Thanks to him, they are alive today — amongthem, Kurland’s son and Brener’s daughter.The Jewish resistance movement, “ZOB”, had the best oppor-tunity to be in contact with the outside world through the Meble-Lager. Birenzweig was well aware of that.Unfortunately, this only door to freedom was eventually closed.Birenzweig, his wife and his elderly mother, paid a high price forhis unselfishness.Mrs. Hanka Kongeretsky, with her two children, was hidden inone of the bunkers. Her little boy often escaped from the hidingplace and his mother was unable to stop him. One day,while out of the hiding place, he was found by the Germans and,scared of their threats, he pointed to the bunker. As a result,Hanka, her children and others in that hiding place, were shot.On March 19, 1943, Degenhart, with his gang of murderers,accidentally entered the room where the partisans held theirmeetings. During their search, they came upon some ammuni-tion. In reprisal, six wonderful members of the Czenstochovayouths were killed. They were Monek Flamenbaum, AlekHerszberg, Yerszy Rosenblat, Henek Richter, Yanek Krause andSzlamek Shein.It appears that the Germans had received a tip from an informerabout the activities in the Meble-Lager. On the second day ofShavuot, 1943, the German police (Schupo/Schutzpolizei) arrived,together with the hangman Degenhart. They came with a pre-pared plan to liquidate the Meble-Lager and all its work places.Degenhart ordered Machel Birenzweig to get his family. Machelunderstood what that meant and left, as if to obey the order. But,he disappeared. As the Germans could not find him, they killedhis mother. His wife, Hanka, was taken away on a truck in thedirection of the jail of “Zavodie”. Pinchas Birenzweig was beaten,had his teeth knocked out and was ordered to remain. He was toldthat they would kill everyone if he attempted to escape. Whilehunting for his brother, they forgot about Pinchas who left withsome others, went to the small ghetto where he hid with a groupof partisans. Using false papers, he later escaped to Germany,from where he was, eventually, liberated.Machel Birenzweig remained in hiding inside the Meble-Lagerand the Germans were unable to find him.

KIELDuring the deportotion and liquidation of the Jewish populationof Czenstochova, the name on everyone’s lips was Machel Biren-zweig. There were many working groups in the ghetto; but theonly one to be spared from deportations was the “Meble-Lager”,which was under the supervision of Machel Birenzweig.Machel was a very compassionate man. During the time that thisworking group was operational, he and his family were constantlyin great danger. He was in danger of losing his life because of hisdedication to helping others. Birenzweig practiced silentresistance against the Nazi oppressors. The Meble-Lager con-sisted of many different work places. It had a separate transportdepartment which had a permit to travel all over the city withoutinterference. That whole group was distinguished by exceptionalheroism inspired by Birenzweig.Their assignment was to remove the furniture from the Jewishhomes after liquidation of the large ghetto. When their workingparties arrived at these homes, they often found children whoseparents had been deported. These children were then hidden inboxes and cupboards at the Meble-Lager. To do that requiredsuperhuman courage. It was like condemning oneself to death.The two brothers, Machel and Pinchas Birenzweig, organized aweb of bunkers in strict secrecy. To accomplish this, one had tohave a team one could trust completely. In the beginning, therewas a problem to get food for the hidden children. Such food hadto be smuggled in. Many people, who wanted to find refuge on thenon-Jewish side of the city, came to the Meble-Lager, the onlyplace where one could plan an escape. Birenzweig was the per-son who helped and protected them all from certain death.Each day, when the working group from the small ghetto arrivedat the Meble-Lager, they would pass a German named Lange. Hewas always standing at the entrance. Everybody knew Lange asthe “Chazin” who was responsible for the whole place and theworking group.

This is the debt we owe to the free-dom fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto, and in many other Ghettoswho conquered despair and with a Jewish heroism that has nopeer took to the bunkers to kill their killers. Their legacy to theJewish people is our resolve that the Holocaust shall never berepeated.

But this is a merefraction of the story. Ask any survivor who went through the Holo-caust experience, and he will tell you that there is yet much moreto tell. Each survivor has something more to add. The completestory has not yet been told. Perhaps it never can be.Now fifty years later, we are filled with the shattering realizationthat there is no substitute for our losses; for those Jews, for thosecommunities, for the houses of learning, the libraries, syna-gogues, the arts, the professional and scientific achievements.There is no substitute for European Jewry, for its people, for itsYiddishkeit, for its treasurers. Their almost total absence is notonly a loss for our generation of survivors but a loss for mankindand for Jews everywhere, for generations to come.We still cannot free ourselves of the sadness and sorrow that hasbecome a part of our lives. Only now do we begin to grasp the fullsignificance of what happened, the full scope and magnitude ofsix million brothers, sisters, and children . . . gone.The calculated visiousness of the executioner, the helplessnessof the doomed, the passivity of the bystander - all these lie beyondour comprehension — fascination with death, the victims withhope, the survivors’ testimony. A new vocabulary needs to be invested to describe the events.We cannot allow the next generation not to know of their past.We cannot let the memory of our Kedoshim die with us the sur-vivors. Therefore, as it is by the grace of G-d that we were givento live, we must resolve that we must prepare the future genera-tions to know of our tragic and heroic past.We must perpetuate the memory of Six Million Kedoshim.

We remember the oneand a half million Jewish children who were slaughtered andCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy47Wladka’s frequent trips and those of two other girls, contact withthe Warsaw Ghetto underground was established again.Encouraged by the revived fighting spirit, some members of theWarsaw ZOB favored an open revolt in both camps, promising tosupply weapons. However, the Czenstochova ZOB was opposed tothe suggestion. The mounting terror and the frequent searchesof Polish workers who would risk smuggling weapons into theHasag camps militated against the idea. A plan to escape was alsoabandoned because it was practically impossible to reach thepartisan groups in the woods. Moreover, the decree of collectiveresponsibility as applied by the Germans restrained the ZOB com-mand from sending out its members. The absence of one usuallyled to the execution of scores of others.The fact that their number could not be enlarged limited theactivities of the Jewish partisans in the woods to attacks on minorGerman posts and on Polish constables who collaborated with theGermans, and to obtaining food and ammunition. Lacking thenecessary manpower and fighting equipment to undertake large-scale attacks against the Germans, the Jewish partisans decided,therefore, to contact the Polish partisans and jointly fight thecommon enemy.In the Konyetspol woods, there operated, at that time, a group ofthe A. K. (Armia Krajowa) named Orzel (Eagle). Unaware of theirpolitical affiliation, the Jews considered them as their naturalallies and suggested common armed action. At the appointed dayand place of the first meeting, a group of Jews, under the com-mand of Kuba Ripshtayn, waited for the representatives of Orzel.They came armed with machine guns and revolvers. Kuba and hiscomrades, without suspecting anything, greeted the approachingOrzel men with friendly gestures and, to prove their friendly feel-ings, did not even open their holsters. But when the distance be-tween the two groups was narrowed, the men from Orzel fired onthe Jews. Only one, the wounded Shidlovski, succeeded in escap-ing. The rest of the Jews were killed by the Polish Fascists. Thiswas not the only treacherous act the Polish Fascists committedagainst the Jews in the Konyetspol woods. These Poles, togetherwith Polish police, also massacred another Jewish partisan group.The situation of the remaining Jewish partisans became more andmore dangerous. They were forced to leave their fortified hidingplaces and live in the open woods. Fortunately, a Polish peasantnamed Romanow, came to their aid, giving them a warm meal andbread at night. Another Jewish ZOB group joined a left-wingPolish partisan unit which operated in the Konyetsp)ol area, underthe leadership of the Pole Hanysh. The Hanysh unit received theJews in a warm and friendly manner. With these progressivePoles, the Jews could demonstrate their courage and share theirfighting abilities.46CZENSTOCHOV - Our Lee^acyto the group slated for deportation. When the German officerRohn resumed the selection, Fishelevitch attempted to shoot him,but his revolver jammed at first, and Rohn suffered only a slightarm wound. Fishelevitch then fought the attacking policemenwith his bare fists until he was shot dead. Meanwhile Feyner at-tacked another officer, Soport, with his knife. Feyner was alsomortally wounded.In reprisal, the Germans picked twenty-five of the assembled Jewsat random and executed them on the spot. About 300 men andwomen, among them some ZOB members, were taken to thePblish Police precinct. The ZOB command did everything possibleto rescue their comrades. They succeeded in smuggling in to themfiles and other tools with which to cut the prison bars, but theirrapid transfer to the nearby city Radomsko destroyed the hopeof a prison break. They did, however, make use of the tools laterwhen they were deported to extermination centers. They cut thebars on the cattle cars and together with other deportees leapedfrom the train. Most of them were shot down by the escorting gen-darmes or caught on their way back to the ghetto. Only a fewreturned.The acquisition of weapons was always a dangerous and costlyundertaking. In December, 1942, M. Ferleger, commander ofNadrzeczna 66, was surprised by a German policeman as he wasabout to accept some weapons outside the ghetto. He knockeddown the German and escaped, but was later caught and takento Gestapo headquarters where he was tortured and shot.Zoska, the girl courier, suffered a similar fate. One day when shewas bringing weapons from Warsaw, she was followed by an in-former who threatened to report her to the Czenstochova police.Zoska attacked him, but was soon surrounded by a group ofGermans. In the ensuing struggle, she was shot.The Germans proceeded with the liquidation of the ghetto, kill-ing scores on the spot and executing hundreds of men, women,and children at the Jewish cemetery.The ZOB in Hasag and in the WoodsAfter the liquidation of the Small Ghetto, the connections betweenthe various remaining ZOB units were cut off. There were threegroups in the woods around Konyetspol. Others were in the laborcamps, Hasag—Eisenhiitte (Hasag steel mill in Rakov) andHasag—Apparatenbau.At this point, contact with the underground movement in theWarsaw Ghetto was also temporarily disrupted. It was not untilsome weeks later that Wladka, a liaison officer of the WarsawCoordinating Committee, came to Czenstochova, made contactwith groups in the woods, and through them, was put in touchwith some ZOB members in the two Hasag camps. Thanks toCZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy45before. Hardships in the ghetto increased; contact with the ZOB(Jewish Fighting Organization) in Warsaw had lessened and onlyoccasionally did couriers of the Polish underground in Warsawbring information about life in other ghettos and instructions.One such message brought the news about the mass deportationsfrom the Warsaw Ghetto (summer, 1942) without the deporteeshaving knowledge of what awaited them. This same note also con-tained the warning that Czenstochova would meet the same fateas other ghettos and must therefore prepare for open resistance.A meeting was set for September 21, 1942 (Yom Kippur), withJewish representatives of the PPR (Polish Workers Party), theBund, the left wing of the Poale-Zion, the General Zionists andits youth movement, and of non-affiliated groups. A member ofthe Warsaw ZOB was to have participated in the deliberations.However,when the first two representatives, Brener and Rozyne,arrived at the meeting place in the offices of the TOZ (Society forthe Protection of Health), they were detained and severely beatenby German police. They were later released, thanks to a deal be-tween Jewish teamsters and the policemen for whom theyworked, but as a result of this mishap the planned meeting didnot take place.The next day the Germans and their Polish Fascist helpersmarched into the Ghetto and began the deportation round-ups.There was no resistance on the part of the Jews. The fightingorganization which was about to become a reality had not comeinto being. Many of its potential members were deported toTreblinka and later perished in the uprising there in which theyparticipated. Only a few of the original initiators remained and,together with older youths, continued to organize fighting groupswhich became active in the so-called Small Ghetto. Some of theresistance groups remained after the deportation from the LargeGhetto until its liquidation.The first act of armed resistance took place on January 4, 1943.It was poorly organized. The German police captain Degenharthad ordered all Jews working in the ghetto that day to assembleon the square. Present were Mendel Fishelevitch, a staff memberof the Fighting Organization, who had a revolver; his friend,Isadore Feyner, who had a knife; and some members of the groupNadrzeczna 66. The few pistols the Fighting Organization hadwere taken out that day by members who were on specialassignments outside the ghetto. Armed with only one revolver anda knife, the fighters after long deliberation, decided to assembleat the square. There an “action” was in progress. The old womenand children were selected for deportation. The approachingmembers of the Fighting Organization and other young men andwomen were immediately surrounded by gendarmes and driven44CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe Story of Jewish Resistancein the Ghetto of CzenstochovaBy Dr. William Glicksman (For my son, Allen)[Dr. Glicksman is a survivor of the Holocaust. He was arrested by the Gestapoand deported to Auschwitz and from there evacuated to Dachau, where he wasliberated by the American Third Army on April 30, 1945. He came to the U.S.A.in May, 1946, and resides with his family in Philadelphia.Dr. Glicksman — teacher, lecturer, and historian —has written extensively on theHolocaust theme. Among his important monographs are: Social Differentiationsin the German Concentration Camps, The Function of the Jewish Police in theGhetto of Czenstochova, and Aspects of the Economic and Social Life of the Jewsin the Ghettos.He is also the author of In the Mirror of Literature, a portrayal of the economiclife of the Jews in Poland as it is reflected in Yiddish literature (1914—1939). Cur-rently, Dr. Glicksman teaches at Dropsie College in Philadelphia, and is a Fellowof the Diaspora Research Institute at the Tel-Aviv University.The account that follows is based, in addition to the author's personal experiencesin the Czenstochova Ghetto, on a variety of sources dealing with his subject, par-ticularly the works of L. Brener, among them Resistance and Extermination inthe Ghetto of Czenstochova (Jewish Historical Institute of Warsaw).]The idea of a resistance movement was conceived in the veryfirst months of the war when the leaders of various political par-ties, as well as politically non-affiliated young men and women,reorganized themselves into cells for the purpose of secretly con-tinuing their activities. Their ultimate goal was the creation ofa fighting organization. These groups met at cemeteries duringfunerals, in old-age homes, and in social welfare institutions, towork out plans for such illegal activities as education for thechildren, maintenance of a library, and the publication and dis-tribution of periodicals.In order to coordinate the illegal work of the various parties, inter-group conferences were held from time to time. At one such con-ference, in August, 1941, the question of organizing a unifiedresistance movement was brought up again. Unfortunately, dif-ferences of opinion among the members prevented its formation.But early in 1942 the combination of a number of factors madethe creation of a fighting organization even more imperative thanC2^NSTOCHOV ~ Our Legacy43JUNE 16. 1943At 7:00 o’clock in the morning everyone in the ghetto was orderedto meet outside because Degenhart and his officers, Ron, Verner,etc., were making a “selection”. Hundreds of Jews were arrestedand taken to the Jewish cemetery where they were murdered. Theothers were loaded onto trucks and sent to the ammunition fac-tories. More than 800 Jewish people were murdered in Czensto-chova during the two day action.JUNE 26. 1943The Germans believed that many Jews were hidden in bunkers.An amnesty was declared for those who would give themselvesup by Monday, the 28th of June. The result of this trick — a massgrave of 200 women, children and elderly who were present onTuesday, the 29th of June. At 5:00 a.m., the massacre took placein the cemetery. At the execution, the people had to undress andhad to walk in pairs to the open grave as one gunshot served tokill two people and their bodies fell into the grave.JULY 20. 1943The houses in the small ghetto were blown up with dynamite. A“selection” took place at the work places. That day, 70 more peoplewere murdered, including the Jewish police and their families.This Monument was erected in 1945,on the Jewish Cemetery in Czenstochov.A collective Tombstone, with 127 people who were murdered onPurim, of March 27, 1943. Among them were Professionals,members of the Judenrat, men, women and children. The familyKopinski lost many members of their family that night.42CZENSTOCHOV ~ Our LegacyForty thousand Jews passed before the tyrant Degenhart, “YemakShemoi”, during the three weeks of “selection”. Present as wellduring the selection was the Greneral of the SS and Pohce Chiefof the Radomer district, Greneral Betcher. Szmuel Groldstein, whohad been for the past 18 years the “Preses”, that is the chairmanof the Jewish community of Czenstochov, a prominent “Mizrachi”leader and participant in all of the Jewish institutions, attemptedsuicide. Wearing the Talis and Tifillin, he jumped out of the win-dow of his second floor apartment, but was stopped by a Germanguard and beaten. He was sent to Treblinka.All the Jews were beaten and taken under heavy guard to thewaiting cattle trains. The prominent Orthodox Jew, Ytche MeirKrell, walked barefoot and with dignity “. . . and this is the willof the Almighty, brothers and sisters,” he called out. With himin this transport to Treblinka were J.H. Zitnicki, A.H. Shipper,Zeligfeld and Blumenkrantz.THE SMALL GHETTOOne of the oldest and dirtiest parts of the city, near the RiverWarta, was enclosed with barbed wire. A few streets in that areabecame the “small ghetto”. Workers were selected and threaten-ed with death should they fail to come to work each day. Theymarched to work under the watchful eyes of the “Workschutz”police. After 12 hours of work under unbearable conditions, theyreturned in the evening to the sleeping holes in the small ghetto.SATURDAY, ON THE EVE OF PURIM, MARCH 20. 1943The Nazi Degenhart ordered what was called the “prisonerexchange to Palestine”. The Judenrat, including doctors and other“intelligencia”, together with their families, were gathered in ahouse outside the barbed wire of the small ghetto. All the pris-oners exchange groups were ordered onto military trucks andtaken to the Jewish cemetery where they were all murdered. Onthis day, 127 people perished. Some of the executioners were the“Schutzpolizei”, Schott, Klufaz, Esof Szemil, Uvkelbad, Hantke.THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SMALL GHETTO. JUNE 6th. 1943Several police cars arrived at about 4:00 a.m., and the small ghettowas attacked by heavy gun fire and the spray of machine gunbullets. The people fled to the underground tunnel. Degenhartordered hand grenades to be thrown. That attack lasted over anhour. Many people were killed, and those who survived wereloaded onto trucks and taken away to be executed.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy41SCHOOLSSchooling was a special problem for Jewish children. Schoolsexisted in secrecy, lead by Dr. Merring and other teachers.Under these terrible conditions, much was accomplished. Two ofthe leaders, Mr. Roziner and Dr. Walberg, of TOZ, were killed inJune, 1943, upon orders of Degenhart.APRIL 9th, 1941Fbr Czenstochover Jews, the large ghetto became a reality on thisday. Theoretically, the boundaries of the ghetto went from the railbridge to as far as Warta Bridge. The left side extended to KaviaStreet. The house. Alee 14 Wilsama, Pilsudskiego, and a part ofthe Strazacka Street, remained outside the ghetto.The Jewish police were posted at the gates. Signs in Polish andGerman on the Aryan side of the ghetto announced the following:“Because of disease, entrance is strictly prohibited/*There was also another sign in German, Polish and Hebrew, whichread:''Death penalty for crossing the ghetto.**To outsiders, it looked like the Jewish ghetto was a self-rulingcommunity but, in reality, it was used as a means to keep all theJews in one location and under guard, a plan that was later usedin the “Final Solution’’.THE CONFISCATION OF FUR COATS, DECEMBER 24, 1941By the end of 1941, a new decree declared that Jews were forbid-den to own furs, a crime punishable by the death penalty. In thecourse of 48 hours, five railway truck loads of furs were collectedand delivered to the Nazis.WORK SHOPS ORGANIZED, 1942With the help of Dr. Michael Wychert, the Chairman of the JewishSocial Service, the Judenrat organized work shops in order to givethe Jews the opportunity to earn a living in all types of workplaces. Permission for such work facilities had to be obtained, andthe Jews were charged large sums of money for that privilege.In the meantime, over 500 Jewish workers were used in the largeammunition factories of Hugo Schneider, Hasag Pelcem, “Warta”,“Czenstochovianka” and “Rockov”.SEPTEMBER 22, 1942In the early morning, after Yom Kippur, at 3:00 a.m., the destruc-tion of the Czenstochover Jewish community began, when all thestreet lights were turned on so that it became difficult to hide.40CZENSTOCHOV - Our legacyTHE ELECTION OF A “JUDENRAT”The first day of “Hoi Homod Sukkoth”, Leon Kopinsky wasordered by the Gestapo to organize a committee, an Eldest-Rath,of 24 people who would be responsible for the Jewish communityof Czenstochova. A meeting was called and sixty representativesof many influential, social, public and political organizations metand chose a “Judenrat” of 24 people.DECEMBER 15, 1939All the Jews were ordered to wear white arm bands with the blueimprint of the Star of David on their left arm. Jews were notallowed on the trains or any other public transport.DECEMBER 24. 1939At about 7:00 p.m., a fire broke out in the “shul” on GaribaldiStreet and burned it to the ground. Destroyed were the TorahScrolls and the splendid library of the Judaic Institute of thesynagogue. The spiritual leader was Dr. H.Z. Hirsh berg. At thesame time, a pogrom was organized by the Poles of Czenstochova,which plundered the shops and broke the windows in the Jewishsection of the city.JANUARY, 1940There was a night raid, organized by the Gendarmery officer Am-baras and his group. The men and women in the Jewish sectionwere ordered to go out into the new Market Place in the bitter cold.There they stood for several hours. They were then ordered to goto a local school where they were physically searched for gold.That same month, there was a new law regarding forced labourfor all the Jews. All men between the ages of 14 and 60, includingconverts to Christianity, had to sign up for forced labour for theGermans. The “Judenrat” were required to supply a certainnumber of people to do labour. The raids continued and peoplewere also taken off the street.By 1940 Jews were not allowed to own factories and businesses,previously run by Jews, were now taken over by German‘ ‘Treuhanders ’ ’!Under these unbearable conditions, the refugees arrived fromKrakow, Plock, Bodzancv and Lodz. They organized “the Jewishself-ruling system” comprised of police, courts, health office andbread cards.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leffacy39liksix people.

The guards directed us to a room and at the table were threeGestapo officers. After some formalities, one of the officers toldus that, in fact, they were supposed to kill us for what we did tothe German army when they were invading Czenstochova, butthat they still had lots of time to kill us. We were placed underarrest, but were told that we were to be released for two days. Wewere asked for the names of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman andTreasurer of our group.ROSH HASHANA. 2nd DAY. 1939We were told that the German authorities had arrested 100 Jewsfrom another city We made contact with them, and we learnedthat they were arrested on the highways and most were from Lodz.There were no women among them. We gave them medical sup-plies received from the druggist H. Neufeld, with the help of CesiaKozak. The six arrested Jews had to report to the Gestapo everysecond day. They spent their time organizing a kitchen to providefree meals for the people of the community.The old city “shul” was destroyed by the Poles during those tendays around Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.SEPTEMBER 30. 1939Every day there were new edicts. Jews were not allowed to possessmore than 100 zloty. The balance of their money and all theirvaluables, including jewellery, had to be deposited in the bank. TheCity Hall operated under a temporary City President, A. Belka,a Volksdeutscher resident of Czenstochova. He was arrogant andbrutal towards the Jews. There existed also a very bad relation-ship between the Jews and Poles of the cityIt was, therefore, decided to send a delegation to Bishop Kobina.In that group were Neufeld, Ziriker, Eng. Levkowicz and Dr. Safer.Unfortunately, when that delegation went to see Bishop Kobina,they found that he was under “house arrest”.38CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyA Diary of Sad DaysBy David KoniecpolerTranslated from Czenst€>chover book, published in IsraelSEPTEMBER 1, 1939The Polish army and the police left the city of Czenstochova andpanic spread. Thousands of Jews abandoned their homes, takingonly their most important possessions, on the run with nodestination. Hundreds more Jews from the neighbouring areascame into the city, people of all ages, trying to escape the ap-proaching German army.SEPTEMBER 3. 1939Yesterday, Saturday, we saw the first military units marching intothe city, and today there are larger groups of military units. TheJewish pKDpulation was in the streets.SEPTEMBER 4, 1939Early in the morning, there were rumours that the “Gestapo” hasarrived. At about 11:00 a.m., continuous rifle shots could be heard.The Gestapo were searching buildings and chasing people out oftheir homes. Men were forced into the streets where they wereeither shot or taken away. At the churches, factories and opensquares, hundreds were ordered to lie, face down, on the groundand rifles were fired into the air.These events continued until Wednesday, the 6th of September.A group of about 400 people made up of both Jews and Pbles werebeaten and tortured. There were dead people and dead horses andcows lying together in the gutters.Many Jews were rounded up and taken to jails and militarybarracks. Stores were vandalized and Jevsdsh homes were ran-sacked. Men were dragged from their homes never to return.JEWISH NEW YEAR (Erev Rosh Hashana), 1939M.

It was closed on January 16, 1945, and the workers weresent to the Buchenwald and Ravensbrtick camps. The largestcamp in the Czenstochova area was HASAG Pelcern, which func-tioned from June 1943 until January 16, 1945. This was a muni-tions factory employing, at any given time, about five thousandJews, from Poland, Germany, Austria and Bohemia. Finally, therewas an average of three thousand Jews working in the munitionsfactory of Warta and Czenstochovianka.In December 1942, the Zydowska Organizacia Bojowa (JewishFighting Organization — ZOB) created a resistance unit inCzenstochova, with some 300 participants. They maintained con-tact with the Warsaw center. In January 1943, this group, underthe leadership of Mendel Fiszlewicz, offered armed resistance toa German Aktion. During the clash, 251 Jews were killed; the restwere deported to Radomsko and from there to Treblinka. Thereprisals that followed included the murder of 127 of the Jewishintelligentsia, and 250 children and elderly people. In otherresistance groups, there were two relatively large units of par-tisans, who were killed by Polish rightist partisans, and severalsmall units that joined the leftist Polish partisans. On June 25,1943, another ZOB group tried to resist the liquidation of thesmall ghetto. When the Soviet army liberated Czenstochova, therewere still some 5,000 Jews in the area. In June 1946, 2,167 Jewswere living in Czenstochova. After the Kielce pogrom on July 4,many of them joined the Berhia for Palestine.Fbrced labour group in the large ghetto36CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyPersecution of Che JewsIn CzenstochovaExcerpt from: Gutman - **Encyclopedm of the Holocaust**The Germans entered Czenstochova on Sunday, September 3,1939, the third day of the war, and persecution of its Jews beganat once. More than 300 Jews were killed on the following day,which became known as “Bloody Monday”. On September 16, aJudenrat (Jewish Council) was formed, headed by Leon Kopinski.Confiscation of Jewish property and household effects, beatings,mockery, and degradation went on incessantly. In August 1940,1,000 young Jews were rounded up and sent to the Cicchanowforced-labor camps; very few survived.A ghetto was established on April 9, 1941, by order of theStadthauptmann (city commissioner), SS-BrigadefiihrerDr. Richard Wendler, in the eastern, old part of the city. The ghettowas sealed off on August 23. Some twenty thousand Jews fromother cities (Lodz, Flock, Krakow) and villages were sent to theCzenstochova ghetto, which eventually held more than forty-eightthousand persons. The main places of work outside the ghettowere the German Metallurgie military factories on Krotka Street.In preparation for the forthcoming liquidation of the ghetto, inMay 1942, the Germans seized and killed the Jewish social,cultural and political activists. Large-scale Aktionen began onSeptember 22 and lasted until October 8. In each deportation,some eight thousand Jews were packed into sixty freight cars. Atotal of thirty-nine thousand Jews were sent in this way to theTreblinka extermination camp. Elderly people, in the home for theaged, and the children in the orphanage were killed on the spot.About two thousand Jews managed to escape or to hide in the city.After the deportations, the northeastern part of the ghetto, calledthe “small ghetto”, held some five thousand able-bodied Jews withskills or professions. On September 2, a privately-owned Germanmunitions factory (Apparatenbau) belonging to the HASAG net-work, was established in the suburb of Stradom. This forced-laborcamp existed for two years, and a total of three thousand Jewsfrom Poland, Germany and Austria passed through it.

PERETZ FOLK TALESDrawing byYossel BergnerCZENSTOCHOV ~ Our Le/sracy33A young farmer girl noticed the blond Jewish boy dressed in hiswhite shirt. She stared at him for a long time, thinking what abeautiful child he was. Suddenly, the impulse overcame her towant to, together with her father, kidnap the boy. They offered mybrother a few candies and he let the farmer girl pick him up tosit beside her on the wagon. She embraced him, smiling happily.The old farmer was in a very good mood, pleased that he was tak-ing home such a good bargain. After a year or two, the boy wouldgrow up to be a good Christian shepherd for his sheep and cattle.By chance, our cousin, Gitele, wanted to buy some potatoes forPassover from the same farmer. Suddenly she noticed heryoungest cousin. Aunt Deborah’s son, Avraham Szlomele. He wassitting on the lap of a farmer girl. She went over to the wagon.Gitele reached to take him off the wagon but the farmer and hiswife started yelling that the boy was their grandson. The farmerlifted his fist in anger and was about to drive away. “This is myaunt’s son’’, Gitele shouted. “Give me back the child.” A largecrowd was gathering, Christians and Jews alike. The air was verytense. The shouting became louder. “Poles, please save a Catholicsoul from the Jews.” Suddenly a giuup of people started vandaliz-ing Jewish stands at the market. Mothers were running homewith their children. Stores closed. The more courageous Jewsstarted circling the wagon. They did not allow the farmer to leave.In desperation, Gitele ran inside the church. She asked the priestfor help. Meanwhile, outside the fighting continued in the market.This was a good opportunity to fight the Jews.After a very long time of hesitation, the priest finally came out-side. The gentiles removed their hats in respect. He asked whatthe problem was and announced that he would look for signs, toknow if the child was Jewish. He took the child, held him for awhile, then he removed Avraham’s pants. The crowd was silent.Everyone’s eyes were turned towards the priest who lifted up thechild in the air. “I want everyone to see that this boy is circum-cized and does not belong to our religion”, he declared. With thathe handed the child over to Gitele.When Gitele’s mother came running in fear, she found Avrahamin the arms of a smiling Gitele. She hugged and kissed him, withtears running down her face.On that Sabbath, prayers were said in all Czenstochoversynagogues for the double miracle, a Jewish child saved fromconversion and, G-d forbid, a pogrom against the Jews of Czen-stochova averted.32CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legsu^A MiracleOriginally written in Yiddish by Sarah Hamer-JacklynSince my mother became the sole family provider, she would goto the market in Czenstochova every Tuesday and Friday to sellher glassware at one of the stands. On those days, her youngestson, Avraham Szlomele, was left to take care of himself.One Tuesday, a week before Passover, Avraham decided to visithis mother at the market. It was a long distance from his house,but he knew the way, having walked many times to the marketwith her. Avraham walked along Warshever Street but, insteadof turning to the right, he went straight ahead towards the Churchof the Holy Zygmunt.Avraham forgot all about his mother as he walked around so manywagons loaded with all kinds of food. There were so many horsesbeside each wagon and people were coming and going and thenoise was very loud.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy31A Jewish resistance group was soon organized in the ghetto. Itrepresented all Jewish political parties. The members of thisorganization were active outside the ghetto. On January 4, 1943,the fighting group “66”, headed by Mendel Fishelevich and IzioFeiner, attacked two Nazi officers at the ghetto entrance, Rohnand Tsopot, with a knife and a handgun. As a reprisal, theGermans executed 27 Jews.On Purim of March 20, 1943, Commandant Degenhart, Head ofthe Police and SS, deceitfully gathered all intelligentsia — doc-tors, lawyers, engineers, members of the Judenrat and theirfamilies — at the square near the ghetto and told them that theywere going to be transported to Palestine. Instead, they were ledto the Jewish cemetery where 127 men, women and children wereshot in cold blood and buried.On June 25, 1943, the ghetto was again surrounded by SS andUkrainians. The Germans loaded those who did not have to go towork on trucks and drove them to the cemetery to be shot. Therest were sent to concentration camps. Thus, the ghetto inCzenstochova was eliminated. No trace of Jewish life was left inthe city.In the camps, life for the Jews was hell. They were overworked;there was lack of food and the accommodations were insanitary. Theghetto survivors now were not only starving, they suffered fromfleas and lice. Their lot was shared by Jews from Plashov, Skarziskand other cities. Even a day before the liberation of Czenstochovaby the Red Army on January 17, 1945, the Germans managed toround up another few thousand Jews and to send them to Buchen-wald, Gross-Rosen and Ravensbruck, where most of them weremurdered. Of the 5,200 Jews still found in Czenstochova onLiberation Day, only 1,500 were natives of the city.Prominent People of CzenstochovaChaim WekslerSzmuel GoldsteinJakob Rosenberg30CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyFrom Integration to DestructionThe jews of czenstochova were active in association with thelocal gentile society in all fields. The role they played in industry,business and culture had significant influence on the whole city.At the same time, the Jewish community developed purely Jewishculture, religious studies and social events. It also established afund to assist the needy. All this gathered prestige for the cityin the eyes of all Jews in Poland.There were two big synagogues, the old one located on Nadzecz-na corner Mirowska, and the new one, located on Wilsona at thecorner of Garibaldiego. In addition, Jews worshipped in chevrosand the Chasidim prayed and studied nights and days inshtiblech. On December 25, 1939, the new synagogue on Wilsonawas burnt down by the Germans.Elementary schools and private cheders were available to theJewish children of the city where they studied religious andsecular subjects. Higher education was offered by the JewishGimnazium and Akser School, I. L. Peretz High School and a pro-fessional school.All political parties were active in Czenstochova: the Bund, theModerate Zionists, the Revisionists and even the CommunistParty (which was illegal in Poland at the time).During the years 1940—41, thousands of Jews from the neighbour-ing villages settled in Czenstochova to find refuge and shelterwithin a larger community. When the big ghetto was establishedin April 1941, thousands of Jews were concentrated in this smallai*ea. They suffered hunger and disease. Fear and terror seizedthe whole community when on Yom Kippur, September 22, 1942,woi'd spread that the ghetto was surrounded by the SS and theircollaborators, the Ukrainians and the Polish police. The next day,the big ‘ Actia” began. Nearly all Jews were transported to Treb-linka. About 39,000 Jews were carried off to this death camp.Hundrads more were murdered by the Nazis and their helpers inthe city. These were buried in a hugh common grave on KawiaStreet. After the “Actia”, the remaining 5,000—6,000 Jews werepacked into a small ghetto. A few of them were allowed to stayat their work places.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy29T‘7yDPipTNn p»njyn TNUpyn>7HENRYK MARKUSFELDProminent PhilanthropistHenry Markusfeld was born in 1852.

The founding members were:J. Sz. Koblenz, Sz. Goldstein, Blechstein, Finkelstein,A. M. Epstein, Ch. Weksler and I. Engel. A great effort was madeto sign up new members for the organization. This was not aneasy assignment. The Chasidic element started a verbal waragainst the Mizrachi in which all the Chasidic rabbisparticipated. They campaigned against the Zionist and theMizrachi movement until the First World War began. The anti-Zionist agitation weakened at the time of the Balfour Declaration.Many of the Chasidim then joined the Mizrachi movement.Immediately after World War I, Jews began to emigrate fromPoland to North and South America. More than half a million Jewsleft Poland seeking refuge from anti-Semitism. As the doors ofimmigration to the American continents began to narrow, somebegan to look toward Eretz-Israel as a haven. The PalestinianOffice busily issued visas to Palestine. A great celebration tookplace in Czenstochova in October 1934 when, among the 1100Jewish people leaving Poland for Palestine, 137 hailed fromCzenstochova. The Zionist movement began to organize protestmeetings against the British Government when it restrictedimmigration to Palestine (the State of Israel was only born in1948). Czenstochova Jewry, along with Jews in other importantcities of Poland participated in these protest meetings.The first Aleja, a prominent street in Czenstochovawhere the young people used to walk.26CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacyture, burning everything inside — benches, prayer books, scrollsand all other religious paraphernalia. The Synagogue was razedto the ground.The Trade SchoolThe Czenstochover Trade School was established in 1898. It wasfounded by Henry Markusfeld as a monument in memory of hisparents, Adolph and Emestina Markusfeld. The imp)ortance of theTrade School could only be evaluated if we remember the littleregard held for the Jewish tradesman or labourer at that time. Atradesman was synonymous with illiteracy. On the trade schoolcommittee in 1913 were Henry and Joseph Markusfeld, E. Ratner,S. Hertz, Frankel, Dr. Batavia and director Asorodobzie.Foremost among the many great institutions of Czenstochovawere the “Dobroczynnoszcz”, the Jewish Hospital, a home for theelderly called Moshev Zakeinim as well as Hachnasat Orchim, ahome for the poor and an institution to feed the needy, BethLehem. On the executive of Beth Lehem was S. Niemirowski,B. Botshan, M. Epstein and others.Another very imp)ortant institution was the Czenstochova branchof “TOZ”. Its central office was in Warsaw. The director of thisuseful organization of health services was Dr. Stefan Kon-Kolin.“TOZ”, founded in 1923, included the following departments: theSchool of Hygiene under the supervision of Dr. Leon Gutman, theTuberculosis and Physiotherapy department were under the direc-tion of Dr. Julian Lipinski, and Dentistry under Dr. Peretz. Thesecretary, Jacob Rosiner, was a talented organizer. “TOZ” serveda large part of the Jewish community of Poland.The Zionist MovementIn the first year of an independent Poland, between 1919 and theoutbreak of World War II, the Zionist Movement was very activein Czenstochova. The founding of a Jewish National body couldbe described as a very important event. Its leaders, I. Grinbaumand H. Hartclass, were elected to the Polish parliament. Theirduty was to defend the Jewish minority. The Zionist Movementhad branches in all provinces.Another important body, founded in 1922 by Dr. Chaim Weitzmanand other Zionist personalities, was the “Keren Hayesod”, a fundto purchase land in Israel.The presence of the Zionist movement was very visible in Czen-stochova. Membership extended from the extreme right wing, the“Mizrachi”, to “General Zionists” and to the leftist “Poale Zion”.A great majority of the younger generation of Jews in Czensto-CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy25Personalities and Institutionsof the Jewish CommunityCzenstochova can be described as an ideal Jewish community.Many of its members were always ready to help others. HenryMarkusfeld, President of the elected Jewish Council (Kehillah)was equally well liked by Jews and Gentiles. He was generous withhis time and his money. His successor, as the Council’s President,was Samuel Goldstein. Together with people such as ChaimWeksler, Dr. Zaks, S. Dziriat, H. Maitlis, Mendel Epstein andDr. H. Gaisler, he made important contributions to the Jewishcommunity.The spiritual leader of Czenstochova in the 1920s and ’30s wasthe renowned Talmudist and scholar Rabbi Nachum Ash. Othergreat Talmudic scholars were Rabbi Josele Kirer (Josele Prokosh),Rabbi Nachum Grinfeld, Rabbi Josele Klajnplatz and Rabbi B.Rubin.During a gathering of religious leaders of Czenstochova in 1855,the Jewish community found that it needed a larger Shul. Aresolution to build one was adopted immediately. This Shulbecame known as the Community Shul and it existed until theNazis had it destroyed. The Jews built another Shul at the begin-ning of the Twentieth Century, known as the Deitshe Shul. It wasa beautiful structure of which the Jewish Community was veryproud. The Germans set it afire and destroyed it in 1939.The Destruction of the New SynagogueIt was Christmas Eve, scarcely 4 months after the Germansoccupied Czenstochova. With the help of the crime-relatedelement of the Pohsh population they committed one of their mostdisgraceful acts. They set the new Synagogue on fire, razing itto the ground.On Garibaldiego Street (formerly Spadek) one could hear the wildshouts of Polish youths mixed with German slogans. Stones werethrown into the windows of Jewish homes. A few minutes later,one could see Polish and German hooligans throwing fire bombsinto the Synagogue. The fire rapidly spread through the struc-24CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leff&cyDuring times of pilgrimage, one could see large numbers of {peoplefrom the neighbouring villages walking along the alleys. Theycame from the direction of the Jasna Gora Convent and headedfor the market to sell their products. Later, they bought clothingand household items from their earnings.The City DistrictsThe very poor part of the city was called the Nadrzeczna Street.At the end of the winter, when the ice began to melt, the riverVarta would often overflow its banks on to Nadrzeczna Streetthreatening to flood the houses in this low section of the city.Better situated was Garncarska Street (known as Ibper Street).There were stores selling bread, bagels and smoked herring nextto a small tavern where one could meet all kinds of strange charac-ters. Senatorska Street was different again. Here were thequarters of young Chasidic families and business people. OnSaturdays, these families would walk out wearing their traditionalJewish garb. A man in a white coat and high turban usually stoodnear the church on Butscher Street (Yatke Street) sellinglemonade. Each Tuesday, textiles, clothing, shoes, paints, fur-niture, pottery, fruits and groceries were sold in the New MarketSquare (Novy Rinek).

In the cultural and social spheresCzenstochova did not lag behind the other kehilloth in Poland. Thescope of its cultural and social activities was broader than manysimilar communities in quantity and quality. In the politicalsphere, all the Jewish parties were present on the Jewish scene,from extreme right to radical left.Until the 1930s the kehillah administration was in the hands ofthe Mizrachi. When the government issued its new election lawof October 24, 1930, the proportion of the various political groupsin the kehillah administration was revamped so that the Agudah,together with some non-religious groupings, became the majori-ty in the kehillah council and its administration.In the economic field, the Jews of Czenstochova were instrumen-tal in developing medium and small industries, especially in ironand metal products, which helped push the German products outof the Polish market.The anti-Jewish policy of the government in the political andeconomic fields, the heavy taxation and the economic restrictionshit the Jews of Czenstochova just as it did the other kehilloth inthe country. The boycott which Polish anti-Semitic parties placedagainst Jewish trade was to some extent more effective inCzenstochova than in other cities. This was so because the Chris-tian population in Czenstochova was strongly under the influenceof the local Catholic clergy. Thus, for instance, there was a per-manent boycott against those Jewish businesses which producedChristian religious objects.There were two more pogroms in Czenstochova, the first in 1919,the second in 1937, with loss of both life and property. From thetime of the second pogrom until the Spring of 1939, the Jews ofCzenstochova lived in a sharpened anti-Semitic atmosphere. Atthe same time, they organized an energetic campaign to helpthose Jews who had been deported from Germany at the end of1938. World War II and the Nazi-German destruction of PolishJewry put an end to the kehillah of Czenstochova.The Streets of CzenstochovaOne of the most noted streets in Czenstochova was the “Aleja Pro-menade”. It could be compared to the most beautiful boulevardsof other large European cities. Tall trees lined both sides of thealley. The boulevard was divided into three different sections. Thefirst of them was mainly inhabited by Jewish residents and storeowners. Attractive residential and commercial buildings flankedboth sides of the promenade. In the second Aleja was a mixtureof Jewish and gentile residences and stores. In the third alley livedmostly gentiles.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy21After the Polish rebellion against Russia of 1863, Czenstochovabecame a new industrial and commercial center, and in this pro-cess the Jews of the city participated actively. In 1897, there were11,764 Jews in Czenstochova out of a general population of43,863.In the continuing development of industry and commerce at theend of the 19th century, Jews played the chief role. In the makingof toys and other celluloid products, the Jews of Czenstochovawere pioneers.The increased participation of Jews in Czenstochova’s economiclife brought with it a growing anti-Semitism which pervadedalmost all segments of the Polish Christian population. Theseanti-Semitic sentiments found a mass outlet in the pogrom of1902.Professional Working UnionsAccording to the census of 1897, of the approximately 12,000 Jewsof Czenstochova, 2,155 people were employed in the industry andhandicraft, 800 people worked as tailors and the remainder of theworking class were employed in small shops and factories.Community LifeJewish communal life was intensely active at the turn of the 20thcentury. A number of communal institutions were founded at thattime, such as a charity organization (“Dobroczynnoszcz”), aJewish hospital, a travelers’ hostel, a trade school, a TalmudTorah, the cultural society, LIRA, a farm for agricultural train-ing for Jews, and a number of clubs, societies, loan societies andan old age home.All these institutions, however, were outside the kehillah adminis-tration, which was then in the hands of assimilationists, the“property” of several Jewish families. A need was felt at that timeto centralize Jewish communal life, to unify the diffused socialenergies, and to democratize the kehillah. The campaign toachieve these aims began in 1912 but succeeded only partially.The leading lights of the kehillah administration still remainedthe assimilationists because they were the propertied class in thecity and provided the main support of the kehillah budget.In 1914, when World War I broke out, Czenstochova came underGerman occupation. Another painful period began for the Jewsin the city. Community life ceased and Jews experienced all thehorrors of suffering brought by the war.Between the Two World WarsIn the p)eriod between the two World Wars, in independent Poland,the Jewish community in Czenstochova, like all of Polish Jewry,20CZENSTCM:;H0V - Our Lee&cyJewish Settlement in CxenstochovaThe exact date of Jewish settlement in Czenstochova has not beenhistorically established. In light of unconfirmed reports, it is prob-able that a Jewish community already existed there in the secondhalf of the 18th century At that time Jews from Czenstochovawere buried in the cemetery at nearby Yanowa (Yuniv). It was notuntil the time of the Prussian occupation at the beginning of the19th century that we find concrete data regarding a Jewish com-munity in Czenstochova. In 1808, there were 495 Jews in Czen-stochova out of a general population of 3,349.Precisely what kind of “Kehillah” organization existed during thePrussian period is not known, but there is no doubt whatever thatthere was some form of organized community life, necessitatedby the Prussian fiscal policy toward Jews. The first activities ofthe kehillah administration during the Warsaw Duchy era werethe establishment of a synagogue and the selection of a Rav(rabbi).At a meeting of the Kehillah administration, held on Av 8, 5568(1808), a certain Yaakov ben Eliezer Levi was elected represen-tative and head of the kehillah. He was also the treasurer. Thekehillah had three parnassim, each month another parnass tookover the office. The parnassim had jurisdiction over the financesof the kehillah and controlled its expenditures.There was also a Bet-Din whose head enjoyed certain privilegeswhich were enumerated in a document signed by forty leadingJews of the city. The number of signatures indicates that Czensto-chova was then already an important community. Also, the factthat the Jewish settlements around Czenstochova were connectedadministratively with its kehillah administration indicates thegrowth and importance of the Czenstochova Jewish community.With the growth of the Jewish population in the city (and the cor-responding increase in the number of the needy), a number ofrelief organizations came into being. Czenstochova soon becameknown as a wealthy community. In 1846-47, with a famine in thecountry, the kehillah administration organized help for the needyand unemployed Jews. In 1858-60, the kehillah opened schoolsfor Jewish children, along with the chedarim already in existence.In 1862, when the Jewish districts were abolished, many of theJews from the surrounding cities and towns began to stream intoCzenstochova and to build new industries and commercial under-takings. In this way, they contributed to the economic growth ofthe city. At the same time, many Jews with capital left Czensto-chova to settle in Warsaw and Lodz, where they eventually oc-cupied prominent places in the economic life of these communi-ties. In Czenstochova itself a migration began from the olderquarters of the city to the newer.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Leeacy 19CITY PLAN OF CZENSTOCHOVACZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy1770 monks. The Swedes were unable to conquer the fortress andwere forced to withdraw. A miracle was declared. Czenstochovawas then pronounced a religious holy shrine. However, in 1793,the Austrians did conquer Czenstochova.The growth of Czenstochova paralleled the importance of themonastery. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Czenstochova wasgiven certain privileges by the Polish kings and the Sejm. Anumber of convocations and meetings of kings, nobles, andleading personages were held there. Czenstochova became acenter of political events in the Europe of that period.In 1793, Czenstochova was annexed by Prussia. It was not until1806 that the Polish Army of the Duchy of Warsaw reconqueredthe city from the Prussians. After the Congress of Vienna (1815),Czenstochova remained within the borders of the Polish kingdom.The industrialization of the city paralleled its growth and develop-ment. In 1877 there were in Czenstochova factories for makingpaper, wallpaper, soap, candles, chicory, lime bricks and manyother products. The end of the 19th century saw the rise of ironfoundries, textile mills and the steel industry. Trade grew at thesame time and Czenstochova began to play a role in the economiclife of the country. In 1897, the city numbered about 45,000people.Several Polish parties were influential in Czenstochova. TheChristian population, which was under the influence of Catholicclericalism and the anti-Semitic National Democratic Party, wasconservative and Anti-Semitic. The progressive and liberal seg-ment of the Christian population was small in number.During the First World War (1914-1918), Czenstochova itself wasunder German occupation, while the monastery was underAustrian rule. In 1918, in reborn Poland, Czenstochova belongedto the province of Kielce. By 1921, the population of the city hadgrown to 81,000; by 1939 to about 130,000.The city contained a number of libraries, schools, government andprivate high schools, and a number of cultural organizations. Inthe general and economic life of the country, Czenstochovaoccupied a prominent place. In the industrialization of the coun-try between the two World Wars, Czenstochova also played animportant part. A number of new factories were built (many byJews) which were the only ones of their kind then in Poland. Thecity also was important commercially.World War II halted the growth of the city. The Nazi-Germanoccupation hampered and disrupted its activity. After the war,Czenstochova returned to play a leading role in Poland’s economiclife.16C7:y.NSTC)CHOV - Our Lee&oyThe City of CzenstochovaThe city of czenstochova had its origins in a village calledCzenstochowka. At the beginning of the 14th century amonastery (Yasna Gura -Bright Mountain) was erected near thevillage. Thanks to this monastery, the village of Czenstochowkagradually developed into a cityUp to the 17th century, the development of the monastery con-tained nothing of particular historical significance. In general thegrowth of the city was slow. It was not until the middle of the17th century, with events such as the uprising of the Cossacksunder Chmielnitzki and later the Swedish wars, that the city andthe monastery became noteworthy. The city was transformed in-to a fortress which encompassed the monastery—church as well.There were times when the city was considered to be the mostimportant religious ground in all of Poland. During the time ofan independent Poland, Czenstochova was a national symbol,especially so in moments of combat for national survival.Geographically, Czenstochova was the gateway to the heart andto the capital of Poland, Warsaw. During wars invaders wouldattempt to capture its fortress. When such battles ended with thevictory of the Polish army, this victory was attributed to the in-tervention of the “Black Madonna”, a venerated image located inthe Church of the “Jasna Gora” Convent in Czenstochova.During peacetime the supernatural powers of the Black Madonnaattracted pilgrims from near and far who sought her help. In the17th century, one pilgrim wrote twelve songs of prayer for the pro-tection of the Black Madonna of Jasna Gora, who often hides thevictims of evil. “Czenstochova” means, in fact, “hide often”.On August 19, 1382, the King of Poland bequeathed extraordinaryrights to the monastery. This increased the influence of thechurch and added to the growth of religious power, not only of thepeople of Poland, but of the whole Catholic world.In 1655 a Swedish Army of 14,000 soldiers and 19 pieces of heavyartillery, enormous in those days, attempted to capture the for-tress of Czenstochova. It was protected by a mere 160 soldiers andCZENSTOCHQV - Our Legacy15The remaining Jews were transferred to two slave labor campsorganized by the city’s HASAG factories. On July 20, 1943, about500 prisoners from these camps were executed at the Jewishcemetery In 1944, the HASAG labor camps were enlarged, whena few thousand Jewish prisoners from Plaszow concentrationcamp, Lodz ghetto, and the slave labor camp of Skarzysko-Kamienna were moved there. Before leaving the city, onJanuary 17, 1945, the Germans managed to deport almost 6,000prisoners from the HASAG camps to the concentration camps ofBuchenwald, Gross-Rosen and Ravensbrueck in Germany. The5,200 prisoners who succeeded in hiding were saved by the SovietArmy. The Jewish survivors tried to rebuild their community. InJune 1946, 2,167 Jews lived in Czenstochova. Some Kibbutzim,to prepare Jewish youth for settlement in Palestine, were activeuntil 1948. A Jewish school existed till March 1946, and a JewishReligious Society was active. After 1948, Jews left Czenstochovaand settled mainly in Israel in 1949 and 1957. After 1968, almostall those had who remained left Poland. Organizations ofCzenstochova Jews are active in Israel, the United States, Canada,Argentina and France.“Jasna Gora" Convent in Czenstochova.14CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegateA Brief HistoryFrom the files of Beth Hatefutsoth in 'Tel AvivCzENSTOCHOVA IS LOCATED approximately 125 miles south-west ofWarsaw; the shrine of the Jasna Grora Madonna in Czenstochovawas celebrated as a center of Catholic pilgrimage. Seventy-fiveJewish residents were recorded in Czenstchova in 1765 and 495in 1808, when an organized community was established.Although Jewish residence was prohibited in certain districts, theJewish population in Czenstchova grew from 1,141 in 1827 (18.5%of the total) to 2,976 in 1858 (34.5%), and in 1863, with the aboli-tion of the Jewish quarter, to 3,360 (37.3%). By 1900, it numbered11,764 out of a total population of 39,863 (29.5%), in 1921, 22,663and in 1939, 28,486. From the early 19th century, Jews playedan important role in the development of industry and commercein Czenstchova, and a number of Jewish social, educational andcharitable institutions were established.The German Army entered the city on September 3, 1939. Thenext day, later called “Bloody Monday”, a pogrom was organizedin which a few hundred Jews were murdered. On September 16,a “Judenrat” was established, chaired by Leon Kopinski. OnDecember 25, a second pogrom took place and the greats3magogue was set on fire. In August 1940, about 1,000 youngmen, between the ages of 18—25, were sent to the forced laborcamp in Cieszanow (Lublin Province), where almost none sur-vived. When a greater number of Jews from other parts of westernPoland came to Czenstchova in 1940—41, the city’s Jewish popu-lation grew by several thousands. On April 9th, 1941, a ghetto wasestablished. When it was sealed off (August 23) the populationsuffered severe overcrowding, hunger and epidemics. OnSeptember 23, 1942 (the day after Yom Kippur), a large-scale“aktion” began. By October 5, about 39,000 people had beendeported to Treblinka and exterminated, while about 2,000 wereexecuted on the spot. The ghetto, by now largely diminished andwithin new borders (now called the “Small Ghetto”) had about6,500 people, of whom about 1,000 were “illegal”.I PrewarCzenstochovaauditsJewishConununityThe Conservative Synagogue“Di Deitche Shul"12CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyZundel was in fact prosecuted (in Ontario) under the CriminalCode for engaging in these scurrilous publications in which theSupreme Court of Canada rendered its judgment in August 1992.The Court, in a 4—3 majority decision acquitted Zundel and de-dared Section 181 of the Criminal Code (i.e. willfully spreadingfalse news which is likely to cause injury to a public interest) un-constitutional as infringing upon the right of freedom of expres-sion, under Section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights andFreedoms.It is trite to say that the Zundel judgment did not condone thepublications in question and the central issue was the constitu-tional one of freedom of speech and expression. Both the majorityand dissenting judges commented that the Holocaust denial writ-ings of Zundel were offensive. In particular, the following passageof the dissenting judges keenly reflects the Court’s empathy tothe Jewish experience:“Holocaust denial has pernicious effects upon Canadians whosuffered, fought and died as a result of the Nazis’ campaign ofracial bigotry and upon Canadian society as a whole. For Holo-caust survivors, it is a deep and grievous denial of the significanceof the harm done to them and thus belittles their enormous painand loss. It deprives others of the opportunities to learn from thelessons of history. To deliberately lie about the indescribable suf-fering and death inflicted upon the Jews by Hitler is the foulestof falsehoods and the essence of cruelty. Throughout their tragichistory, the circulation of malicious false reports about the Jewishpeople has resulted in attacks, killing, pogroms and expulsions.They have indeed suffered cruelly from the publications of false-hoods concerning their culture.’’It is my considered opinion that the Criminal Code section underwhich James Keegstra was convicted (in Alberta, Section 319(2)— the dissemination of hate propaganda) which was upheld by theSupreme Court of Canada in 1990 should be applied extensivelyby the Canadian justice system against the likes of Zundel toprohibit Holocaust denial publications.Holocaust survivors and their descendants are undoubtedlyentitled to the protection of law in preventing the disseminationof hate and Holocaust denial propaganda. If ignored, it may resultin further attacks on Jews. The time has come at last for Jewsto live without fear of violence and persecution.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy11The Slander of Holocaust DenialBy Howard TatnerWords alone cannot describe the fear, pain and profound losssuffered by millions of innocent Jews during the Holocaust. Thishuman tragedy was inflicted upon European Jews by a cold andcalculated plan conjured up by treacherous bullies and thugsfMDsing as politicians and military officers calling themselvesNazis of Germany’s Third Reich.This “Final Solution’’ was tragically executed with carefulplanning and precision by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime whichresulted in the cold-blooded murder of six million Jewish men,women, and children. The survivors courageously went on to buildnew lives from a past of destruction and horror. The persecutionand specific targeting of Jews was of course nothing new to theJewish experience. However, for these atrocities to have occurredin the 20th century, in a seemingly civilized Europe, is horrifying.As the number of heroic survivors dwindle along with theirpersonal testimonies of the brutal atrocities, it is crucial that theNazi path of murder and destruction be well documented. Manylibraries and documentation centres such as Yad Vashem, Israel’smemorial to the victims of the Holocaust, provide invaluablehistorical resources which pay tribute to the beloved victims.My father-in-law, Harry Klein, has now proudly contributedanother book to the archives of Holocaust rememberance. Thisbook is essentially a compendium of personal stories and reflec-tions of those Holocaust survivors of Czenstochova and theirdescendents.The recent surge of Holocaust denial, international in scope, isnothing less than a vicious lie and slanderous attack perpetratedby a new breed of anti-Semites and neo-Nazis. Although the likesof Canada’s three infamous Holocaust deniers, Ernst Zundel,James Keegstra and Malcolm Ross appear to constitute a mi-nority in their racist beliefs and convictions, it is imperative thattheir publications be declared illegal and removed fromcirculation.CZENSTOCHOV ~ Our Legacy9In Appreciation ofHarry KleinRecounting the destruction of the Czenstochover Jewish Commu-nity is not an easy task. The Czenstochover Holocaust Survivorsare expressing their gratitude to Harry Klein, President of theCzenstochover Society of Montreal. It is due to his vision, inspira-tion, strong commitment and continued effort that this book hascome to fruition.Mr. Klein took it upon himself to organize and research this book.He has strived tirelessly through an extensive network of Czen-stochover Holocaust Survivors in Miami, Chicago, New York,Ibronto and Montreal to obtain numerous personal testimonialsand memoirs as either research materials or as submissions forthis book. In addition, Mr. Klein has done much to raise fundsto finance the publication of the book, “Czenstochov - OurLegacy”.We appreciate his strong commitment to bring to life the tragicdestruction of the vibrant Czenstochover Jewish Communitywhich existed for over 300 years.We wish Mr. Klein a heart-felt Thank You from the first andsecond generations and all the children and grandchildren forgenerations to come who will read this book so that we may neverforget to keep our vigil and ensure that a Jewish Holocaust willnever happen again!Central Book Committee8CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyI have many times, in my writings about the Holocaust, expressedmy opinion that we, the generation that survived the Holocaust,are not strong enough, for we had to begin the slow and painfulprocess of mending our shattered lives. The future generationswill demand a settling of account with the German murderers fortheir unforgivable crimes.Our great and vibrant Jewish Community of Czenstochov had apopulation of about 29,000 during the time of the German occupa-tion. If one includes the Jews of the neighboring areas, such asKlobuck and Krzepitz and others, Czenstochov had a Jewishpopulation of 48,000 people. The Community (Kehilah) existed forover 300 years, and its Jews did not harm anyone. What right didthe German murderers have to come and exterminate us brutal-ly? Who gave them the right to gas our wives and children, youngand old? Who? Who? I feel very strongly that the account of theJewish Nation and its German murderers remains open for a longtime, and a dramatic conclusion will, one day, arrive.When our children and grandchildren will hear the choking cryof the Survivor, such a loud cry, carried through the distance ofcenturies, will continue.Td you, my dear friend, Harry Klein, I would like to express mydeepest thanks for the sacred work you have presently under-taken. To involve the second and third generations, to familiarizethem with the great treasures of our rich Jewish past and thetragic destruction of the Holocaust, will help them to be proudthat they belong to the Jewish nation.Harry Klein on his research mission at a Czenstochover LuncheonMeeting in Miami Beach, Florida, 1989.CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy7About This Bookand its PublisherBy Zvi RosenweinPublished in Yiddish in the *'Algenieiner JournaP, May 31, 1991Recently, my good friend, who is originally from my hometownCzenstochov, sent me a letter and bulletin infonhing me of a bookto be published. This good friend is Harry Klein(er). Although hehas lived in Montreal, Canada, for many more years than inCzenstochov, Czenstochov remains deeply rooted and engravedin his heart.I knew his parents very well. Theirs was a prominent Chasidicfamily in Czenstochov. I had studied with Harry’s older brother,Yankel, who was considered a great scholar and genius. HarryKlein has devoted much of his time and thoughts to the Holocaustand the destruction of his hometown Czenstochov. He raised abeautiful family of children and grandchildren. Fbr many years,he has thought about how to instill the memory of his parents,brothers and of the great and vibrant Jewish community of Czen-stochov in the heart of his children and grandchildren. He, thus,decided to publish a book in English, devoted to the Jewish com-munity of Czenstochov, which had existed for over 300 years.A great number of Holocaust survivors of the first and secondgenerations are participating in this book. We know that manybooks have been published by the second generation of theHolocaust survivors. These books have consisted predominantlyof psychoanalytical studies of the behavior of survivor parentsand their children and the negative impact it has had on the livesof the younger generation. The books are often an insult to theparent who survived the Holocaust.We read very often the statements made by German historiansand also by the present German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, thatit is about time we finished with the past, that the Germansshould stop carrying the guilt. According to the Germans, othernations have done far worse than they.

Bomba introduced the publisher, Mr. Harry Klein, whodeclared: “I took upon myself, on the request of the SecondGeneration, that great and important responsibility, and I amdevoting my time and energy to researching and gatheringmaterials, concerning the publication of the Czenstochover Bookto be written in English.” He appealed to all of us to help him inthis great endeavor.Mr. Klein continued to say, “We are the last survivors of theHolocaust, and everyone must participate to be a part of thisBook. Our testimony will be the only challenge to the lies andattempts to deny the Holocaust. It will also serve as a tool toeducate future generations about that event.”After many discussions, the importance of publishing a book inthe English language was accepted by all present with greatenthusiasm.On the suggestion of Mr. Harry Klein, Mr. A. Bomba asked themeeting to form a Central Book Committee and the followingLandsleit were suggested:CZENSTOCHOV - Our Legacy3INTRODUCTION‘We have accomplished a triumphant victory.7b collect memoirs and tears, fragments of fireand sorrow, tales of despair and defiance andnames. . (Elie Wiesel).The Jewish community of Czenstochova had existed over 300years when it fell victim to Hitler’s outrageous “final solution”.This book tells how this flourishing community ceased to exist.On May 5, 1945, at the gate of “liberation” at the Allach-Dachauconcentration camp, I made a pledge that I would document thehorrors I witnessed during those years. Forty-eight years later,I have finally fulfilled this pledge. It was a monumental task. Ihumbly dedicate this book to the survivors and our futuregenerations.The surviving members of the Czenstochova Jewish Communitiesin Canada and the United States, as well as their families in thesecountries have helped me to put this volume together. They havecontributed financially and have recorded their personalmemories, bitter as they were. They have expressed their feelingsand have made their own pledge.Our children and those coming after them must never forget thatsix million Jews perished during the Holocaust. They must beinvolved in keeping the memory of their brutally persecuted andmurdered ancestors alive. They must work against racism anddiscrimination and uphold tolerance and human rights.There are fewer survivors left with each passing year — fewer menand women who were there. I know that this book is of great valueto the survivors. It is they who have had to live with their privatenightmares and face an often hostile world. It is they who havehad to make a new start in strange countries and make a successof their shattered lives. It is they who have laid the foundationsfor their children to build on. It is they who can be proud of theirachievements.Many books have been written on the Holocaust. Many films anddocumentaries have been made. This volume is the story of theJewish community of Czenstochova, a historic city in Ftoland,which was my home.September 1992Harry KleinThis is our legacyIt is not a record of thosewho perished in theHolocaust. It is the story ofthose who survived andrebuilt their shattered hves.It is a legacy for ourfamilies and a document ofour existence for the world.We would like it to be a toolfor the historians of thefuture. This book will bedistributed to all HolocaustMuseums and majorlibraries throughout NorthAmerica.Our story must not diewith us, but live on forever!xxivCZENSTOCHOV ~ Our Legacypropagate a spirit of tolerance. During the ceremony marking the45th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, Lech Walesa,the charismatic leader of “Solidarity”, admitted that anti-Semitism existed in Poland and appealed to all Poles toacknowledge the history of Polish Jews and their intellectualcontribution to Polish life. “As a son of this land”, Walesa said,“I implore you today to remember the common stormy history ofour two nations. I am also begging your forgiveness for everythingthat has poisoned that history, including painful anti-Semiticoutrages.” These words can be seen as an official attempt at recon-ciliation. One can only hope that they will have closed the mosttragic chapter in the history of the Polish Jews.CZENSTOCHOV — Our Legacyxxiuin the country’s principal cities — Warsaw, Lodz and Szczecin.They were artisans, tradesmen and professional people. Oncemore, they founded Jewish schools and theatres, publishedYiddish newspapers and organized political parties. The JewishSocial and Cultural Society was established in 1954, followedthree years later by the Jewish Historical Institute. However, thefuture held no great promise for all these activities. Soon the pro-gressing Stalinization of Poland brought Jewish institutions toa standstill.During the 1956 “thaw” an abortive attempt was made by theStalinist faction within the Communist party to whip up anti-Semitic sentiments in Poland in order to gain short-term politicalbenefits. Despite its failure, another wave of Jewish emigrants leftthe country. Only about 30,000 Jews, primarily members of theintelligentsia, were left behind.The 1967 Israeli victory furnished a pretext for further discrimi-nation. The Soviet Union had backed the Arabs, regarding Israelas an aggressive Zionist state. It dismissed Zionism as a racistideology. The entire Communist camp was now infected by ananti-Zionist and anti-Semitic campaign.The Communist-dominated Polish media spread the new viciousanti-Semitism. This tendency began to permeate the generalatmosphere of the whole country. The Jews, naturally rejoicing inthe Israel’s victory, were now labelled “Zionist Fifth Columnists”.The anti-Jewish bias which had until then been kept under controlby a segment of Pblish society, now came into the open andgenerated feelings of alienation. Even those Jews who hadnothing in common with Communism felt endangered. A. new ex-odus of a further 25,000 people took place much to the shame ofthe Communist state.Ultimately, the party’s anti-Semitic faction failed. The 6,000 Jewswho remained in Poland were mostly old people in poor healthalong with a small group of professionals. Among them was theoutstanding physician Marek Edelman, the last surviving com-mander of the Warsaw ghetto uprising. They all stayed on in thehope to live long enough to see the advent of a free Poland, ruledby a tolerant and liberal government.The year 1980 witnessed the rise of “Solidarity”, the liberaldemocratic labor movement which hastened the advance of ademocratic and pluralistic Poland. Polish Jews returned to thecountry’s public life. The genuine history of the Polish Jews, untilthen misrepresented by Communist propaganda, could once againbe exposed.In 1989, Solidarity won freedom for Poland and laid the ground-work for the construction of a democracy. An effort was made toxxiiC2a]NSTC>CHOV - Our Leeacyghetto to Treblinka. Among them was Dr. Janusz Korczak(Henryk Gk)ldszmit), a well-known physician and teacher and theauthor of children’s books. He had dechned the assistance offeredhim by his Polish friends. Instead he chose to accompany theyoung inmates of his orphanage to their deaths in the gaschambers. August 1943 witnessed the last massive deportations.Isolated, exhausted and emaciated, the Jews nevertheless triedto resist the Germans. In 1943, they put up desperate resistanceat Treblinka, Sobibor, Auschwitz and some other locations. SomeJews, who managed to slip out of the ghettos or escaped fromcamp-bound cattle trains, joined Polish resistance units. Thefamous armed uprising in the Warsaw ghetto took place in Aprilof 1943. Organized by the Jewish Combat Organization (ZOB), ledby Mordechai Anielewicz, the Warsaw ghetto revolt was the mostsignificant and tragic attempt of resistance by the Jews in Nazioccupied Europe. The fight lasted for three weeks. The entireghetto was burned and razed to the ground by the Nazis. The fewJewish survivors of the massacre were deported to Treblinka.Thus ended the 400,000 strong Jewish community of Warsaw. Itwas Poland’s largest Jewish community.Talking about the situation of the Jews in occupied Poland, onecannot fail to consider the attitude of the Polish population andthe Polish resistance movement. Jews were being murdered onPolish soil. The Nazis certainly did not need, or indeed seek, theapproval of the enslaved Polish nation for their heinous acts. Thelater suggestions that Hitler had actually counted on the approvalof Polish anti-Semites for the massacres cannot be substantiatedby any documentary evidence. The cruel reality of life under theNazis in Poland, unimaginable to Western society, placed awholesale rescue of the Jews by the Poles alone beyond the rangeof possibility.The Post-War PeriodSome 380,000 Polish Jews survived the Second World War — justabout 12% of the pre-war Jewish population.7% of them were Jewsrepatriated from the Soviet Union. !Most of the survivorsemigrated to Palestine. This reduced the Jewish population inPoland after 1947 to some 80,000. Poland had ended one thousandyears of being the world centre of Jewish culture. Centuries-oldYiddish tradition died with the murdered Polish Jews. Some at-tempts at its resuscitation are now being made in Israel and inthe United States. Sadly, they are of folkloric rather than culturalcharacter.After the war, Poland, liberated from Nazism by the Red Army,came under Communist domination. Now Jews returned toPoland and set up homes again, primarily in Lower Silesia andCZENSTOCHQV - Our LegacyxxiWorld War II and the HolocaustFollowing Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, despite all diplomaticefforts, Poland became the first target of the German imperialistdrive. The Nazi plan of expanding German living space (Leben-sraum) eastwards brought with it racial anti-Semitism. After the“Kristall Nacht” in 1938, it became obvious that in the event ofa Nazi invasion of Poland, the world’s largest Jewish communitywould be imperilled. The German attack on Poland occurred onSeptember 1, 1939. It was backed by the Soviet Union accordingto her obligation under the Ribbentrop - Molotov Pact. OnSeptember 17, the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the East.Some of the territories overrun by the Germans were subsequentlyannexed by the Reich. The rest were ruled by the so-called GeneralGovernment. Two million Polish Jews found themselves in theGerman occupied part of the country. Another one million wereunder Soviet rule. It was forbidden to travel or to change one’splace of residence. Forced labour was introduced. Every majorghetto had its appointed Jewish Council (Aeltestenrat, Judenrat)which was committed to enforce German rules and regulations.By the beginning of 1941, there were about 200 Jewish labourcamps throughout Poland. The regime of the ghettos becameincreasingly severe: an unauthorized leaving of a ghetto perimeterwas punished by death. The same penalty threatened all thoseoffering any kind of assistance to Jews. In January 1942, duringthe notorious Wannsee Conference near Berlin, the “final solu-tion’’ (Endloesung) of the Jewish question was decided. A monthearlier the first death camp at Chelmno-on-Ner in Poland hadalready been set up. Within a couple of months several thousandJews of the Lodz ghetto were gassed to death with panzer exhaustfumes. By mid-1942, the Germans had built similar camps atBelzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Brzezinka (Birkenau) which waspart of Oswiecim (Auschwitz) was also transformed into a deathfactory.Not only Polish Jews but also deportees from all over Europeperished in the gas chambers of those camps. The biggest depor-tations took place between July and September 1942 when morethan 300,000 Jews were sent in cattle trains from the WarsawXXCZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyThe cultural anti-Semitism of the inter-war years which was ac-tually shared by the overwhelming majority of European states,never took on racial trappings in Poland. Polish anti-Semites owedtheir creed to rightwing nationalist movements, present also inother European countries, whereas Polish peasants simplyadhered to centuries-old Christian anti-Judaism. However, openlyanti-Semitic Poles have not supported Nazi race theories, therebycreating the paradoxical concurrence of anti-Nazism and anti-Semitism at the extreme Polish right.During the inter-war years Poland’s Jewish political parties —Orthodox, Zionist and those affiliated with the Bund — operatedlegally and had their own representatives in parliament. Zionistorganizations were then locked in bitter struggle with Orthodoxparties for influence over the kahals. Jewish Socialists, the Bund,which often cooperated with the Polish Socialist Party, fought allthe others. Each of these groupings operated its own network ofsocieties and organizations. Some sources state that betweenthem they published more than 1700 newspapers and periodicalsin Hebrew, Yiddish and Polish.Polish Jews have left an impressive literary and artistic legacy:the paintings of Leopold Gottlieb (1883—1934), Jankel Adler(1895-1949) and Roman Kramsztyk (1885-1942); the literarywork of Bruno Schultz (1892-1942), shot in a Drohobysh streetby a drunk German trooper. Other work which has grown rightout of Yiddish culture was that of Isaak Bashevis Singer andIsrael Jeszua Singer and the ballads of Mordechai Gebirtig. Thewriters Julian Tuwim, Boleslaw Lesmian, Antoni Slonimski andJan Lechon were also of Jewish extraction, as were BrunoWinauer, Bruno Jasienski and Tadeusz Peiper.CZENSTOCHQV - Our LegacyxixMention must be made here of a number of Jews who had joinedJozef Pilsudski’s legion in the first place. Many Poles, notablysocialists, advocates of their country’s independence, reciprocatedby displaying sensitivity about Jewish issues. Prominent amongthem was none other than Jozef Pilsudski himself, the first headof the reborn Polish state after World War I.These overtures, however, failed to defuse old antagonisms andthe two nations entered the era of the Second Commonwealth(1918-1939) with a burden of mutual mistrust. The Jews feareda repetition of anti-Semitic affronts from Polish nationalists andharnessed a number of international Jewish organizations to thetask of swinging Poland’s decisions in favour of concluding atreaty on the protection of ethnic minorities. The treaty was even-tually concluded in 1919 but the practice of adherence to its pro-visions elicited objections from certain politicians of the sovereignPolish state.The Polish Republic (1918^1939)In 1918, renascent Poland was a multinational state whose ethnicminorities constituted some 33 per cent of the total population.The most numerous of them were Ukrainians, followed by Jews.The latter had been strengthened by about 800,000 of theirbrethren driven out of Soviet Russia immediately after the 1917revolution. These Jews were granted Pblish citizenship at the behestof Jozef Pilsudski, the Head of State. Poland had again becomethe largest Jewish community in the world. Upon the outbreakof World War II, there were upwards of 3 million Jews living inPoland which accounted for a third of the Jewish worldpopulation.In May 1926, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, in an effort to check thegrowing anarchy inside the Polish parliament, seized power in thewake of a military coup. The situation of the Jews thenceforwardimproved because Pilsudski regarded them as full Pblish citizensand tolerated neither the anti-Semitism of the National Demo-cratic Party nor the anti-Judaism of the Catholic Church.The new government admittedly denounced physical violence but,on the other hand, it was supportive of economic pressures.Among other things, it imposed restrictions on the ritualslaughter of cattle thereby damaging Jewish business interestsand hurting Jewish observance. It favoured emigration. TheSocialist Party of P)land opposed anti-Semitism. Despite this itbecame more and more obvious that the Jews could no longer hopeto expand the range of their economic and cultural progress. Theywere faced with increasing pauperization. The rise of anti-Semitism gradually convinced them that their presence in Polandwas undesirable.xviiiCZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyPoland under Foreign Rule (17951918)The carving up of Poland by the three neighbouring statesushered in substantial changes in the situation of the Jews. Theindividual partition zones - Russian, Austrian and Prussian —were now under different, frequently changing jurisdictionswhich diminished the privileges once bestowed on the Jews byPoland. In the Prussian- and Austrian-dominated parts of Poland,Jewish autonomy was abolished altogether. Until the outbreak ofthe ill-fated January 1863 Polish uprising, the Jews continued toregard the destroyed multinational Polish-Lithuanian Common-wealth as their motherland, and this despite their isolation fromPolish society They had fought and died in Polish national upris-ings. Many Jews had supported the 1794 insurrection led byTadeush Kosciusko who had this to say in the way of acknowledg-ment of that support: “Jews come to us and give us their lives oftheir own free will.” Warsaw Jews grabbed their swords andfought the Russians, showing that they spare no blood when itcame to fighting for human rights. A cavalry unit made up of onethousand Jewish volunteers, was set up at that time. It was ledby Colonel Berko Joselewicz, a Jew, who was later killed in action.The participation of Jews in the Polish revolts proved in no uncer-tain terms that despite the partitions and foreign domination theycontinued to identify themselves with the Polish-LithuanianKingdom. However, the days when Poles and Jews lived peacefullytogether in a multinational state were brief. Social transforma-tions taking place in foreign-dominated Poland in the late 19thcentury gradually led to an alienation of the Jews. The issue ofassimilation into Polish society was of minor significance.The new Polish bourgeoisie did not take fondly to the Jewishdomination of trade and commerce. In the past the Poles had till-ed the land while the Jews had busied themselves with trade.Their respective pursuits were complementary. By the late 19thcentury, they had become rivals. However, the crucial importancewas the emergence of nationalist movements in the lands oncebelonging to the Commonwealth - Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainianand Jewish. The manifestation of Polish nationalism affected eventhe Jewish elites who were anxious to become assimilated. Thedefinition of a Pole was narrowed down from a legal, civic con-cept to the notion of “Catholic Pole”. In this manner, the Jews weredenied the right to Polonize themselves. The Jewish victims ofpost-1881 pogroms in Polish Russia spoke no Polish and manyof them considered themselves socialist revolutionaries and na-tionalistic Zionists. Jews were now perceived as both hostile(Zionists and socialists) and alien (Orthodox Jews).All this notwithstanding, there was no shortage of manifestationsof Jewish support for the cause of Poland’s independence.CZENSTOCHOV — Our LegacyxviiDecentralization of power and the absence of uniform foreignpolicy gave the Jewish Diet an unfettered discretion to operateinternationally both in the political and religious realms. Forexample, the Diet urged the Silesian authorities to grant Jewishtraders from Poland, residence permits and licences to open prayerhouses in Wroclaw (Breslau).By the end of the 18th century the system of Jewish autonomyhad begun to crumble and disintegrate in step with the progress-ing decomposition of the political system of the gentry Common-wealth. These were the circumstances under which the Easternprovinces of Poland notably the Ukraine and Podolia, where mostof Polish Jews had found home, became engulfed by the mysticalChasidic movement. It gave a rare sense of security to the Jewishpeople, looking out for an incorrupt welfare system which thedisintegrating kahal structures could no longer deliver.The pluralistic and multi-denominational Commonwealth offeredexcellent conditions for the all-round development of Jewishculture. Up until the outbreak of the peasant revolt in the Ukrainein 1648, the Polish-Lithuanian state was the religious and in-tellectual hub of the world Jewry. The outstanding interpreter ofrabbinical literature was Rabbi Moshe Isserles (1520-1572) whoadapted the Talmudic manual Shulchan Aruch (The Laid Table)by the Sephardic Rabbi Josef Karo (1488-1572) for the benefit ofthe Ashkhenazim.Rabbi Eliahu of Vilna, who opposed the Chasidic mysticism,authored a number of learned treatises in which he endeavouredto blend Judaism with modern learning. He was also a superbtrigonometrist. His main claim to fame is the inauguration of thetradition of the Vilna yeshiva which earned that lovely city theappellation “Jerusalem of the North”.Poland was also the centre of Kabbalah and mystical movements.Szabatai Zvi (1626—1676) excommunicated by the Jewish Diet in1670, enjoyed a great following in Poland. Thousands of fanaticaldevotees, protesting against the corrupt rabbinate, supportedJakub Frank (1726—1791) of Bukowina.The Jews put great faith in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealthand its institutions, as evidenced by 16th century Jewish legends,such as the one of Abraham Prohownik who at the dawn of Polishhistory had declined the honour of being elected the King ofPoland, or of Saul Wahl who supposedly was King for just onenight. Moshe Isserles in his Response No. 73 was confident that“it is better to live on bread alone but in peace in Poland”, whilea delightful Hebrew pun suggested that “po-lin”, which wasHebrew for Poland, had actually been derived from “po lin”,meaning “here you will rest”.xviCZENSTOCHQV - Our LegacyThe Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth offered the Jews decentconditions for social and religious advancement. In the backwardeasternmost parts of the vast country - which happened to beEurope’s largest - they had a very important economic and socialrole to play. They filled in the vacuum created by sparse, destituteand gentry-dominated townspeople. The range and scope of theiroperations were much broader here than in Western Europe wherethe strong burgher classes were in a position to compete success-fully with the Jews. Given the circumstances, the massiveimmigration of European Jews to the Polish-Lithuanian landswas tantamount to their socio-religious emancipation whose enor-mity few things can remotely match in history.In the 16th century the alliance of the Jews with the monarchylost its significance in favor of a new league with the gentry. Inthe Polish Kingdom the nobility used the Jews in its struggle withthe increasingly assertive burgher class, whereas Lithuaniansand notably Ukrainian aristocrats readily exploited their coloniza-tion and civilizational talents. Jews served as administrators ofenormous landed estates in the East taking on the role of middle-men between their lordly patrons and the Ukrainian peasantry.That is why they were not spared by the 1648 peasant revolt whoseedge was aimed primarily against the nobility: the ensuingpogroms reduced for a period of time the Jewish community inthe East.It is interesting to note that their settlement in the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, their daily contacts with Christiansand their social and economic advancement did not in any wayerode the cohesion of traditional Jewish culture. Crucial for thesurvival of the latter were both the Yiddish language and the air-tight structure of the Jewish community, further cemented bypersecution in the West of Europe and by the failure of the Jews’attempted cultural integration with the societies of RenaissanceGermany, Italy and Spain. Pogroms in Western Europe had steel-ed the Jews in their belief that the Torah was their only salvationand led to the concentration of leadership in the hands ofAshkenazim. The office of the rabbi was institutionalized as thatof an unquestioned authority in the realm of Jewish law(halachah). The rabbis, in the capacity as leaders, drilled theloosely-knit communities into disciplined organizations since thesaid persecutions had eroded them structurally. The Jewish Diet(wad) looked after the interest of the Jewish population in its deal-ings with the institutions of the Polish-Lithuanian state. It wasinvolved in handling fiscal matters (which, in fact, was its numberone task) and helped find ways around all manner of welfare andcultural problems which straddled individual communities.C2ENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyXVAN HISTORICAL OVERVIEWJewish Settlement in PolandFirst Jewish settlements began to crop up in the West of thecountry in the 11th century. They grew in numbers throughoutthe 13th and 14th centuries owing to the infusion of new Jewishimmigrants fleeing the pogroms of Western Europe. Poland wasa propitious place for these unfortunates: here they would findshelter and the right conditions for their pursuits as craftsmenand traders. The Jews were, in fact, an Estate in their own rightenjoying broad economic prerogatives and constituting an impor-tant factor assisting the progress of civilization in Poland.Early Polish rulers guaranteed their Jewish subjects full religiousfreedom while opening up for them prospects for unfetteredtrading activities. Furthermore, the Jews were also left free tocarry on with their own administration of justice in matters per-taining to their co-religionists. These rights were subsequentlyextended by King Casimir the Great in 1364 and confirmed byconsecutive Polish monarchs.The Golden AgeIn the late 15th century the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,established since 1385 by the Kingdom of Poland and the GrandDuchy of Lithuania, was inhabited by 24,000 Jews. Of thatnumber, 18,000 lived in Poland and 6,000 in Lithuania. Jews livedin a total of 85 towns and accounted for 0.6 per cent of thepopulation.Persecutions sweeping across the German Empire, and thereligious wars of South-Western Europe drove masses of Jewishrefugees out of a number of countries, including Spain (1492) andPortugal (1496), and sent them heading for the Polish-Lithuanianstate which soon became the world centre of Jewish culture andcivihzation. The Golden Age of Jewish history had begun. It wenton for about four hundred years. In the mid-16th century the com-munity of this country was 150,000 strong, which number grewto 800,000 by the end of the 18th century. This figure accountedfor about three-fourths of the total of the Jewish populationworldwide.xivCZENSTOCHOV - Our LesTocyI am grateful to the Book Committee, comprised of first generationmembers Harry Klein, Lucy Nisker and Harry Rosenblum andsecond generation members Morris Szwimer, Ruth Tatner, JoyceTakefman, Evelyn Solomon, Aaron Dudkiewicz, Cypora Leb andSusan Ship.

Among those killed were a third of all EuropeanJews. These statistics are proven, but they will never be fullyunderstood.The traditional Jewish passion for justice demands the protec-tion of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty. A commit-ted Jew, Simon Wiesenthal, has devoted his life to the trackingdown of Nazi criminals in order to bring them to justice.There is so much in Jewish history that is mysterious andbewildering. Why does Judaism survive through almost fourthousand years of frequently violent confrontation with othercultures - with Greece and Rome, with Christianity and Islam ?A people is nothing without the memory of its history and itsroots.The suffering of the Jewish people in Europe is now part of worldhistory and of world literature. It was the Jewish component ina world wide landscape of disaster, brought about by Hitler.The survivors did not have the luxury of abstraction. Theirs wasan ordeal hard to comprehend, since they often were the only onesleft of large families. They mourned the loss of parents andchildren, wives and lovers, homes and possessions. They had lostthe culture in which they had grown up and their accustomed wayof life.Recounting any facet of the Holocaust is not a pleasant task.Hitler and his henchmen went on a rampage of mass murder. Yet,the world did not stop them. The world looked on. This ought tobe one of the most painful lessons we learned. It must neverhappen again!H.K.CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegacyxiPREFACEThis book is in memory of the Jewish Community ofCzenstochova which was brutally wiped off the face of the earth,the victim of Hitler’s “Final Solution’’ during the Second WorldWar.With every passing year there are fewer survivors of theHolocaust. Their unique ability to testify about the horrors of theNazi crimes disappears as they die. Their children play an increas-ingly significant role in perpetuating the memory of that terriblepast.How is this historical horror being seen through the eyes of thesecond generation ? Organizing the children of Holocaust sur-vivors in North America is a relatively recent development. In the1950s and 1960s these children were growing up. It was only inthe late 1970s that they began to recognize their common bondand their special responsibilities.The great Jewish historian Simon Dubnow pleaded with his fellowJews: “Yiddin fashreibt!’’ - Jews write!In the Warsaw Ghetto Dr. Emanuel Ringelblum appealed to thehistorians and others to write. At secret meetings of Oneg Shabashe also pleaded: “Yiddin gedenkt!’’ - Remember and Record! Laterthey hid their memoirs, their famous diaries, in canisters to beburied, so that some day they would be discovered by those whosurvived.The teachers of the Holocaust have redeemed that faith in history.It is you, young readers, who will make their efforts worthwhile.When Warsaw was destroyed, when the Vilna Ghetto was liqui-dated we were frightened. We no longer feared death. We all ex-pected to be murdered. Our fear was more profound: We wereafraid that our deaths would be forgotten; that no one will everknow that we existed. We fought not only Hitler’s plan for ourtotal and systematic destruction but also his attempt to erase thememory of the Jewish existence. Six million died. But they willnever be forgotten.CZENSTOCHOV - Our LegsusyTEdcefman, Melanie. The Holocaust, a poem 100Tatner, Lauren Klein.

Poupko, spiritual leader of the CongregationBeth Israel - Beth Aaron of Cote St-Luc, to whom I am most grateful forhis comments and moral support during my research.CommentsAs a rabbi born fifteen years after the last of the death camps wasclosed, it is with profound feelings of inadequacy that I composethese words.The histories of our now destroyed Eastern EuropeanCommunities are the poetic background of the Holocaust. Thesecommunities characterized by a majestic Jewish elegance, werethe crown jewel of the Jewish diaspora legacy. The writing of theirhistory is a sacred act. The authors of this volume have perform-ed the Mitzvah of enlarging the canon of our sacred texts. Jewishhistory is sacred because the Jewish people are sacred; and recor-ding their history is to understand that the events of Jewish lifeare Holy.What was destroyed cannot be restored. What was lost, will neverbe found, the words that can describe the end of so much and somany have not yet been spoken. What was taken from us hasirretrievably injured our collective being, and the evil that des-troyed, has irretrievably skewed our understanding of the world.The devotion to memory that this Volume demonstrates is extra-ordinary. The fact that the survivors, whose lives are documentedin this volume are so committed to preserving the memory of thepast, and so courageously rebuilt their lives, bears eloquenttestimony to the brilliance and tenacity of the Jewish spirit.Let all those who possess the stories and the secrets of the pastcome and record them. Let all those who can speak and write ofthe past, do so. Let everyone know that we are still here.Rabbi Reuben J.
