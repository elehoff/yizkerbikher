MOSHE AVITALAss. EDITORELIEZER SCHWIMMERPRINTED IN ISRAELTEL-AVIV1998BILKE MY HOMETOWNTHAT WAS - BUT IS NO MOREIntroduction - 649IntroductionBy Dr. Moshe Avital Doft-UpschitzMore than SO years passed since the Jewish communities of Bilke andVicinity Kulbasavo, Ulitkes, MISTICHEV, Rakovetz, Osy, Yilnitze,Likiveh, were eradicated. Two thousand of our dear ones, our parents,brothers, sisters and other family members died in the Holocaust by thehands of the evil forces in Europe, with great suffering and torture. Allthe Jewish Institutions, the synagogues, the houses of learning, the"Chadarim" Hebrew schools, the Yeshivah, the mikvah, hundreds of Jewishhomes, businesses, the Jewish youth clubs, and many others, have eitherbeen destroyed or taken by the non "Jewish population. Bilke and vicinityis no more Jewish it is "Judenrein". Hitler " may his name be eradicated" has accomplished his goal, the destruction of everything which was dearto us.In the Memorial Book our landsleit tell about our town, about the richand vibrant spiritual and cultural life, which was conducted for over threehundred years, during the fifteen generations that our community existed.In this book, one can find accounts of the calamity which befell our peopleduring the six years of persecution and annihilation. Our landsleit whosruvived miraculously describe the agony and suffereings they enduredduring their captivity under inhuman conditions which the Germans, theHungarians and other collaborators inflicted upon them. In it we Also findstories of heroic endurance and strong will to live so that they can leavea legacy for future generations.During the Holocaust the few of us who struggled to survive, harboredin our hearts a deep Jewish pride which we carried along wherever wewere driven by the Nazi beast. When the trumpet of freedom was finally650 - The Bilker Memorial Booksounded, the Bilker survivor was transformed into a builder of a newJewish life.The survivors can serve as a symbol to our future generations of howa remnant of the death camps, who were almost lifeless heaps of bonesturned into creative Jewish individuals. The incisive question of theprophet Ezekiel "Will these bones live again!" was given by the survivorsan unequivocally positive answer. Out of the heap of helpless victims ofthe rule of terror became the carriers of a new Jewish life.Since their liberation from the death camps, we the survivors appliedourselves to the revitalization of the dry bones. We rebuilt our lives,established new families and forged new links in the long chain of Jewishhistory.Is there a need to justify or explain whatever is done to commemorateour Jewish community of Bilke? For no greater evil can befall a peoplethan the loss of historical memory. Who can doubt that the secret of ourunique survival upon this earth is our traditional insistence onremembering all that has befallen our people in the past, for good or ill.To recall and remember has been not only an exhortation from generationto generation, but a solemn injuncton, a sacred duty occupying anancestral position in our culture, our ritual and liturgy and our religiousobservances. To dwell on the latest and most fearful and tragic chapter ofJewish martyrdom, to document what happened to our families and theentire Jewish community of Bilke, about their agony and slaughter, is notsimply an act of piety towards our familes. It is, in the deepest spiritualsense an act of self preservation which we must recall and remember andtell of our tragedies, so that we can weave it into the very fabric of ourbeing, if our descendants are to remember, if we are to survive as a people.We the Bilker landsleit are united by our heritage of suffering, by ourpast and by our determination that time not be permitted to obliterate thememory of our town and community and the years of destruction of theVevil forces. The chapter dealing with the destruction of our families andour entire Jewish community of Bilke must be told and retold until theybecome part of one being. This is also the purpose of this memorial Book.We hope that it will become part of our home and of our Jewishconsciousness.We strive by this publication to enshrine in our hearts andconsciousness and hopefully in the hearts and consciousness of the cominggeneration, the yearnings of those who died in despair, helpless andforsaken with the imperishableremebered forever till thVomOur Home Town Bilke - 653Our Home Town BilkeBy: Dr. Moshe Avital Doft-LipschitzBilke was a beautiful little town, set in a valley deep in the mountains.No fewer than six streams and rivers rushed down from the heavily foresthills. The story is told that centuries ago, a local nobleman's daughterdrowned while bathing in the big river, and the grieving father gave hername both to the river and town.The beauty of the town helped neither Jew or non Jew to escape thegeneral poverty that prevailed in the region, known by the name ofSub“Carpathian Ruthenia. Untill World War I, this area had been theeastern territory of the Austro'Hungarian empire. Upon the dissolution ofthe Austro "Hungarian empire in 1918, the region was accorded to thenewly created nation Czechoslovakia. The new govermnent ruling fromPrague was progressive.Bilke had a population of about ten thousand, two thousand of themwere Jews. It was not a homogeneous populace. Among the ten thousandresidents of Bilke and surroundings were Ukrainians, Jews, Ruthenian,Hungarians and Czechs. As a result, the people spoke a multitude oflanguages. In our home we spoke Yiddish. In Cheder or Yeshiva the rabbispoke Hebrew with Yiddish translation. In Czech school we spoke Czechand with the non Jewish populace we spoke Ruthenian, the ancient dialectof the peasants.The Jews of Bilke then numbered over two hundred families. Sincethey were blessed with ten " twelve children to a family, the total Jewishpopulation came to about two thousand. Their simple homes of brick orclay bricks were spread along or near the main road, well mixed among654 - The Bilker Memorial Booknon Jews.Even the poorest families had at least a small garden in which an arrayof flowers, vegetables, grapes and assorted fruits grew. There was a largesynagogue, which was the center of all kinds of activies and several otherplaces of worship such as the "Beit Hamidrash". Everyone in thecommunity knew everyone else from their daily contacts.No family in Bilke was considered to be poor as long as it couldmanage to set a proper Shabbat table. My mother Pearl, may G“d revengeher death, was up at three o'clock in the morning each Friday or on theeve of a holiday to bake the traditional "Challot', cakes and bread for theweek. From then on the cooking and cleaning proceeded through theafternoon. One hour before sunset the younger children brought theShabbat noon meal in a pot, called "Chulent" to the commimal oven in thegreat synagogue courtyard. When all pots were accounted for, the"Shamash" the sexton, Reb David Aaron Reisman closed up the front ofthe oven with an iron plank and sealed it with wet clay, so that the ovenwould retain the heat until the next morning.A moment before sunset everyone in the family assembled at theShabbat table to watch mother light the candles and hands covering theeyes, said the blessing that welcomed the Shabbat as "The queen of days".In our home it was traditional to light a candle for each member of thefamily. When Grandmother Rachel Yitah died, of blessed memory, mymother took over the number of candles she used to light. At that timemy mother, may she rest in peace, lit a total of twenty four candles everyFriday. This meant that the house was a splendid blaze on Friday night.After the candle lighting, all the men of Bilke gathered in the varioushouses of worship. In the great synagogue, Reb Yehoshua Doft the Cantorof the community, sang the prayers assisted by a choir of his six sons. Hewas known as a strong tenor that could break suddenly into a falsetto, andhis sons for the sweet interplay of their voices. These prayers were sentOur Home Town Bilke - 655up to heaven from a synagogue with high ceilings and very airy, with anarray of biblical scenes painted overhead. Graceful candelabras providedlight from above. For the holiday of Shavuot, the synagogue was deckedout with fresh cuttings of green branches.After the conclusion of the services, the men of Bilke hurried home.At the Shabbat table the entire family raised their voices in singing thetraditional "Zemirot” welcoming the Shabbat and the angels of peace intotheir home. Reb Yehoshua recited the "Kiddush* over the wine and afterhim all the sons did the same. Bilke and the region were famous for itswines.The braided “Challah” which had been coverd with a white "Challah*cloth so as not to be embarrassed that the wine had been blessed first, wascut and the blessing *Hamotzi* was recited. Then all dined on thetraditional foods, fish, chicken soup, noodle pudding, stewed fruits, andcakes or fruits. Eating, singing "Zemirot” and discussing scriptures werecombined into an art both subtle and regulated.On Saturday morning the men were back in the houses of worshipincluding the women who prayed in the upper section of the synagoguecalled *Ezrat Nashim* court of women. After an inspiring holy servicewhich lasted some tkee hours all went home to eat the second meal ofthe Shabbat. The younger children hurried to the communal oven whereReb David Aaron Reisman broke open the seal of the oven. With a longhandled spatula, Reb David Aaron drew out each family's pot for thenoonday meal. Even in winter snows they would be too hot to touch, andthe children carried them home with mittens. The afternoons were spentin naps, studies or visiting friends.Most of the Bilker Jews traced their roots back to Galicia or theUkraine, from which they had fled a succession of pogroms commencingwith those of Bogdan Chmelnitsky in the 17th century.Relations between Jews and non Jews were decent and correct in Bilke,656 - The Bilker Memorial Bookalthough here and there, there were anti'Semitic manifestations. Actuallythings were only nice on the surface but they could never forgive us forthe killing of their G"d. In Bilke there was no intermarriage between Jewsand non Jews, however, it was known to have happened once in the threehundred year old Jewish community of Bilke. A Jewish farm girl from anoutlying part of the town insisted on marrying the Christian boy from thefarm across the road. All the tears and threats in Bilke could not dissuadeher. With her marriage to the non Jew she was banished from the Jewishcommunity as well as from her family. The parents sat "shivah" as if theyoung daughter had died.The Jews of Bilke understood that the rise of Hitler’may his name beblotted out" would bring nothing good to them or to any of our people.Even when the Germans took the Sudetenland, put Bohemia and Moraviaunder their "protection," and made a puppet republic out of Slovakia, theythought that the wicked hand would never reach them in Bilke.As Hitler “ may his name be blotted oufdismembered theCzechoslovak Republic, he threw scraps to those nations whose help hemight need. To Hungary he offered the Carpathians, which they quicklyaccepted. This did not sit well with the local Ukranian Nationalist, who,on March 13,1939 declared an independent Ruthenian Republic. Underimmediate Hungarian attack, this republic lasted only one day. Theyquickly subdued the uprising of the local Ukranians.Bilke, in particular, was a hotbed of this movement. In the synagoguethat night, the Jews finished praying and hurried home in advance of thenine o’clock curfew that had been announced for the town. Among themwas the cobbler Reb Moshe Benyarain Klein, an officer of the "BeitHamidrash” the small synagogue and of the "Chevra Kadishah" the burialsociety.

It was said in fact that his house was situated at the edgeof Bilke so that wanderers would see it first.

Still inhis hand were the coins of charity he had collected at the synagogue.In 1940, the Hungarian government legislated decrees so called "JewishLaws" patterned after the anti’Jewish "Nurenberg Laws". Their aim wasto curtail normal activities of the Jews, requiring them to get permissionto travel from town to town, engage in trade, or practice a profession. Jewswere not allowed anymore to own properties. Many businesses were closedor transferred to non Jews. Loss of livelihood, property and civil rightsmarked the beginning of the harassment of Jews by the Hungarianauthorities.In May 1940, an order was given to mobilize all Jewish men ages 18~50able bodied into "Munko Tabor"" forced labor battalions". These units atfirst performed manual labor duties in Hungary and later after the Germaninvasion into Russia they were transported into Poland, the Ukraine andRussia to help the German war effort. These Jews built railroads, madetunnels, built airfields, trenches and other hard labor. These Jews lost theirfreedom. They had to wear yellow arm bands so that they could beidentified as Jews. They were at the mercy of the Hungarian fascist officerswho commanded these forced labor battalions. The food was bad andmeager, many were sick and suffered malnutrition. Some one hundred andfifty Bilker men were mobilized into these battalions. Most of these mendied in faraway places because of the harsh conditions which existed there,including my two brothers Chaim Leib and Nachum Uri Doft, may G“dtake revenge for their death. Many families were left without a livelihoodand struggled to meet ends. Only a handful of these recruits survived the658 - The Bilker Memorial Bookwar.The next blow came in August 1941 when an order was issued to deportall Jewish persons who could not certify their area citizenship. There weresome families that could not prove their citizenship even though they livedin Bilke or in the area for generations, because in those days people didnot keep documents and some got lost. Two dozen families of Bilke weredeported on 'Tishah B'av" of August 1941. Some fifty thousand statelessJews from the Carpathians were deported across Polish borders wherethey fell into the hands of the Germans and their Ukraine helpers. Amongthem were the families of Reb Meshulam Friedman, the scholarly teacher,Yeshaya and Mendel Kalech, the sons of Reb Leibush Kalech the "dayan'and their families. Reb Itzik Yoel Bohm and family, Moshe Elazar andhis family from Kolbasovo and others. On August 27, 28, 1941 atKamenets"Podolsk they were shot and buried in mass graves.On March 18th 1944, the Germans lured admiral Horty, the Hungariancrown price to a meeting at Schloss Klessheim and arrested him. He wastaken to the concentration camp Buchenwald where all the VIP's werekept. That night the German troops occupied Hungary. With the help ofthe fascist party "The Cross and Arrow, they formed a government whichwas anxious to get rid of the Jews. Eichman with his team arrived inBudapest and organized the deportation.Under Hungarian police escort the Jews of Bilke assembled the dayafter Pesach 1944 in the courtyartd of the great synagogue. Some 1,500Bilker Jews, children, women and the elderly were taken to the train stationand loaded into boxcars. The train stopped on the outskirts of Berehovo,beside a brick factory were the Jews of Bilke and other communities wereplaced in a ghetto. The Jews were lodged in the open sheds where bricksnormally dried. Organizing themselves quickly, they partitioned the shedsinto cubicles by hanging blankets. Each family had only enough space tolie down. With the Jews arriving by hour from the surrounding villages,as well as from Berehovo itself, the fenced in and guarded population of''L-r T'< f \ ■ \i\h- I7< \ '^ V A .*• ..' > X'.

A few weeks later, the Berehovo ghetto was emptied in a fewtransports of about 2,500 persons each. By the end of May 1944, all theCarpathian Jews were on their way to the slaughter house Auschwitz inPoland. There they died in the gas chambers. Thus came an end to ourholy and beloved community of Bilke which existed for three hundredyears.Memories of Shtetl Life: - 661Memories of Shtetl Life:Election of our Chief RabbiBy ladore ReismanIn 1929, the Autonomous Israelite Community of Bilke, a small townin the Carpathian Mountains of the former Austro’Hungarian Empire,elected its Chief Rabbi. He was Naftali Tzvi Weisz, the scion of the famedSpinker Rabbi, Eisik Weisz, who had his court and yeshiva in Munkacz.In the autumn of 1929, the young rabbi assumed his post with greatceremonial honors. A special chartered bus was to bring the rabbi and hisentourage, including his venerable father and a host of yeshiva bachurim(students).My parents and grandparents told me stories of the wonders performedby the Grand Rabbi of Spinka, one who commanded respect andadmiration from his followers. His presence alone gave those who sawhim a feeling of awe.The Spinka rabbinic dynasty had a Hassidic following numbering inthe hundreds of thousands throughout Central Europe. Many Hassidimfrequented the Grand Rabbi's court in order to participate in prayers andmeals during the holidays and special Sabbaths.THE RABBI IS COMINGThe entire Jewsih population in our town and the surrounding villagesanticipated that day of the rabbi’s arrival with excitement and reverence.It was a great day in the history of our area. All students of the cheder(Hebrew School) prepared to walk two kilometers to the outskirts of the662 - The Bilker Memorial Booktown to greet the honored guests upon their arrival. 1 was among a classof nine"year"old boys to trod the crushed stone main road to meet therabbi who journeyed from his tometown to assume his new post.The students walked to the end of town with ribbons in hand whichthey carried like banners. The one exception was a simple flag that myfather had prepared for me with large Hebrew letters spelling "YECHr,meaning "LIVE".The long procession of students was followed by some elders of ourcommunity riding in two horse'drawn carriages. We were told that inthese carriages our new rabbi with his family would ride to the mainsynagogue. We were curious children, wanting to find out how the rabbilooked and to shake hands and say "Shalom Aleichem” to him. Our teacherhad instructed us that it was customary to kiss the rabbi’s hand when wegreeted him.As we climbed the road to the top of the hill at the edge of town, wesaw an approaching bus on the horizon. We rested at the sides of the road,waiting for the bus to halt in our midst. Soon we heard sounds of singingcoming from the people in the bus, and we had our first glimpse of thebearded faces at the windows. The Hebrew song of Psalms echoed: "Injoy they go forth and in peace they arrive”. When the bus stopped, thedoor opened and the first to step out was the elder Grand Rabbi of Spinka,wearing a shiny silk caftan and a spodik (sable fur hat) reserved forHassidic dignitaries.We all stood in awe and attention to see the face of a venerable spiritualgiant. The elders of our community surged toward the Spinker Rabbi fora "Shalom Aleichem" handshake and an opportunity to kiss the rabbi’shand " in homage to a Hassidic dynasty. Our new rabbi respectfullyfollowed his father, patriarch of Spinka. They were accompanied byyeshiva disciples who broke into song and shouts of joy.One yeshiva student chanted in Hebrew, "Long live ourMemories of Shtetl Life: - 663master'teacherTabbi", and all replied "Yechi", Hebrew for “live*. Theseecstatic chants were repeated continuously and the young cheder studentsquickly learned to respond, "Yechi! Yechi! Yechi!*Hearing these chants of * Yechi", I realized that this same word waswritten on my flag, in large red Hebrew letters. Instantly, I lifted my flaghigh, showing off my visual reinforcement to the word "Yechi!" I becamea celebrity in the eyes of my cheder classmates, who were excited to havein their group the only flag carrying a message for the event.1 rose to the occasion and used the flag in the same manner an orchestraconductor lifts a baton, each time the chants of "Yechi!" were repeated. Ibeamed with pride when my father watched me waving the flag he hadmade for me. It was a marvelous experience to be a part of that welcomingscene which made lasting impressions on all who participated. Throughoutmy life, even during the Holocaust years. 1 often had vivd flashbacks ofthe memory of that special day. The meaning of the word "Yechi!!" becamea slogan, a prayer and a hope for life.BILKER YESHIVA * A TURNING POINTThe arrival of the new rabbi marked a turning point in the history ofour small town. The town of Bilke became known as the seat of the newBilker Rabbi, who had an established reputation as a yeshiva leader in hisfather’s court. During the yeshiva’s first year, dozens of students frommany outlying villages in Carpathia and beyond flocked ot join the BilkerRabbi's yeshiva.The Jewish inhabitants of Bilke welcomed the prospects of a newyeshiva in their midst. Every household was canvassed personally byyeshiva students who wished to secure their daily meals. Manyhard'working families considered it a Mitzva, duty, and privilege to sharetheir meals with the worthy yeshiva students; thus, every student wasprovided with free meals.664 - The Bilker Memorial BookThis program was called "teg" (Yiddish for days). Many families gavewillingly and often prepared better meals on the days the the yeshivabachur had meals in their homes. In our own home, we offered meals fortwo yeshiva students one day each week.1 was young at the time but I had already noticed that we ate betteron a "yeshiva day". 1 looked forward to the time after my bar mitzva when1 would journey to a distant yeshiva. Not only was I imbued with a desireto study and experience yeshiva life. I also hoped that 1 would be treatedto better meals.In accordance with the accepted norm of every yeshiva in EasternEurope, the rabbi would lecture and teach the entire student body, free ofcharge. Small study groups learned their Talmud assignments daily form5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.Many students received "Smicha" (ordination) and eventually servedas spiritual leaders in various communities. The yeshiva gained fame forits scholarship and it soon began attracting students from the neighboringcountries of Rumania, Hungary, and Poland. Their presence in our towncreated a positive influence on the younger generations “ many of whomlater joined the yeshiva ranks, too. Bilke soon became an important shtetlwhich attracted many yeshiva youths who were seeking the fulfillment ofTorah.The events of the rabbi’s arrival were aweinspiring to me. When Igrew up to be a yeshiva student, I chose all Spinka"affiliated Yeshivot.First, the Yeshiva of Bilker Rav. Then "Yeshivat Meharam" in Humenne,Slovakia. Lastly, THE "SPINKA YESHIVA" in Sellish, of the venerableGrand Rabbi of Spinka, O.B.M.Iy,/. < >.hi1 iy" y -'-r > ..' 1• '''■y ( ■ • •• -v" '13 / /• !■r-'y h ' ■  'll■0. ^*^4^0/3"; r'' i \ ^r'-. if.

The women had thefirst task. On market day, which took place on a Tuesday, the womensearched out the very best quality ducks and geese. They were broughthome, and for the next few weeks, these birds were relentlessly fattened.They were actually forced to eat grains far beyond what they would haveeaten naturally.This was not, in truth, a practice in keeping with the Jewish law, whichforbids causing any living creature to suffer. In Jewish law it is called"Tz"ar Ba~alai Chayim". This stuffing "called "shtopen* in Yiddish wasnever practiced by mother. She was a very kind person and very observant.However, the majority of families in Bilke did it.When the birds were good and fat, the women took them down to oneof the six streams that crossed our town. There, they broke through theice of the frozen stream and washed the feathers of the birds so that theywould be good and clean. Then they took the birds to Rabbi Yehoshua,the "Shochet" or the ritual slaughterer. He slaughtered the ducks and geeseaccording to Jewish law. Taking the esophagus of the bird, he would blowit up like a balloon. If there was any scar, or any other evidence of sicknesson the tissue the bird would have to be disregarded because it was "Treifa*.If the duck or goose was "Kosher", Rabbi Yehoshua would cut off one legand keep it separately. This custom was practiced only during the months666 - The Bilker Memorial Bookof "Tevet" and "Shevat" corresponding to December and January in thegeneral calendar, depending on the Jewish calendar. This custom was pastdown from generation to generation, that one leg belonged to the "Shochet"during those months.When Rabbi Yehoshua accumulated a number of these legs, he woulddistribute them to the poor people of Bilke. This gift kept many of themalive. An especially delicious and nourishing dish they would make iscalled "Pe'cheh". This was a kind of gelatin, made from the feet in whichthe meat was bathed and also preserved.The ample fat from these birds was most important. It was renderedoff and sealed into glass jars, not to be used until Passover. As the wintersin the Carpathian Mountains were very cold, there was no problem ofspoilage. As for the feathers, these were used for pillows and quilts. Themeat itself, of course, was eaten right away.About the same time the first steps were also taken to prepare thewheat for grinding into flour for the "Matzoth". On a winter’s night,neighbors would gather in one home or another around a long absolutelyclean table, covered with a tablecloth. There could be no question or evena single particle of "chametz" or leavened bread, being hidden on itssurface. Wheat would be spilled over the table. With care the neighborswould pick through the kernels of the wheat, removing the impurities ‘chaff, stones, something or a bug. Even a split kernel was cast aside. Inthis way, they ended up with the very best wheat available. There weresome families in Bilke who bought regular wheat for Passover. But themore observant like our family, bought only special wheat which had beenliterally watched over, from the moment it was cut in the field until thetime it came out of the oven. Above all, this wheat had to stay dry, so thatit would not accidentally start to rise or leaven. The "Matzah’ baked fromthis special wheat is known as "Matzah Shmurah"" which means "GuardedMatzah". Among those who bought only this kind of wheat where myfamily and of course the family of the Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Weiss and aThe Holiday of Passover - 667few others.Before the "Matzoth" could be made for the Jewish community ofBilke, it had to be decided who will get the concession to produce the"Matzoth". This was a decision which was put to a vote by the elders ofthe community. They gathered for that purpose at least two months beforePassover in the side chapel of the Great Synagogue. The advantage of thischapel was that it was heated, unlike the synagogue itself, by awoodbuming stove. This chapel served in winter time for worship, studyand also for community meetings and affairs.In Bilke we had about six different families who competed for theconcession to bake the "Matzoth' for the community. In Hebrew they arecalled "Ba"a“ley Bafeem" " or members. They were :Reb MeshulamFriedman, Reb David Aharon Reissman, Reb Noach Mechlovitch andothers. These men would submit, by sealed bid, the price per kilo at whichthey would deliver the "Matzoth" to the community. A low price wasessential because so many of the people were poor. Yet the eating ofMatzah, which symbolized the bread of affliction and the journey fromEgypt, was a "Mitzvah" a good deed, which had to be made affordable tothe poorest of the poor.The sealed envelopes were opened by the "Rosh Ha"ka“hal", thepresident of the community Chaim Isaac Rosenbaum. All the bids wereread aloud. That year, the lowest bid had been submitted by Reb MeshulamFriedman. In addition, to the low price, this was a man who had othergood qualities and points in his favor. He was a "melamed" a teacher inone of the better "Chadarim" " Hebrew schools. He also was a religiousman, a "Yareh Sha"ma“yim one who "feared heaven".With six streams flowing down from the mountains and through Bilke,there was no lack of water“powered mills. Each year, the Jews of our townnegotiated the rent of these mills, a month or two before Passover, so thatthe holiday wheat could be ground into flour. Since most of these mills668 - The Bilker Memorial Bookbelonged to gentiles, the negotiating could be delicate. Some of the ownersdid not want to give up their mills for such a short period of time as wasrequired to grind the flour. Others, although they never explicitly said it,didn't want to rent to Jews.That year, the community did rent a mill. It was in the outlying suburbof Kolbasovo. Early one morning, a small group of Bilker Jews set out ina wagon to go to "kasher"" make the mill fit for Passover use. There wasReb David Aharon Reissman, the "shamash" " sexton, Reb MeshulumFriedman, the "melamed” " teacher, who had the concession to bake the"matzoth" and the sons of the "Shochet" " Chaim Leib and ShlomoYeshayah and also after crying and begging,the youngest son Moshelehwas finally allowed to join. For him it was an occasion which he neverforgot.All the machinery of the mill and especially the grinding stone wheelitself were thoroughly scrubbed, so as to be utterly free of any taint of"Chametz"" leavened bread. This meant not only sweeping and scrubbingevery surface but also burning the surface of the grinding stones with hotcoal. That is how thoroughly it had to be done.When the process of "Kashering" was complete, the Rabbi of ourcommunity. Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Weiss, was called to inspect the premisesif eveything is according to "Halacha" " Jewish Code of Law. Once hegave his okay the grinding of the Passover flour commenced. The firstwheat to be ground was the wheat for "Matzah Shmurah". The reason forit was because if the regular wheat had been grounded first it wouldobviously bring down the "Matzah Shmurah” to the level of the regular"Matzah" through contact and contamination. So the the purest was thefirst ground.This process of preparing the mill took all day and into the night. Itwas very late when our wagon finally returned home. Little Moshele wasbragging to the other boys of Bilke, how he alone had been allowed toThe Holiday of Passover - 669f < yfi ' .//<S'''•'K'- ' •i. ^ ^ r''-, .f■ J-Wi^ ■* t *, •« • ''■/■ >V\ • •' ‘■'<m:F.r'-\O \   /'■:;i W '<'tv'SKonanii . . V-take part in the important "Mitzvah’ of that day.One of the nice things about Reb Meshulum Friedman's winning theconcession to bake the "Matzoth" was that he had to dismiss his school afew days earlier than usual so that he could commence the preparationsfor the baking of the "Matzoth”. We students were full of joy that the"Cheder" school was ending earlier. Moshele was in the habit of wanderingaround the building where the community oven was located. In thecommunity building three activities were going on. The "Bait Hashchita"■ the slaughter house, the community oven and a "Cheder" “Hebrew school.Moshele liked to observe how the "Matzoth” were baked. All was ofinterest ot him: who was bringing the flour, how many "Matzoth" werebaked, and so on. Sometimes, he was even given a little piece of "Matzah"to nibble. He was also allowed, from time to time to pierce the holes inthe rolled out dough wich kept the "Matzah” from rising.The oven, which served all year round, for cooking the "Chulent", bythe way was "kashered"as thoroughly as the mill had been. Besides beingswept clean all over and around the rooms, the oven was fired up a fulltwenty four hours to make sure all the "Chametz" “ leavened bread wasburnt out.After a while, Moshele got up his courage and went up to RebMeshulum his teacher “ who had the concession to bake the "Matzoth",and said "Rabbi, I have a request, maybe you could hire me to make holesin the "Matzoth", here you can see I did it a few times already". ToMoshele’s surprise he said yes.The process of producing the "Matzoth" started immediately afterPurim. Only pious women were chosen to roll out the dough. Any youngwoman who was not, from a moral point of view, impeccable, was passedover. This was a decision which Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Weiss himself madeon each women who applied for work. The kneading of the dough washard work and it was done by the men. No juice, no salt or any other670 - The Bilker Memorial Bookmaterial was added to the flour. This was to fulfill the commandment inthe Bible "seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, the bread ofaffliction: for thou earnest out of the land of Egypt in haste (Deut. 16:3).The water for making the "Matzah" dough had to be drawn from springwater the night before because of the possibility for the water to become"Chametz". It says in the Talmud tractate "Pesachim 94" in daytime wellsare cold, and warm at night". This water which is drawn before eveningis called "Mayim Shelanu" ‘ water which stayed warm over night. So oneis supposed to knead the flour only with water that has stayed the nightin a cistern. As a double precaution, when this water was poured into thebarrel, it was strained to be sure that no "Chametz" got into the water.There was a "Mashgiach"" a supervisor who watched over the womenas they rolled out the dough. He hurried them up because after eighteenminutes from the moment the dough was ready to roll and to put into theoven, the dough becomes "Chametz". It happens very fast. Once the doughwas brought to the table where it was pierced, it was folded over a verylong stick and brought to the oven.The man actually in charge of the oven was Reb David AvaronReissman. It was the job of a young lad to bring to Reb David Aharonthe unbaked "Matzah" on a paddle at the end of a very long narrow rollingpin. The "Matzoth" would be laid across the paddle side by side. Reb DavidAharon would then thrust this paddle deep into the hot oven wiggling androlling it so that the individual "Matzoth" would come off and lie in anorderly row. This took quite some skill. But he had done it before foryears and he knew what he was doing.The baking lasted no more than two minutes; maybe even less, theoven was very hot and the "Matzoth" very thin so that was all the time ittook. Then Reb David Aharon used a wooden spatula, also with a longhandle, to slide out the "Matzoth". Each family brought its own flour,which they grounded in the "Kashered" mill, to the community oven andwm / / ^ m * • w' ■' • v'i '-f/A•feKa. .rf-r - ^ X'A.V.- V* ^ V . «,4v f •l , >v. ••• v;. ^■V '.W.- .-" 'K •A .>/'•' /f'i •mi ■'' ?

The family to whom acertain batch belonged would hold out a large basket and in it the hotbaked "Matzoth" would go and then took them home. This was theprocedure by which the Jews of Bilke prepared the "Matzoth” for Passover.In the house of the Shochet's family there was a big commotion beforePassover. The entire house was painted. From each room, all the furniturewas removed and the house was cleaned thoroughly, and the entire housewas in every way renewed. From the 13th day of Nissan, one day beforePassover began, nobody would go into the house without first removingtheir shoes. That's how strictly things were done. It was Miriam. One ofthe five daughters of the "Shochet" who was in charge of preparing thehouse for "Pesach". She devoted herself to this task, not only putting thehouse in order before the Passover but also before each Shabbat and otherholidays. She did it not only with attention to tiny details, but also withenthusiasm.Two days before "Pesach" we took down from the attic the special"Pesachdikeh" dishes. These were well covered and locked in a trunk sothat G"d forbid no "Chametz" should sneak in. From the oldest to theyoungest, the whole family stood in a line beneath the ladder leading tothe attic door, as item by item, the Passover plates, pots and other utensilswere passed down. Each member of the family had some dish or otherthat was personally favored. In the case of Moshele, it was the salt waterdish, made from crystal. Each year when this bowl was handed down fromthe attic, he was so happy with it. It was as if he had found a treasure allover again.The Passover dishes were washed and dried and put on the table as ifon exhibition, so that everyone could see these beautiful dishes.In the house of the "Shochet" there were two ovens “ one for cookingmeat and one for dairy. Mrs. Pearl Doft, the wife of the "Shochet" allowedno crossovers, G"d forbid that a dairy dish should be put on the meat672 - The Bilker Memorial Bookoven, or vice versa. Before "Pesach" Mrs. Pearl Doft kept the ovens goingfor twenty four hours, just as the "Matzah" oven in the communal building,in order to make it absolutely "Kosher" for "Passover”. Such kinds ofcleaning, nobody saw in any house in Bilke. If even one granule of"Chametz" had been left after cleaning of the ovens, it was surely burnedaway by this long period of firing.Also the tables were washed and scrubbed. Then, to protect them, athin, tin cover was put over them which were stored in the attic from yearto year. Although the home of the "Shochet" was always very clean yearround, at "Pesach" time there was a special brightness, a special whiteness.On Passover Eve, Reb Yehoshua came home from "Shul" andperformed "Bedikat Chametz" " the search for the leavened bread. Thismeant that he went around the house checking to see if any "Chametz"had accidentally been left. In order that one does not pronounce a blessingin vain, someone in the family placed small crumbs here and there. Witha candle, a feather and wooden spoon in hand, Reb Yehoshua collected thecrumbs and placed them in the wooden spoon. He recited the Blessing "A1Biur Chametz" “ meaning that we were commanded to clear out the"Chametz" from the house.All the "Chametz” that had been collected was wrapped in a cloth andput away until morning. Then before ten a.m. (this was a very strict limitof time), Reb Yehoshua and his sons went out in the yard and made a fire.Into the flames they tossed the wooden spoon, the feather and the clothwith the crumbs. As it burned, they recited the formula of "Kol Chamira”.It is a vow that any "Chametz’ still in the house, which somehow hadescaped notice, should now be declared not to exist. It is a kind of legaldeclaration similar to selling the”Chametz' to a non Jew.In the afternoon on "Erev Pesach" " Passover Eve, a group of men "the elite of the community gathered at the communal oven.

There were there to bake the "Matzoth Mitzvah". At this time,only men did the entire work, the rolling of the dough, the perforation ofit, so that it would no rise, and the cutting. As they worked they weresinging "Hallel" “ the songs of praise to G"d from the Passover service.In this way the men themselves have had the experience of baking thepassoved "Matzah" which is a great "mitzvah". Of course, Reb Yehoshuaand his six sons, who had lovely voices, were singing most of the time,and the whole atmosphere was very beautiful and very uplifting. Whenthe baking was done each family rushed home with the "Mitzvah Matzoth"that he had baked.Reb Yehoshua Doft did not forget to send some of these "MitzvahMatzoth" to some "Baalei Batim", the important members in thecommunity. Moshele and his older brother Yoseleh, who was two and ahalf years older, would bring packages of "Mitzvah Matzoth" to these"Baalei Batim". Moshele especially liked to make these deliveries becausehe would get a tip from the recipients of these packages.In the meantime, the women of the Doft family were at home preparingthe Passover Table. All the fine dishes were there and polished candlestickswith special large candles “ so they would last throughout the "Seder", thered sweet wine for the "Arba Kosoth" “ four cups, the "Ka"rah" the Sederplate, and "Kos Eliyahu" " the cup of Elijah the Prophet. There was alsoa cup for each member of the family, as well as salt water and "MitzvahMatzoth". At the head of the table a couch was placed with pillows. Thiswas to enact on the part of the leader of the "Seder," the "Mitzvah" of"ha“sa“vah" reclining. It is to symbolize that we are free people.When the sun set into the trees, Mrs, Pearl Doft lit the candles. Shewore a beautiful white dress with a kerchief on her head that alwaysin nis loud yet sweet voice ne sang tirst tne "borcnu' using a special ornatemelody which is designated for the three festivals in the Jewish calendar.Reb Yehoshua and his six sons were a choir known not only in Bilke butin the surrounding towns. Since this was "Lail Shimurim"" a night whenthe guardians of Israel watch over the Jewish people, as well as a nightwhen a Seder had yet to take place, lasting into the wee hours of the night.Reb Yehoshua actually finished the service with a bit of extra speed. Assoon as the "Mafariv" evening service was over, the synagogue quicklyemptied out as each one rushed off to his home to start the Seder. Burningcandles were seen from all the Jewish homes, which created a spiritualatmosphere.As the men entered the house they said "Chag Sameach" a joyousholiday, the women answered with the same greeting. Reb Yehoshua putThe Holiday of Passover - 67S"Melech" and "Malkah". Their faces were shining as they looked with joyat their clean house, their beautiful table and their special family.Reb Yehoshua now turned to those seated around the table. "Pesach"is a holiday he said "that unites our people, wherever they may be, nowand throughout the generations. The cup of Elijah symbolizes theannouncer of the redemption and the hope of our people. The melodieswe sing, have, likewise been passed on to us from previous generations.The symbols of the Passover table and the stories told in the "Haggadah"emphasize this continuity of our people. The suffering we have undergonethroughout the generaions has strengthened our resolve so that, even asenemies rise up against us anew, G"d saves us from them." Then RebYehoshua said Moshele, since you are the youngest in the family, nowyou begin with "Kadesh". This is a listing of the ten parts of the "Seder",a sort of index of the "Seder" ritual. Moshele sang "Kadesh," then heexplained that it means that one fills the first cup of wine and a blessingis recited over it. Chaim Leib, the oldest son in the family, then filled upall the cups. Reb Yehoshua stood up and all in the family also rose. Hesang the "Kiddush" over the wine according to the Passover melody. "G’dchose us over all other peoples". He said, "to celebrate this holiday withjoy ■ a holiday of the "Matzoth", a holiday of freedom". After RebYehoshua had recited the "Kiddush", each son also recited the "Kiddush"one after the other.Then Moshele announced the next part of the Seder "Urchatz" "washing of the hands. All the men went to a bowl and washed their hands.Moshele went on saying the order of the "Seder". "Yachatz", Reb Yehoshuatook the middle "Matzah," symbolizing the tribe of "Levy" and broke it inhalf. The larger half, he put into a cloth and hid it away for the" Afikoman"(until it is found at the end of the "seder" the service cannot be concluded.It is the children who search for the "Afikoman" “the hidden "Matzah,"and a prize is awarded to the one who finds it.

One type was larger pieces and the otherwas ground. The women and youngsters only ate that which was grounda little bit milder. The men ate both. After quite a long time, Moshelefinally announced "Shulchan Orech" meaning set the table for the meal!When the women heard the signal, they began to serve all the courses.At this moment a very relaxed atmosphere existed in the house. With greatsatisfaction the women listened to the praises and compliments theyreceived from the men with each new dish that they presented. When themeal was at last finished, Moshele announced "Tzafun" meaning that the"Afikoman" the hidden "Matzah" should be presented and each personshould eat a piece from it, a "Kzayit" at least the size of an olive. ThenReb Yehoshua turned around to look for the "Afikoman", which he hid.He suspected that Moshele, who was sitting on his left probably took it.Reb Yehoshua turned to Moshele and said to him: "Okay, what should Igive you to get back the "Afikomani" Moshele thought about this for amoment and then said: "For Passover you bought me new shoes. ForShavuot" which is coming in seven weeks I want you to buy me a newsuit". "Let it be so" said Reb Yehoshua. Moshele brought forth the"Afikoman" from the place where he hid it. Only then was the family ableto continue with the "Seder" ritual as it is supposed to be.When the Doft family reached the paragraph "Shfoch Cha“mat"cha"meaning "Pour out thy wrath at those who have been persecuting theJewish people", Yosele was asked to go to the front door and open it for678 - The Bilker Memorial Book"Eliyahu Hanavi"" Elijah the Prophet, It is believed by the Jewish peoplethat at this moment at the "Seder" Elijah comes into Jewish homes and hetakes a sip of wine from the cup designated for him. The entire familyrose to their feet, and with great feeling recited this passage in the"Haggadah" which tells of the tremendous injustices which have beenbrought upon the Jewish people throughout the generations. The childrenlooked to see, during the recitation, if Elijah had really been drinking fromthe cup. The door was closed and the Doft family continued to recite andsing the rest of the "Haggadah". When it came to the sentence "LeshanahHabaah Beyrushalayim "Next year in Jerusalem" the entire family joinedin the singing with a special feeling. From all the Jewish houses in Bilke,such passsages could be heard as, "G"d "build soon your house!"...Themighty one will soon build his house!" "Soon, you will lead the afflictedones to Zion in joy and in song!" It was much after midnight when RebYehoshua and his family completed the "Seder" in high spirits.During Passover, the elders of the community in Bilke recounted eventsthat had happened in Bilke many years before. Events which left atremendous impression. Here is such a story. It happened on Passoverholiday some years back when the Christian Easter holiday coincided with"Pesach". This always caused tension in the Jewish community. The Jewstried, during this period, not to show themselves too much in the eyes ofthe gentile population, in order not to arouse them. All the Jewishcelebrations were a little restrained, so that there should be no pretext fortrouble. This was something that in Jewish history, happened more thanonce.The Christians in Bilke had a legend that during Easter week, the bellsof their big church flew away to Rome. Obviously during the entire Easterperiod no bells rang in Bilke. Now there was a certain Jewish family inBilke which had been there for many generations and had grownprosperous. One branch of the family owned a store, another a bank, stillanother handled big real estate transactions involving fields and vineyards.The Holiday of Passover - 679If/.-VT.•H’ •»•^11’•ir'''iefl.i P(?5TS»a.X.A 4 # 'i? x *r• \ 5?''fS.iW,^;\■^^%. -4ktf^ -Kaof/ l.' ■ ' ’-^'■'r'.r'‘'4-'-'In short they were well to do. The name off the family was Friedman.They lived not far from the great synagogue. One of the sons of thefamily was "Yitzchak". One would say that he was not "all there". He hadto be kept on a chain in order not to run away and perhaps hurt people.By nature, he was so violent that not even his closest family memberscould control him.Only Reb Shmuel Mayer Klein, who had been a teacher of smallchildren could handle him at all. Being very old he had retired. But hefound a way of handling this young man "Yitzchak". This "Yitzchak"actually liked the old man.Reb Shmuel Mayer would help him get dressed, feed him, and ingeneral attend to his needs and handle him very gently. Although, RebShmuel Mayer was not a doctor or psychologist, he knew how to dealwith the disturbed young man. He was a man simply bom with a knackfor it. He was easy going and a jokester. If you asked him how old he was,he would tell you in terms of "Bar Mitzvas;" "I was already six times BarMitzvah".On the first day of Pesach of that year, which was also the first dayof Easter week, Reb Shmuel Mayer came, as usual, to Yitzchak the insaneone. When he came into the room, he saw at once, or rather sensed thatthere was some change that had come over "Yitzchak". What this changewas; however, he was not able to say. "Take off the chain from my leg"the insane "Yitzchak" said suddenly "only for a few minutes”. Reb ShmuelMayer was afraid to oblige him, fearing that he would run away. But"Yitzchak suddenly hit the old man on the head and then grabbed one ofhis "Payot" " side curls, and tore it out, "If you don't unchain me I'll ripout your other "Payah" " side curl, "the insane man said.The old man saw that he had no choice. He unlocked the chain thatbound "Yitzchak". The insane man began running like a wild animal. Bythe time Reb Shmuel Mayer had fetched the other members of the family680 - The Bilker Memorial Bookto search the grounds, it was as if the ground had swallowed him up.On this first day of Pesach of that year, the Jews of Bilke gathered inthe great synagogue to give thanks the Almighty for their freedom. It wasspring, of course, and the weather was already beautiful. The leader of"Pesukai Dezimrah” of the preliminary service had just finsihed, when RebYehoshua began the "Shacharit" service according to the special festivalmelodies. The entire congregation had been waiting for this, and eachword, each melody, elicited in them great joy.Reb Yehoshua was also a composer of melodies. For each holiday, hewould try out new tunes. The members of the community listenedcarefully, and afterwards each one gave his opinion. Reb Mayer Berger,who was also a bit melodic, said "L'eyla U'leyla" meaning "superb superb”.During the "Shacharit" " morning service, Reb Yehoshua especiallyshowed his strength in the prayers called "Yotzrot" and in the "Piyut" "poem called "Brach Dodi". When he reached the "Hallel" he poured outhis heart to G"d. Each line had a special rhythm, a cerain musical meter.When he reached the passage "Yisrael, Yisrael B'tach Ba'shem”" "Israeltrust in G'd" he would twist it and ornament it with the trill of this voice,with various innuendoes and shadings. In certain of these passages, RebYehoshua and his sons sang in harmony. Chaim Leib and Shmuel Tsvisang the bass, Nachum Uri and ShlomoYeshayah were the baritones, andthe two youngest, Yoseleh and Moshele, were on the high notes. Abovethem, however, was their father Reb Yehoshua.After the Torah reading, Reb Yehoshua sang a special melody for theparagraph called "Ya’eyli" " "You are my G'd". It was in the form of amarch, as if we are marching toward G'd". Before the "Musaf'' additionalservice, Reb Yehoshua put on a white gown for the singing of "TefilatTal" ' the prayer for dew. He introduced this prayer by saying: "I amtrying to express the secret existence of our people". And by this heactually prayed for dew for the land of Israel rather than there in theCarpathian Mountains, which did not count on this source of water for\ •. /• . ii.-f • S/ •• * ■«* \'\ \ ^ XI i -* ■'"'y \ ^The Holiday of Passover - 681crops. In Israel, this was the date that the dry season usually began.Reb Yehoshua continued with the passage which asks that this shouldbe a year of blessing and not curse, of life and not death, of bounty andnot hunger. His voice echoed through the synagogue and it was heard allover. Twice a year Reb Yehoshua would sing this special melody, onPesach, the prayer of "Tal" “for dew, and on *Shmini Atzeret* for"Geshem" " for rain. At the end of the service, each person came up toReb Yehoshua to shake his hand and tell him their delight in his singingof the prayers.It was noon. The Jews were just leaving the synagogue. The gentileswere going about their holiday business. Suddenly, the bells of the churchbegan to ring. The town was filled with the echo of the bells. Everyonewas stunned. People looked up to the church tower and asked "What washappening?" Because everyone, Jew as well as gentile knew that accordingto the legend the bells were supposed to be in Rome. Not for three moredays, at the end of the Easter week, were they supposed to return to Bilke.The people of the town ran towards the church where the bellscontinued to ring wildly. This was no melodious, gentle ringing as usual,but rather a wild urgent cacophony, as if the devil himself was in the belltower. The young, the elderly, everyone crowded around the front of thechurch. There was a sense of fright, and also anger among the gentiles.Abruptly, the ringing stopped. The sextant of the church, accompaniedby several of the gentiles, climbed up into the tower. There they foundYitzchak Friedman the insane. Roughly, they brought him down. As thecrowd saw who it was, hate welled up in them. They were ready, on thespot to lynch the offender. The "Goyim" ” the gentiles were expressingthe hatred of generations which had accumulated in their hearts. Theybegan to beat Yitzchak the insane.Suddenly, shouts of the police were heard: "Keep away! Keep away!They broke through the mob and rescued Yitzchak the insane, who by682 - The Bilker Memorial Booknow was beaten nearly to death. But he still had the strength to shout ina clear voice, "1 am a Jew! You see the bells of the church did not fly toRome!" Having shouted this with his last effort, he fell to the ground.This incident shook up all the inhabitants of Bilke. The gentiles weretotally confused. The Jews feared that this incident would cause even morehate for them than had been felt before. Who knew what the next daywould bring upon them?The holidays ended without further incident. All continued about theirusual business as if the whole bizarre thing had neve happened. But theJews of Bilke saw in Yitzchak the insane " or "Meshugener" somethingof a wonder. Who can evaluate a Jewish soul? Some asked and wondered.Those who pondered on the happening a little deeper also asked, whoknows? Perhaps this Yitzchak is the reincarnation of a soul from a previouslife who had sinned and who had to do this act of "Kiddush Hashem" "the sanctification of the name of G"d, in order to redeem himself.

Rf(oil51H;iMemories of "Kolbasovo"a suburb of Bilke - 683Memories of "Kolbasovo"asuburb of BilkeBy: Frank Colb (Efrayim Josovic)It was said that Bilke was, territorially speaking, as large as the cityof Budapest. That of course was an exaggeration I am sure. Nervertheless,the town of Bilke with a population of ten thousand covered a largeterritory. In Bilke there were a number of suburbs consisting of subcommunities, some closer and some further away from the center of town."Kolbasovo" was one such suburb " about a half hour walk from thecenter of Bilke. The Jewish community in "Kolbasovo" consisted of aboutthirty Jewish families at the time of the expulsion of the Jews by the localcollaborators with the Hungarian Nazis “ The "Nylos Party" may theirname be eradicated.About one third of the Jews of "Kolbasovo" together with a numberof Jewish families of Bilke proper were expelled from their homes inAugust 1941, and driven to Kaminetz, Podolsk in the Ukraine where allwere executed by the Germans, the Hungarians, the Ukrainians and othercollaborators.I was still at home when in 1941 a demand was made by the Hungariansthat all Jews of the Carpatians must present proof of their citizenship asfar as 1850. There was a scramble to obtain documents. For that purpose,I and many others traveled to Budapest to obtain the proper documentsfrom the census records in the Budapest archives to prove that they livedin Bilke in those years during the Austro“Hungarian rule.I was one of those who traveled to Budapest to try to get documentation684 - The Bilker Memorial Bookfor our family and 1 was successful. 1 remember standing in front of thoseoffices for days together with hundreds of other Jews before my turn cameto enter. The Hungarians charged hefty fees for those documents.All this citizenship business was only a pretext, a cunning deceptionto mislead us into believing that there was still a future for the Jews ofHungary. To the sorrow of of many Carpatian Jews, those who couldn’tcome up with those documents were brutally expelled and annihilated.Also in 1941 the Hungarians mobilized all able bodied men ages 18~50into "Munko Tabor"" "Forced Labor Camps". I myself was taken to manyand varied places where I was shoved and pushed, and marched, andworked to the bone. 1 was liberated on the 9th of May 1945 inTheresienstadt.I was, and am the only survivor of my immediate family of sevenchildren, four brothers and three sister, six nieces and nephews. We hada Synagogue in the "Kolbasovo" a nice and relatively modem buildingwith a tin roof which, in addition to the "shul" also housed the community’Cheder" Hebrew school. That's where I attended "Cheder" for many years.It is interesting to relate how the synagogue was built. My greatgrandfather Reb Yosef Chayim Josovic, who was a relatively well to doman (he owned a brewery making "shlivovitz" from locally grown plums)built the first synagogue in "Kolbasovo"" a small wooden structure. RebYosef Chayim Josovic died in the year 1901.At the turn of the twentieth century, two sons of Reb Zelig Josovic,the grandchildren of Reb Yosef Chayim emigrated to the U.S.A. In theyear 1913, these two grandsons came home to Bilke for a visit. One Shabbatthey came to the "Kolbasovo" to visit their uncle, my grandfather RebMoshe. While attending services that Shabbat morning in the old "BetHamidrash" they were given "Aliyot" to the Torah as honored guests. Theypledged to build a new synagogue during their "Mee Shebayrach" as adonation for the honor bestowed upon them. That was the synagogue thatN*' ^yf R,f«,ip33!CKa ,.-r.>. /a m*, a' / * *' /ZMemories of "Kolbasovo'a suburb of Bilke - 685\ 'v 'f- 'M i...f,\i >s"V ■ ■'VIYxi c_, I'■ ''‘- y tMkIk’/ V . r*HGRi3H^?,<iS^ / V •./^ Sxvt,i4^OP0Mifiserved the community of the "Kolbasovo* so well till the "Churban* thedestruction of our people.For a livelihood, the people engaged in various activities.

Most of the people were poor, to the point that therewere days during the week when there was no bread in the house. Thereis not one Jew left there anymore. The majority were murdered atAuschwitz and other concentration camps, in the forced labor camps andother places.

(Talmud Pesachim p.ll9).The terrible Nazi holocaust which destroyed the Jewish communitiesof Europe, also uprooted great personalities and heads of families, whoserved as wonderful and exceptional examples to the Jews who lived intheir midst. The tragic events which befell the Jews of the East Europeantowns, destroyed the pure and upright way of life, which was sanctifiedby the many generations who, sacrificed their lives for the Torah and itscommandments. The tragic holocaust interrupted the continued rich Torahcreativity, which was prevalent in Eastern Europe before the destruction.In this article, I wish to create a memorial for my beloved grandfatherRabbi Abraham Lipschitz " his blessed memory. I see it as a duty to createa spiritual memorial for my family, my community and my people. Manywonderful memories come to mind, about marvellous and revered images,who lived a creative life before the consuming fire destroyed it all. Awicked hand devastated everything, it did not pity even the young Yeshivastudents or the righteous scholars.Rabbi Abraham Lipschitz, the son of Rabbi Shabsai Lipschitz, was oneof those spiritual leaders, a popular revered and beloved personality inthe town of Bilke and vicinity in the Carpathian Mountains. Rabbi ShabsaiLipschitz who was the chief judge of the Jewish court of the town ofIrshava and the entire county, became known as a great scholar and author.698 - The Bilker Memorial Bookwho wrote some fifteen books on Jewish laws and customs, as well asmedical and psychological advice.Rabbi Abraham was bom in the town of Stretin in Galicia where hisfamily then resided. When he was a young lad, he and his familyimmigrated to the Carpathian Mountains, in order to avoid the draft ofRabbi Shabsai to the Austro'Hungarian army, and to serve as a spiritualleader to the Jews of that area, who were in need of scholars and spiritualleaders.Rabbi Avrum’che, as he was lovingly called by his followers, wasappointed as a judge of the town of Zalizshe near the city of Mukachevo.After a short while he was appointed chief judge in the nearby town ofZavidov. He married Rachel Yitte, the daughter of Rabbi Chayim LeibKahana, a descendant of the ”Noda Beyehuda” Rabbi Ezekiel Landa, thechief Rabbi of Prague, Czechoslovakia. Rachel Yitte’s geneology fromhere mother’s side reaches all the way to Rashi, and from her father’s sideall the way to Ezra the scribe. She was beautiful, a real woman of valor,a strong personality, a righteous person and a great help to her husband.In the year 1911 a young man by the name of Joel Teitlebaum arrived inthe town of Irshava. He later became known as the Rabbi of Satmar (whichis located in Romania) who caused great strife in many of the CarpathianMountain communities.At that time Rabbi Shabsai, the father of Rabbi Abraham Lipschitz,served as chief judge of Irshava. When Rabbi Joel Teitlebaum was askedwhat his intentions were in the town, he answered that he had no plans,he just liked to live in this town. However, soon after his arrival, he startedto infringe on Rabbi Shabsai’s and other professional’s territory. He triedto impose himself on various communities by threats and blackmail anddemanded that they follow his dictates. He disqualified the ritualslaughterers or Shochatim who were deeply committed, religious andobservant, who refused to follow him since they adhered to the greatRabbis and judges of that time for many years before him.There Was a Chasid - 699ii'.'^ .

V"' ■;' ‘V'.;/ A -Some twelve towns and villages which comprised the county of Irshavarefused to accept the authority of Rabbi Joel Teitlebaum and followedRabbi Chayim Elazar Shapiro, the chief Rabbi of Munkatch. The followersof Rabbi Teitlebaum started to bully the people and introducedhooliganism which was foreign to Jewish behavior. This fight by RabbiTeitlebaum was not for the sake of sanctifying the name of G“d. Heintroduced an extremism which was never practiced among Jews before.The great Rabbis of the vicinity held a "Din'Torah" a trial, and RabbiTeitlebaum was forced to leave. He later lived in the city of Krula andfrom there in 1928 he settled in Satmar.The dispute and the antagonism with Rabbi Teitlebaum and hisfollowers also strongly affected Rabbi Abraham Lipschitz who was thenjudge in Zalizshe. In the introduction to this book "Yalkut Avraham", heexpressed his frustration and anger toward the Satmarer and his followersin the following words: "I was persecuted and tormented by wicked people,informers, gossipers, and betrayers, however with the grace of G“d he wasnot able to harm me, and if not our holy Torah I would have perished inmy suffering".In the year 1926, Rabbi Abraham moved from Zalizshe to the town ofBilke. In Bilke, Rabbi Abraham's family became a sort of specialinstitution. They represented a real solid deep rooted Jewish family. Theypossessed a deep and comprehensive religious belief. The entire familyhad a natural noble and aristocratic posture. They had five sons and twodaughters. They all excelled in their studies, knowledge and abilities. Thiswas an exceptional family, one of its kind. Rabbi Abraham's family wasthe pride of the town. All boasted about them from young to old. Thefamily had great distinction for generations. Its branches spread to anumber of countries. In this family one could find Torah, greatness andleadership in one place.All the inhabitants of the area, among them great scholars, had greatrespect for Rabbi Avrum'che. He was a scholar with great ability for700 - The Bilker Memorial Bookwriting, which he seemed to have inherited from his father. From his fertilepen he brought forth the important book "Yalkut Avraham". The bookdeals with commentaries on the Torah, interpretations on Halach, Agada(Legends) commentaries, Remez (hints). Brush (homily) and Sod (hiddensecrets). The book has three parts, the first one is called "Yalkut Avraham"(Anthology of Abraham) which deals with the four sections of theShulchan Aruch (The Code of Jewish Law). The second part is called"Vayosef Avraham" (and Avraham continued) which deals with theimportance of the study of Torah. The third part is called "Avraham Ezkor”(Avraham Remembered) which deals with explanations of laws andcustoms concerning Shochatim and Mohalim. The other part is called"Rimzei Breshis" (hints in the word Breishis) which gives us clues forinterpretation.The book was first published in Czechoslavakia in the year 1931. Thebook made a great impression among scholars and Rabbis. Great Rabbisof that time gave their "Haskama," approval, of the book and praised ithighly. Among those that endorsed it were: Rabbi Chayim Elazar Shapiroof Munkatch, Rabbi Leib Winkler of Madi, Rabbi Shabsai Lipschits thefather of the author. Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Weis of Bilke who was the sonof the Sepinker Rabbi, and many others. It is interesting to bring a fewquotations of their endorsements: "His innovations and hints are pleasantand wonderful". "He assembled precious stones in his anthology". "Theirreasons and arguments are sweeter than honey and nectar to the tastebuds". "He made decorations and flowers for the Torah". "His words areinspiring to men and G"d alike". "His words are lovely and sweet whichentice the hearts of men". "They are full of splendor and radiate brightness".His devotion to the study of Torah knew no limits. In his introductionto his book. Rabbi Abraham tells us how important the Holy Books wereto him. He knew that the "Book" is the homeland of the Jews, theirpossession, their luck and their domain. Nobody can exile them from thebook. There is a good reason why the Jews are called "The People of theThere Was a Chasid - 701A. rs-■ \ ■'y “ '\<f f/'^.y r-.' ‘ ^ '■ . • ; -A' ■ •'>•»A ' " '*. A-' • •. " iCv4;V Ajy^yy^opom" y ''^Book”. Although Rabbi Abraham lived a difficult financial and pressinglife, he made every effort to purchase religious books from various sources,since he devoted all his life to the study of Torah.He describes his thirst for books in the following words"Although Iam lacking many books, I have bought a few books which are my life. Ipurchased them with difficulty and poverty. G"d Almighty is my witnessthat many times I was hungry for food because I was not able to affordboth".His book also reached the U.S.A. in the 1930’s, this saved the bookfrom being forgotten. After the Holocaust, in 1962, the book was reprintedin New York by his sons, grandchildren and his admirers. Special creditshould be given to Mr. Yeshaya Karpen of Brooklyn, a grandson of theauthor, whose efforts made it possible to spread his fountain of knowledgeamong the new generations.Rabbi Abraham was a Tzadik (Righteous) and faultless person, honestin his ways and a wise sage. A sharp mind and deeply knowledgable inall the intricacies of the Torah. For many years his book served as a specialsource for study and direction to many of East European Jewry. Todaythere is renewed interest in his book among Chasidic and Orthodox Jewry.When Rabbi Avrum'che used to go out of his house he was alwaysspotless and splendidly dressed. As he walked in the street people bowedtheir heads to him as a sign of honor and respect. This phenomenon wasalso practiced by gentiles as they passed him on the street. They alsoshowed him respect. It seems that his royal appearance and radiant faceand his entire personality contributed to this honorable aura of awe.He loved his children in general and especially his grandchildren.Every Saturday afternoon the grandchildren who lived in Bilke gatheredin his house in order to show their beloved grandfather the knowledgethey had acquired during the week. He listened very intently and derivedgreat nachas (pleasure) from his descendants. I remember when I was aThere Was a Chasid - 703holy soul returned to his maker. He was only sixty nine years old at thetime of this death. As it was customary then, as soon as it was determinedthat Rabbi Abraham died, they removed his body from the bed, placed iton the floor on a simple cloth and covered him with a white sheet. Twocandles in candlesticks burned at his head. His sons, sons in laws,grandsons and many members of the community recited psalmscontinuously in shifts. The "Chevra Kadisha" (the society which deals withthe burial of the departed) took care of the "tahara' (the cleansing of thebody before the burial). The "Lavayah' (funeral) took place in the mainsynagogue since there was not enough room inside the synagogue.Hundreds of mourners gathered in the synagogue yard. Among themwomen, children, men, elderly. Rabbis, judges, Shochatim, scholars andothers from the vicinity, who came to pay their respects to a scholar whowas revered by many. In the eulogies, an account was given of RabbiAvrumche’s wonderful deeds, his great contribution to the communitiesin the area, and about his righteousness, honesty and chasidus (piety).Rachel Yitte, his wife, lived on until close to the holocaust. She diedon the 29th day of Sivan 1940. She was buried in the ohel (mausileum) atthe side of her departed husband Rabbi Abraham (may his righteousmemory be a blessing). She was seventy seven years old at the time ofher death.After the Jews of Bilke were driven from their homes into the ghettoand from there to Aushwitz and other death camps, not one Jewish livingsoul remained there. Following the tragic holocaust, a handful of survivorsreturned to Bilke to search for their dear ones. They left Bilke soon afterin great despair. The last Jew who left Bilke was Joshua Eckstein whobecame stuck in Bilke when the Carpathian Mountains were annexed bythe Russians. He anived in the U.S. a few years ago after many hardships.He revealed that the "Ohel" (mausileum) of Rabbi Abraham And RachelYitte does not exist anymore. It was taken apart by the local population.Wicked people had a hand in it. Mr. Eckstein says that the watchman of704 - The Bilker Memorial Bookthe cemetary in Bilke is watching so that no harm should come to thematzevos (monuments) of Rabbi Abraham and Rachel Yitte (may they restin peace and may the almighty take revenge on the wicked).This is the Last Will - 705This is the Last Willand Testament of Rabbi Abraham Lipschitz, the Son ofRabbi Shabtai LipschitzBaruch Hashem, Tuesday, the portion of the week "Bereshis"" Genesis(Oct. 20,1925, the third day of Cheshvan 5686 of the abbreviated era,my written will here in (the town) of Zavidof, may Zion and its cities berebuilt.Behold, a human being does not know his time, and a man is a man,and with the help of G"d, may he be blessed.

Therefore 1 said (or I decided) that while I still see to write Iwill write a written will in my hand writing and my signature, which willwitness " compared to a hundred legal and credible witnesses.First, I regret and confess all my sins and transgression, that I havetransgressed from my first days until this day, those that are known to meand those that are not known to me, becuase, G"d forbid, not as rebellionThis is the Last Will - 707follow the learning of "Mishnayos "as it says in my precious book (thebook he wrote "Yalkut Avraham".) You should be prudent and study"Mishnayos "every Saturday night ‘ as the holy Sabbath departs, even alittle bit for the ascent of our souls. Each one of you should also donateto charity each day of the first year (after their death) according to hisability, even just a few pennies, and could even give this to "Rabbi MeirBal Hanes fund". At the time that he will donate to charity he should saythe prayer which 1 wrote in my precious book.If G"d will merit me to still be alive to publish my precious book,which is to me more precious than all the world’s desires, 1 would like toask of my beloved sons and my upright sons"in"law, and also of mydelightful and precious grandchildren, that they should try to deliberateand study my book at all times that it will be possible for them, especiallyduring the first year on Saturdays and Holidays, and so forever so thatmy lips shall recite in my grave.As it says in the preface of my book (see there) to transfer the placeof my burial and my place of rest, it would be very pleasant for me to lieat the place of my parents, meaning in Orshava (the town near Bilke whereRabbi Shabsai and his wife are buried) below the chosen place for theesteemed, crown of our head, the master, my father, may he live a longand happy life Amen. Since there is no more room on the side of thisplace because on one side is resting the judge who was there (RabbiShabsai) and on the other side is resting my mother the righteous, mayshe rest in peace, only below the above place immediately under it closeby without any separation.My hope is, G"d blessed be he, that I myself shall buy for myself therein Orshava this holy plot, at this place, and if not, I will request of mysons and my sons"in law may they live long and happily Amen. That theyshould buy a plot for me to fulfill my wish for me to be buried near myparents. Also, my wife, may she live long, also is of this idea, and wouldlike to be placed near me, near by below the grave of my mother and708 - The Bilker Memorial Bookrighteous, may she rest in peace, the honorable wife.For the ascent of our soul, before learning the "Mishnayos" they shouldsay with their mouths, 1 am learning "Mishnayos" for so and so, the sonof so and so, or for her the daughter of so and so " as it says in my bookin the chapter"Vayosef Avraham" letter lamed dalet, and in another placeas I pointed out, because the deceased are mentioned by their father, (seethere) and also after the learning when they will say, 1 beseech you G'dfull of compassion and mercy etc, it should be mentioned the name of thefathers. Also regarding the situation, for many years already we havebrought soil (or dust) from the land of Israel which comes from the soilof Mount Olives in Jerusalem. There is plenty of it in one "kilo" (like twopounds) it should be divided in two halves, one half for me and one halffor my wife, may she live a long life. They should follow the spreadingof this soil as 1 write in my book chapter youd, shin samech gimel, letterkoof heh, see there. Also look at "Orach Chayim" based on the sentence"now this time will my husband be joined unto me." (Genesis 29:34) In thename of our sages, (see there) and also look into the book "Bris Ovos"(this is by Rabbi Shabsai) verse 19, letter nun, see there. It will be verypleasant for us if our beloved children will do and behave as I am doingand behaving during this year after the passing away of my mother therighteous, may she rest in peace. It is already ten months that a candlebums constantly at our house, and because it should not be expensive, Ibought a small lamp which is called night lamp. And so you should do,all my dear and pleasant children and my sons"in"law, the entire yearafter my passing away, because 'The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord"(Proverbs 20:27).

Theywere well to do and respected people. Kalman was given a large sum ofmoney as a bride's wedding gift by Reb Yechiel Hersh. They gave birthto two sons, Mendy and Meir, and three daughters, Sara, Raisy, and Malka.Kalman took over the running of the business from his father RebMoshe Aharon, and Reb Moshe Aharon devoted himself mostly to theestate, the fields, the cattle and chickens etc.When Shmuel David Gelb, the husband of Sarar Feige in "Chust" diedat a young age, and left her a widow with five young children, Reb MosheAharon summoned his three sons, his two daughters and sons"in"law foran urgent meeting in Bilke. He placed the responsibility of supportingSarah Feige and her children on their shoulders. They listened to hisdemand and accepted the responsibility. They had great respect for RebMoshe Aharon and also realized that he was the driving force behind theirsuccess in business.Kalman followed in the footsteps of his father. He took over thebusiness and ran the store. He, too, set aside time for learning Torah. Hewas a member of the Great Synagogue, where he and his father worshippedfor many years near each other. They purchased a number of seats for theentire male family. Golda and Mrs. Leah prayed in the "Ezrath Nashim"" womens' balcony. Kalman was a member of the "Chevra Shas" " thesociety for studying the Talmud. He used to rise early in the morning,enter the "Pulish"" the study hall of the Great Synagogue, take a "Gemarah"from the bookshelves and study "Talmud" until the morning service. Hewas very charitable and a supporter of Jewish scholars. Kalman's name718 - The Bilker Memorial Bookalso is mentioned in the preface to my grandfather’s book "YalkutAvraham", as one of the Bilker donors to the publishing of his book. Healso used to give "Tzedakah” " charity secretly and lend money to theneedy without publicizing it.Kalman had a very pleasant personality. He was an easy going andquiet person who never raised his voice to anyone. One never saw himangry. He conducted his business with ease and relaxation. He was a veryhonorable person and revered by all. His first wife Golda Neuman " mayG“d take revenge for her death " was a modest person and greathomemaker, devoted to her husband, children, and the entire family.When the persecution of the Jews began as the Hungarians occupiedBilke in 1939, the Blassberger family was affected and suffered togetherwith all the Jews in Bilke. The Hungarian authorities enacteddiscriminating laws against the Jews. Among the laws was the decree thatall Jews must cease to conduct business. They were instructed to transfertheir stores to the gentiles, or to the government. The leather goods hadto be delivered to the authorities, since the army needed the material tooutfit the soldiers, as their needs increased due to the war.In 1941, the Hungarians conscripted all Jewish males 18~50 to the”Munko Tabor" " forced labor units. Kalman was conscripted and thefamily " like most other Jewish families" remained without an able bodiedprovider. Reb Moshe Aharon was already eighty years old, but he tried toconduct the activities of the family, taking care of the farm around thehouse and the fields. Kalman was transported with his unit to the Ukrainewhere they did physical work for the Hungarians and the Germans for thewar effort. In the meanwhile, Mrs. Leah Blassberger passed away in 1941.In 1944, the day after Pesach, the Blassberger family, together with theother Jews of Bilke who were still there, were transported to the ghettoof Berehovo.

My name was Mayer Jakubovich, bomin Bilke in 1920, and was named after the Bilker Rabbi, Rabbi Meir Israelswho was the Rav of Bilke before Rabbi Mordechai Liberman. Rabbi MeirIsraels was the Rav in Bilke at the turn of the twentieth century. As theRabbi of the Jewish community, it was his duty to keep the "Metrickel"the records of all the births and deaths of the Jews in Bilke and vicinity.There were some Jews who tried to avoid conscription into theAustro "Hungarian army. It was difficult for Jews to serve in the militarybecause of anti"Semitism and the observance of Jewish customs and lawssuch as the Sabbath.Sometimes Rabbi Israels would change the birthday of the Jewishmales, to make them older or younger to defer their conscription.Sometimes a male certificate was changed to a female in order to avoidthe draft. When the Austro"Hungarian government got wind of it. RabbiIsraels and his helpers burned the records, and he fled to Palestine in 1909.In 1920, Bilke received the news that Rabbi Israels died in Jerusalem.Since I was the first child that was born in Bilke after Rabbi Israels death,my parents decided to name me after him. Reb Yehoshua, the BilkerShochet was my Kwater.I left Bilke in the year 1935, and emigrated to the U.S.A. in 1936. Theeconomy in America was slowly recovering from the 1929 crash. But, itstill was difficult to find jobs, and if one found a job the wages were verylow.

Two of my older sisters emigrated to the U.S.A. in 1920. Someof the others came later illegally. In 1934, my father Moshe Aharon derSchneider (Taylor) passed away in Bilke. He was from Irshava, and haduncles in Bilke. They were Fishel der Schneider, Blasberger and a sisterYente Zisovich.

The Jewish conununityof Bilke was blessed with Torah, Jewish scholarship and enlightenment,fellowship and friendship, and support for the fellow Jew. Although therewere differences of opinion and controversies for the sake of Heaven (andalso not for the sake of Heaven), Jewish Bilke consisted of almost twothousand souls with religious and social institutions which existed foralmost three hundred years. For many generations in our town, Jews werea vital spirit, while the voice of Torah (learning), Tefilah (prayer) echoedthroughout the town.Some fifty years have passed since the eradication of the livingconununity of Bilke, her thousands of families, our parents, brothers andsisters, and our dear ones of our families who were sentenced toannihilation ~ at the hands of the Nazi Beast, the Hungarian Fascists, their728 - The Bilker Memorial Booksatellites and their collaborators " with great sufferings and torture. Thepain is so great that no elapse of time can heal it or cause it to be forgotten.Our community was blessed over the generations with positive typeswho lived their lives according to our ancient Jewish tradition. Not onlythe Rabbi, the Shochet and Chazan (cantor) and the other scholars whoexcelled themselves in the love of the Jewish people and Torah, but alsothe merchants, the ordinary folks, the laborers, the artisans, the poor people,the ordinary multitude did not stray from the Golden Path. The veryholiness that surrounded the Jews of our community added to their strengthand immunity so that they were able to overcome the constant struggleof existence. The holiness was especially felt during holidays, festivalsand special days in the Jewish calendar.When Czechoslovakia was overrun by the Germans " may their namesbe eradicated " the Jews of Bilke were destined to come under the yokeof the Hungarian Fascist Army. Soon after the Hungarian conquest theydecreed harsh ordinances against the Jewish inhabitants.The first victim to fall was Reb Moshe Binyamin Klein, who was shoton the first evening of the occupation while on his way home from theHouse of Prayer and Learning after evening services. That first victimwas an indication of what the Jews of Bilke could expect. The Hungariangovernment, under the reign of Admiral Horthy, instituted racial lawsagainst the Jews of Hungary, among whom were the Jews of Bilke (theseanti"Jewish laws were already in force throughout Nazi"occupied Europe).Every Jew was required to wear a yellow badge, a Jewish Star of David,on their clothing. Jews were forbidden to conduct business; they wereforbidden to practice their professions; their radios were confiscated, andthey were forbidden to leave their homes in the evening. The Jews wereordered to register at the town hall and present documents to prove theircitizenship.Then, in August 1941, came the first wave of deportations from Bilketj i.

Some Jews who hadlived in Bilke for many generations were deported because they did nothave all the documents needed. The Hungarian Gurads marched our fellowJews, men and women, elderly and children, across the border. During thedays they marched them further and further, and during the nights theyconcentrated them in large barns and other structures.The Hungarians knew very well what was in store for the Jews in theUkrainen wilderness. The Hungarian support units, the Ukraine Volunteersand the German Einsatzgruppen (S.S. mobile killing units) perpetrated aterrible slaughter of the Carpathian Jews, among them about one hundredJews from Bilke. The murderers lined up the Jewish families inKamenets"Podolsk and machine'gunned them with brutality.The second great blow fell upon the Jews of Bilke when the Hungariansmobilized all Jewish males, ages eighteen to fifty, into "Munko Tabor","forced labor units". Hundreds of men " fathers, sons, brothers, cousinsand brothers"in"law“ were taken away to forced labor and organized intoarmy'like units under the command of the Hungarian Army. Many ofthese units were sent to the front lines in the Ukraine, Russia, Germany,Italy and Hungary. There, they dug tunnels and trenches, built rail linesand fortifications.Tens of thousands of Jews in the "forced labor units" died from hardlabor, starvation, sickness, frostbite, enemy actions, at the hands of thefanatically anti" Semites. Many sons of Bilke perished. Among them weretwo brothers of this writer: Chaim Aryeh and Nachum Uri " may G"drevenge their deaths. Some of the units remained in Hungary, where theyperformed similar work. They, too, suffered from the brutality of theHungarian officers, and many times were in deadly danger.The non"Jews of Bilke, who for generations had maintained outwardlycordial relations, showed their true faces when they realized that sheddingJewish blood was cheap. Overnight, they changed their attitudes. All along730 - The Bilker Memorial Bookthey had coveted the property of the Jews, their way of life and all thatthe Jews stood for. Many Gentiles helped the Hungarians to execute theanti"Jewish decrees. The leaders of the Jewish community learned of aspecial meeting of Bilke's non'Jewish representatives at which theyapproved the deportation of all Jews of Bilke, because they knew thattheir reward would be great. The old hatred of Jews came now to the forein all its ugliness.Reb Chayim Isaac Rosenbaum, the last president of the Bilker Jewishcommunity, was ordered to present to the authorities a list of all Jewsliving in Bilke. This list served as a guide for the Hungarians in theirsubsequent treatment of the Jews of Bilke. They used it for deportationsto the Ukraine, for the mobilization of males into forced labor units, forall kinds of work the Bilker Jews had to perform for the town; Jewishteenagers were forced to serve in the "levente", the "youth battalions" and,finally, the list served to confirm the final expulsion of the remnant ofBilker Jews, which left Bilke Judenrein " "Free of Jews".On March 18,1944, the Germans took direct power over Hungary withthe help of the Hungarian Fascists, who with great zeal gave "permission"to Adolph Eichman and his hangmen to organize the deportation of theJews from the Carpathian Mountains and other areas. They were deportedinto ghettos first, then a few weeks later to the Valley of Weeping, to thelargest slaughter house in Auschwitz.In spite of the frightening news which did reach the Jews of Bilke, theremnant of Bilker Jews and their families tried to observe the last holidayof Passover according to tradition. On the seventh day of Pesach 1944,the Hungarian authorities informed the Jews of Bilke that on the day afterPassover, they must gather their elders, women and children in the yardof the great synagogue. They were told to bring their allotted baggage,fifty kilograms for each person; all other property they were to leavebehind, all that they had gained over the generations./'/ifv'fi•N.‘4iH> - 'V 'The Jews of Bilke - 731The bad news spread quickly among the Jews; preparations were madeto abandon Bilke. The Jews packed clothing, bedding, durable foods suchas sugar, coffee, hard“boiled eggs, wine for kiddush; leftover "Matzo" fromPassover was broken into small pieces. All of the above was packed intobackpacks, valises and bags. The Hungarian police searched from houseto house to make sure that all Jews had left before they sealed them.The day after Passover, on April 15,1944, the Jews of Bilke assembledwith their baggage and families in the courtyard of their revered greatsynagogue. The police stood there and called out the names of Jews fromtheir lists, family after family. Then, with their guns outstretched, thepolice marched the Jews to the train station. Since most of the males agedeighteen to fifty were already in labor camps, this march was difficult andtook a long time. Each carried his or her own packages, and one tried tohelp another in this march. The Gentiles stood at the sides of the roadleading to the train station and showed their great satisfaction with theexpulsion of the Jews. One could see the great sorrow and pain in the eyesof the marching Jews, their grave worry about the destination awaitingthem on their way into the unknown.After a march of about two hours, they reached the train station whereboxcars awaited them. They were loaded, some eighty to a hundred soulsto a boxcar, along with their belongings. The Hungarian police and theirlocal helpers, the Ruthenians, pushed the Jews into the boxcars and urgedthem to hurry, because they wanted to get rid of this human cargo as fastas possible.The deportation of Jews from the Carpathian Mountains served as anexperiment for handling the rest of Hungarian Jewry. There theyestablished the first ghettos and from there the first transports were sentto Auschwitz. In order to prevent panic and alarm throughout the rest ofHungary, a rumor was spread among the Jews that they were beingrepatriated to safe zones due to the closeness of the Russian front (theRussians were just across the border).732 - The Bilker Memorial BookThree transports of trains carried Bilker Jews to the Berehovo ghetto,about forty miles away. The Hungarians used this ghetto to concentrateJews from the entire vicinity. Some fifteen thousand Jews were pressedinto a very small area, into a brick factory. The area was sealed off withbarbed wire and Hungarian guards. This factory, which had been used tostore bricks, consisted of nothing more than a roof with poles at the cornersand a few supporting columns. It had no walls, no doors, no windows; itwas exposed to the elements, to the cold, wind and rain. Into such astructure the Jews of Bilke were placed. Each shed held many families;each family was designated a small area according to the number of itsmembers. People were lined up on both sides of the barracks.The first thing each family did was to roam the ghetto and bring bricksto make a kind of wall around the sides of the shed to protect themselvesform the elements. Inside, they divided their area from their neighbors byhanging blankets over ropes to provide as much privacy as possible. Theyspread their bedding on the floor before going to sleep. The members ofeach family slept close together because the room allotted to each wasvery limited.In the ghetto, the Bilker Jews made efforts to organize themselves andto conduct their lives in this new situation. Services were held three timesa day inside their structure at the area of the Rabbi, Naftali Zvi Weiss andthe Shochet, Reb Yehosua Doft. each family had to improvise its ownmeals. They tried to preserve as much as possible of the food productsthey brought with them, not knowing how long this would last.Outside the structures, in the field, the men put together a few stonesand bricks and made a makeshift cooking place. They gathered branchesand pieces of wood to make a fire for cooking. Each woman tried toimprovise and show her expertise in cooking. Once a day, the ghettomanagement provided soup, but many did not eat it since there was aquestion whether it was kosher. Only the small portions of bread whichwas provided was eaten. My mother. Pearl Doft, used to make all kindsThe Jews of Bilke - 733of goodies from the matza pieces we brought with us from home, whichlasted for a few weeks.The men were ordered to shave their beards and peiot. Only RabbiNaftali Zvi Weiss and Reb Yehoshua Doft of Bilke did not shave theirbeards. They wrapped their beards with kerchiefs in order to hide themfrom the enemy.A handful of Jews from Bilke who lived in one of the suburbs nearthe forest made an attempt to hide in a cave. After a few weeks theysurrendered to the police, and they were shipped into the ghetto. Also, ahandful of elderly and critically ill, as well as one woman who was aboutto give birth any moment remained for a short while in Bilke. Even thesewere finally brought into the ghetto.The last one to be shipped to Ghetto Berehovo was the pharmacist,who was not known to be Jewish since he never had social or religiouscontact with the Jewish community. It seems that the Hungariansdiscovered this real identity, that he was also a Jew.Also Miriam, the daughter of Isaac Hersh, the milk“man, who yearsago had married a non"Jew, was shipped to the ghetto with her three boys.As she entered the ghetto, the Jews of Bilke did not believe their eyeswhen they saw them escorted by the Hungarian police. Being married toa Gentile did not help her. She told the Bilker Jews that her husband didnot try to save them. It was said that her husband was actually very pleasedto get rid of her, since he had enough of the Jews.One Jewish woman from Bilke lost her mind. She was running aroundin the ghetto yelling, "Save yourselves! Escape! Leave this place". Somepeople thought that maybe she was not mad after all. Perhaps she sawwhat was going to happen. A number of very sick people were taken fromthe ghetto to the town's hospital. Among them was my sister Leah’s smallboy, Eliezer. Just a day before the deportation from Berehovo toAuschwitz, all the sick were returned to the ghetto.Hygie' peoplewers.

He wasstationed with his labor unit in Budapest. The Hungarian Army allowedhim to visit his family in the ghetto. He claimed that his mother, Rachel,was very sick. Our townspeople did not know what to do with him. Theywelcomed him with great love and affection. He was looked upon as ifhe came from a different world. He was asked all kinds of questions, asif he had the answers. Many wanted to know if he had seen any of theirloved ones. Each bit of good news and good rumor brought hope and lifefor the poor people in the ghetto.The Jews of Bilke and the rest of the Jews of Ghetto Berehovo didnot read the writing on the wall. They swung from fear of death to thehope of life; they were in the midst of a desperate struggle underimpossible conditions, on a personal and community level. They copedby trying to put out of their minds the worst that might happen. Underthe circumstances, the Jewish individual was alone, abandoned andexposed to the cruel enemy. This situation was one of the main reasonsand causes that assisted the murderers of the Jew, the Hungarian, theGermans and their collaborators in their work of the destruction of theJews. The Jews did everything in order to delay their end, except uprisingand rebellion.The Jews of Bilke, as the rest of European Jewry, did not believe thetragic news “ just like Job, which came from various sources. Whoeverrelated the horrors was shouted down, that he was spreading fear anddespair, that he sees only darkness, because it was irrational, because what736 - The Bilker Memorial Bookhuman being would take thousands of innocent women, children and menand kill them, make them disappear from this world!

However, in spiteof all the rumors, and all the terrible things they saw, there was no cryingand no panic.At the beginning of the Hebrew month of Sivan 5704 (1944), in themidst of the three days of the eve of the holiday of Shavuot, a rumor wasspread in the ghetto that the Jews of Bilke, and then the rest of the ghettoJews would be moved to a more secure place, because the Soviet Armywas advancing and was very near the area. Some Jews believed this storyand thought that redemption was very near. However, there were otherswho knew that the fate of the Jews had been tragically decided. The nextday, the Hungarians began to load the Bilker Jews into boxcars for theirtrip to the unknown " on their way to Auschwitz.On May 15,1944, a freight train, consisting of fortyfive boxcars, inthem crowded some three thousand Jewish souls, left the brick factorycompound in Berehovo. The entire Holy Community of the Bilker Jewswho were still alive were in this transport. In each boxcar, the Hungariansloaded eighty to a hundred souls with their few things, to which they stillclung. Hungarian police and military guarded the "important’ train andaccompanied it to the railraod station at Koshice, Slovakia, where it wastransferred to the S.S. henchmen, the Nazi units who were known for theircruelty. The train stopped at a number of stations, and after a few days itstopped at the huge railroad station at Krakow, Poland.In the boxcar where I and my family were located, there were a fewother families from Bilke. Many of them were thinking aloud, expressingtheir fears of what one could expect outside the boxcars. My father" mayG"d revenge his death, confessed before our family and before ourtownspeople by saying the following, "I had eleven children; one of themwas smart or wise, who foresaw what will happen". He referred to ourbrother, Shemuel Tzvi, may he be for a blessing, who was the scout pioneer:■ 'v •- ; . .V*/* Vf ■/ / •mi, A... //vr •. ' . ,y><y ■■ 'The Jews of Bilke - 737of Jewish youth in Bilke. He made aliyah to Israel in 1937, in retrospect,they were proud of him.From Krakow, the train continued to Auschwitz, the largest and mostsophisticated slaughterhouse of the Germans for all Europe. In Auschwitz,the doors of the boxcars suddenly opened, with screams, beatings, pushingand shoving by the S.S., who spoke a strange language which most of uscould not understand, all of us were forced to disembark.Tired, broken up, weak and frightened, we arrived at a ramp where thedemon Mengele stood and conducted the selection. He forcefully separatedthe dear and loved ones. The women, children and elderly, " the martyrs” he sent directly into the gas chambers, into the kingdom of death. Thosewho appeared to Mengele as young and able'bodied to work were directedto the other side, into the camp. The fate of the Jews of Bilke was decidedby the movement or signal of the oppressor Mengele's hand.When I stood before him, I saw that he hesitated for a moment whereto send me. Suddenly, he gave a signal for me to go to the right, togetherwith my dear brother, Joseph " may G"d revenge his death. This was thelast time I saw my father, mother, my sister Leah and her five smallchildren, and my sister Sarah, with her small daughter, and the other Jewsof Bilke with whom I lived all my life. At that time, I did not know thatmy three other sisters went to forced labor.In the great confusion as we disembarked from the boxcars, we sawall kinds of people around us " military men in grey S.S. uniforms, guardsin black uniforms, these were the units of various European nationalitieswho volunteered to take part in the annihilation effort against EuropeanJewry, their soul enemies. Also, Jewish prisoners from Auschwitz andnon"Jews in a peculiar uniform, like a shirt of many colors, were alsothere. Their job was to gather together the valises and all the items theJews abandoned in the boxcars and on the ramps by the order of the S.S.and load them on wagons and trucks for assortment.738 - The Bilker Memorial BookThose of us who were chosen for forced labor, to slavery, were directedinto a huge barrack for disinfection. First, they shaved the hair off ourentire body, and then we were forced to immerse ouselves in some kindof disinfectant which had a horrible odor. They provided us with stripedprisoners clothers, with wooden shoes, something like wooden slippers.We, some few hundred people, were then pushed into a barrack whichhad ■ inside on both sides " compartments built of wood. These shelveswere a few stories high; these were the so "called beds on which eightpeople had to lie.Each compartment was so narrow that if one wanted to turn, the wholegroup had to get up; otherwise it was impossible to turn. This problem,of course, caused much friction. These beds gave the prisoners a bit ofrest, but not any relaxation. The people, what was left of them from duringthe day, were actually only stored for the night in these compartments.In the barrack where my brother Joseph " may G"d revenge his death" and 1 were placed, there were only a handful of Jews from Bilke. In thegreat confusion, those of the Bilke Jews were directed to go to slave labor,they were dispersed in various barracks.A typical routine of the day was as follows. We were awakened at 5:00a.m. with screams and whistles and beatings. We had to run to the so'calledlatrines, washrooms. Each morning this huge crowd ran at once into thewashrooms, and it was impossible for anyone to get near a faucet or water.A half'hour later, we had the morning apel, the lineup. Each barracklined up five people across in front of the barrack in long lines. We weretold that the tall people should stand in the back row and the short peoplein front of them. This lineup made it easier for the Germans to see eachface. These lineups were mostly a time of torture for us. Not only did wehave to stand in the rain, cold, snow and wind, but it served for all kindsof cruel punishments.The Jews of Bilke - 739The block eltser, the barracks commaner (a non"jew and also aprisoner) and the kapos (guards, also non'Jews and Jewish prisoners whoturned against their own) stood in front of these units. They counted andrecounted the prisoners to be sure that all were present. When the S.S.entourage arrived with the camp commander, the lager eltser, the prisonercommander jumped to attention and roared the command, "Attention!" Allthe units jumped to attention. Nobody dared to move becasue we knewwhat would happen to us if we did. The prisoner camp commander,reported to the S.S. officer a detailed report of how many prisoners werepresent, how many were in the infirmaries, how many at work, and at theend, how many died during the night. The the S.S. officer walked aroundthe rows and checked and counted.After the role call, "breakfast" was served, which consisted of one smallbowl with black coffee for every five people. There were always frictionsand fights. The one who drank first was always asked not to drink toomuch so that something would be left for the other. The last of the fivewas sometimes left with nothing, because his other four inmates finishedit all.Then all the units marched to their designated jobs. Each prisoner hadto work; whoever was ill, his fate was sealed, and he was selected to die.At noon, we stopped working for about half an hour. They brought thefood, which consisted of soup, to the place where we worked. Each personlined up in front of a huge kettle, and was given a small bowl of soup.This soup mostly consisted of some colored water. If you were lucky, youwould find in your soup a piece of carrot or cauliflower, which was likea treasure.After this break, we returned to our slavery. At night, we returned tothe camp. The guards were German, Ukrainian, Latvian, Croat, Muslimsfrom Yugoslavia and other nationalities who volunteered for this. Theymarched alongside us with their guns drawn. If anyone took just one stepout of line, he was shot on the spot.740 - The Bilker Memorial BookAt the camp entrance we had the evening roll call, the same as in themorning; we were counted and the S.S.officer came, checked it out and areport was given to him of the status of the unit.Then we were released into the barracks where we received a slice ofbread, jam, margarine and coffee. After a day’s or night's work (becausewe worked in twelve hour shifts, one week days, one week nights) of slavelabor, and after great stress and tension, we fell on our triple’deckers,where we were crammed in. At 10:00 p.m., the sirens were sounded tosignal for everyone to be in his barrack. Twenty minutes later, the lightswent out. Anyone who stepped out after curfew was machine"gunned bythe tower guards, without any warning.My brother Joseph " may G"d revenge his death " and 1 weretransported with a handful of Bilker Jews (among them were MendyMechlowitz and Yantzu Ekstein) from Auschwitz to the concentrationcamp Plashov near Krakow.There we worked at all kinds of slave labor, mostly loading andunloading war supplies at the Krakow railraod station.After a few months, 1 was suddenly taken from Plashov and shippedto various camps. Thus, did 1 lose contact with my brother Joseph “ mayhe be for a blessing to all of us " and with him the other Bilker Jews.Alone, without family or landsleit, 1 was transported from one harshconcentration camp to another, seven altogether, until I reachedBuchenwald. There 1 was placed in the the children's barrack, where 1 wasliberated by the glorious U.S. Army in a state of utter despair, weak, sickand barely alive.1 describe here only a trifle about the holy martyrs of Bilke. The deadand beloved souls who were cut down during their young and early yearsof their lives. Until this day 1 cannot divert my attention and mind frommy dear family, all the holy Jewish martyrs of our town, Bilke, and allthe Jewish martyrs who in their lives and deaths did not part.The Jews of Bilke - 741npV^n': '\y '\ V.

To no avail were the survivors waiting, thatthe free and so called enlightened world will punish the murderers andwar criminals. The non"Jewish world quickly forgot about the greatestJewish tragedy. But this is not enough, since many today are denying thatthere was a Holocaust, and that 6,000,000 Jews were murdered.One may ask the question, is there at all an appropriate punishmentfor the crimes perpetrated against the Jews by the Germans, the Hungariansand all the other collaborators, wherever they are? Even the devil has notyet invented a proper punishment for the horror and crimes the Germanand Hungarian Beasts perpetrated against the Jewsih people.Peace and tranquility cannot exist in the world as long as the Gentileworld will not confess publicly to the sins and crimes they have committedagainst the Jews. Otherwise, it appears as if the victims died twice “ oncewhen they were murdered, and again when the criminals deny their deathsaltogether. The nations of the world are to ask forgiveness of the Jewsihpeople in general, and in particular of the State of Israel, the embodimentof the Jewish people. Only then may the blood of our brethren cease tocry out to Heaven: Why? Why?Bilke, My Little Hometown - 743Bilke, My Little HometownBy Raizy Moskowitz Doft-UpschitzThere is a well “known Jewish proverb, "The apple doesn't fall far fromthe tree". But when there is a storm, the apple could be carried away, very,very far.Hitler's brutal storm carried and scattered us from our little town Bilketo all corners of the globe.When I mention this word "Bilke", it"s like I would touch a very soft,delicate spot" it hurts. It hurts very much. In that word is hidden a fountainof remembrances. There we were surrounded by so much love fromparents, grandparents, siblings, friends, neighbors, and landsleit. We hadan identity " we were somebody.The very air was pure, clear, unpolluted, everything natural, nothingartificial. No evil deed, not even evil thought entered our minds. Everyday was a preparation for the holy Shabbos, and every week was anexpectation of the upcoming Yom“Tov. Shabbos was a great spiritualenjoyment. Yom“Tov was a festival.Until the storm.The Brutal, barbaric hurricane, which turned over our entire lives.Suddenly we became cattle“wagon passengers. Lost our dearest, lostour belief in humanity, lost our identity. We had to start from scratch.I found (G"d be blessed), a wonderful life companion “ my husband.We built up a unique family.But the past is haunting. The sound of the word "Bilke", even after744 - The Bilker Memorial Bookfifty "two years, awakens in me an ocean of emotions. Sometimes it gripsme in the middle of a Simcha, like a seizure. How can 1 laugh? How can1 have a good time? How can 1 forget what happened to us? Or, if 1 amaggravated about a minor thing, did 1 lose my senses? How could thisbother me when my brothers perished in such a dreadful way? And a deeppang pierces my heart.Many a night when the mercy of sleep eludes me, 1 shed hot tears,only my pillow could be my witness.Bilke, my home, my partents, my sisters, my brothers, nothing will everreplace you and never, ever will I forget you.■■ 1^'', s'-.•>> ""i-i •J iLs'lrw-K-x.

Howcan a human mind perceive the possibility of such an occurrence?Very simple. He used the right method; a very powerfrul, effectivetool “ namely anti'Semitism. Who, which nation or individual was notready and willing to give a helping hand to destroy a Jew? Especially whenthe reward was so promising ~ to inherit all the properties and belongingsof the Jews.So it amounted to that unfortunate number, six million Jews. To thisnumber people already react with lame, numb feelings. It has become acliche. It doesn’t awaken any compassion any more. Yet these millionsconsisted of single individuals. Each victim who survived could write abook about what he or she went through and how miraculous was theirsurvival.I wouldn’t like to go into all the details. I would just like to mentionwhom I lost.My noble, holy parents, ~ may they be of blessed memory - and mymarried sisters; Leah, with five sweet, smart children; Sarah, with oneblond gorgeous little girl. One wave of Mengel’s hand sent them to thegas chambers.My oldest brother, Chaim Leib, the most devoted son to my parentsand very dear to all of us. He was first taken to forced labor with inhumane746 - The Bilker Memorial Bookconditions. He became sick with typhoid and was put in a stable togetherwith 800 young men. That stable that was called "hospital" was set on fireand the patients were burned alive.My brother Nachum Uri was first taken to forced labor and thencaptured by the Russians. He died of a stomach ailment, since in thebeginning he did not accept the non“kosher food. By the time he realizedthat is was a matter of "Pikuach Nefesh", a matter of endangering alife, itwas too late and he died at the age of twenty four.Allow me to say a little bit more about this brother. Nachum Uri wasa genius. Very handsome, a beautiful physique. He spoke five languages.He was always the first in his class in all subjects. He was exceptionallythorough in the Talmud. 1 am quoting a man, (a real Talmid Chacham)who said, "when 1 hear Nachum Uri learn a piece of Gemarah, 1 can lickmy fingers from it". He never stood idle for a moment. He especiallyenjoyed studying the many works of the Rambam. When he noticed abeggar approaching our house, he ran out to meet him with a generousdonation.Yet, with all these ma'alos he was the greatest "Anav", such a modestboy.When a Bilker man (Shlomo Dovidowitz) saw him lying dead in Russiaon the ground in front of a gate, he said, "This scene is testimony to thetragedy of the Jewish nation".My younger brother Yossi, a very handsome, innocent seventeen yearold boy lived through the honors of the war almost to the end. Peoplehad seen him swollen from hunger enter a hospital. He has never beenseen or heard from since.But G"d didn’t take away everything from us. From eleven siblings,five of us remained alive; three sisters and two brothers. After a lot ofwandering we came to the United States.

Bitzi submitted the following testimony regarding life in Bilkeand the events of 1944:You hear a lot about the Nazi Holocaust: Books are written, films aremade, Rabbis sermonize. I wonder what impact it makes on the fortunateones who were spared that tragedy?To me, it was the end of a happy youth in a quiet, peaceful small townnamed Bilke, which is in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe.My ancestors lived there for many generations. We were a devoted familyof eight. Our town was more like one large family " you knew everybody.From 1938, a cloud of fear was hanging over our peole. We lived inhope and prayed not to fall victim to the dreadful Nazi Holocaust. In thespring of 1944, my dearly beloved family was among the six million Jewsmartyred in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and the other death camps.It all started in 1944, before Passover. Orders were to wear a yellowstar. They did not permit us to leave town. We did not give up hope untilthe last minute. The last day of Passover, rumors circulated that we wouldbe placed in ghettos. Early the next morning came a knock on the doorwith orders to leave. They permitted us to take fifty kilos of food andbelongings. Our beloved synagogue was the gathering place for thetransportation to the ghetto at Beregszasz. I will never forget my dearlybeloved mother's frightened, worried face. The feeling to leave my homeroots " the house that my dearly beloved parents had built with hard work,where I grew up " was fearful.

Transports started; this was the end oftogetherness with our good, devoted neighbors and friends. The Nazisshipped us off in cattle cars to an unknown destination, which was formost of them the last, where they perished sanctifying G“d's name.Here I am, a survivor of the Holocaust, a witness to the war crimesand insanity that grew from anti"Semitism. It is our obligation to urgethat all constituent organizations and the Jewish community set aside thedate and participate in the observance dedicated to the sacred memory ofthe six million "Kedoshim".Remembrances of a Survivor - 753Remembrances of a SurvivorBy: Dr. Moshe Avital Doft-LipschitzSuddenly S.S. men surrounded our barrack and started to push us outof the bunk by screaming, hitting, kicking and clubbing. The Czechsupervisor marched in front of us. He did not want to abandon his childrenat this critical moment. The S.S. guards lined the path from the doors ofthe children’s barrack all the way to the gate of the camp. We had to marchbetween these lines so that we would not be able to escape back into thebarracks and hide. Each Nazi guard held in one hand a gun and in theother a club. When we passed between these devils there was a deadlyfeeling, we felt that this was the end. I was very weak and each steprequired tremendous effort. I prayed silently and wondered from whenceshall my help come. I was thinking in my mind and heart and asking:"Father in heaven, why did these young children deserve such a horriblefate?"As we came closer to the camp gates we heard the shooting, louderand clearer, and one could hear that these were machine guns. Just as wewere about to go past the gate, the alarm system went off and the Germanguards began to run for cover. We were left standing on the inside of thefence near the closed gates.Out of the blue sky there appeared bombers which strafed the Nazimilitary barracks. A number of bombs also fell inside the inmates' camp.At that moment we started to run back into the barracks of the inmates.The bombing continued all day and through the night. With the help offriends I made my way back to a barrack and laid on the ground all duringthe bombing.754 - The Bilker Memorial BookAs the morning arrived there was complete silence, a deadly silence.No more shooting, no guards around, not a living soul was seen outside.Suddenly we saw some prisoners running outside with guns in their hands.The S.S. guards were abandoning their posts, jumping off the towers anddisappearing into the forest. A few minutes later some inmates raised awhite flag. This happened so fast that nobody could believe their eyes. Itwas unbelievable that the super race was defeated and was now on therun.A few hours later, Gerneral George Patton with his Third Army TankCorps entered and liberated Buchenwald. Those of us who could walkwent out to greet the liberators. Almost all were hysterical with joy. I wasin bad shape, I could not stand on my feet and had no strength to celebrate.I prayed in my heart that G'd should give me strength to overcome myweak condition especially at this moment of liberation. I reminded myselfof Samson’s prayer and I whispered it: "0 Lord G"d’ remember me I prayThee, and strengthen me only this once".As the American soldiers entered the barracks, you could see in theirfaces the shock at the unbelievable condition of the prisoners. They foundskeletons of human beings who were dying. During the entire war theyhad not witnessed such a ghastly scene. Although they did experience thedeath of their comrades and of the enemy, they had never seen atrocitiesof such magnitude.The final liberation of Buchenwald took place on April 12,1945, theday President Roosevelt died. We were informed by the American soldiersthat in the forest, thousands of prisoners lay dead, those who were shotduring the last few days before the liberation. These were the vicims ofthe last evacuation. It was estimated that sixty thousand people were killed.Only twenty thousand inmates were alive in Buchenwald on the day ofliberation.We were also informed by the Americans that on the way toRemembrances of a Survivor - 755' ‘f 5‘ ^ ■ J ( i :> : s •,-i ' . . .-"v: . v- r= vj• j : . • f {%C• ■'/ \v*'—; v*.!"' ^ ^ '< V .. , \\ :y~ ■■ v i':■ V\'.V'.. i.- •> i..-W'- , \ \ -^^ ■•A'• •»>A > " • ' AX 'S^W- - ■ • '^t • V^ -  V . • I aC". a' !; •'•••<'"- ■■j^y'v- jf’ i :»’'^i.', /.■' y'vf*', w .: ^ •Buchenwald they captured a train with thousands of "Hitler Youth." Theyhad instructions to take over the remainder of the prisoners in order torelieve the S.S. men for front duties and annihilate the rest of the prisoners.We were very lucky that the Americans blocked their way and thus wewere saved.After the liberation, a number of military doctors and nurses arrivedin Buchenwald to look after the liberated prisoners. We looked upon thesepeople as if they came from another planet. Could you imagine, after yearsof horror, there is suddenly humane care and interest? We were given food,clothing, cigarettes, candy and many other goodies. The American soldiersdid not know what to do with us.They made a terrible mistake by giving very rich food to such verysick people who had not tasted this kind of food for such a long time.Instead of feeding us bland to rich food gradually, they unintentionallycaused many deaths due to the rich diet. Thousands of people died fromgrabbing whatever food they could find. Their stomachs were notaccustomed to it anymore. What shoud have been done was to take all ofus to hospitals, examine everyone and treat us according to the diagnosis.THE INNOCENT VICTIMSMany thoughts entered my mind, one reminded me of the innocentvictims of my family, of all the Jewish people and for that matter all thedecent human beings who were murdered by the enemy. A voice wascommanding me: "Take retribution for the blood of thy family, for thebabies and the children, the pure and innocent who were destroyed beforethey had a chance to live; take retribution for all the victims of allgenerations of this long and bitter exile." More than once it semed to methat I heard the voices of my family which brought me to the breakingpoint.Another thought which occurred to me at that moment was that thereLnapiams, immediately alter tne iioeration ot tsucnenwaid. in me militarycode there were no specific orders on how to handle the survivors.However, the Jewish chaplains had a wonderful guide for such anunprepared situation. This was the Bible. I remember Rabbi Marcus andRabbi Herschel Schachter and their tremendous efforts to help us and thewonderful comfort they gave us. There were times when they had a conflictmRemembrances of a Survivor - 757between their army duties and the need of the survivors, but their Jewishhearts overcame many obstacles.There were a number of mines around Buchenwald where the Germanshad employed the prisoners. After the liberation the Allies found thesemines full of Jewish silver ornaments which the Germans robbed fromthe Jews fo Europe, such as: Torah crowns, Torah breast plates, pointers,kiddush cups, spice"boxes, menorahs, candlesticks, estrogim boxes,Chanukah candelabras. Sabbath knives, eternal light lamps and many otherholy objects. For days and days, military trucks carried away all thoseprecious Jewish ornaments. Who knows who became rich from the Jewishvictim’s property.Those of us who did not die shortly after the liberation, gatheredstrength little by little, but with this their tragedy did not come to an end.The tragedy only deepened because only then did they realize how greattheir losses were. There was also a tremendous feeling of guilt. How is itthat I am the one who survived? Am I more worthy to live than our dearones who were annihilated?n?np? |1"i5T "isd - 76oaughter Selma, their son Samuel, and their daughter Etu.Childhood And Holocaust Memories - 761-.VY- ' '■ .■■' C-iJr-srSr Y \ ‘■ •■ ■, •'.

DearMama, her religious faith, the support of her children both at home andfrom America sustained her. How she waited for "this brievele derMammen" and the financial help from her children. Leib, Victor, and Selmawere lucky to have left home, before it was too late, to the U.S.A.Mother was an example for us, even from the little we had, she wouldinsist on sharing with those less fortunate. We did not think it could getworse, but it did.In April 1944 we were forcibly removed from our home; gathered inour shul, synagogue, searched and stripped of any valuables and marchedto the train and on to Ghetto Beregszaz. While the train passed thecemetery, I prayed for father to intercede with G-d for our safety, andthought he escaped this humiliating and dehumanizing treatment, and isresting in a Jewish cemetery. The world has truly gone mad.After a few weeks we were herded on to cattle cars for theindescribably agonizing trip to Auschwitz.Upon arrival, my mother, grandmother Rifka, Nat’s wife Malka, theirbeautiful children Sara and Tili and Sam’s family - wife Gitel and MosheBenjamin, the child named after our father, and baby Hershel were sentto the crematoria.Toby and I were told by a man in a striped uniform to stay together;he sent us to a line of able bodied young women, and thus saved our lives.After about six weeks in Auschwitz we were sent to Gelsenkirchen,where we would be cleaning bombed sites. When the air raids soundedeveryone was running to underground shelters. The Jewish girls were notallowed in. We ran into the fields and were fire bombed by the Alliedforces. As many as SOO girls were killed; the unrecognizable bodies, limbs762 - The Bilker Memorial Bookand hands, were collected by the surviving inmates, set in a pile and burned.Later we worked in a munitions factory in Sommerda. In spite of threatsto us of severe punishment, we tried to sabotage by making tiny screwsand bolts smaller - our way of getting some revenge.The survival instinct was strong. We fashioned from the wire weworked with, needles, knitting needles, safety pins and such. We knittedfrom yam that we cut and unraveled from woolen stockings, caps for ourshaved heads and mittens to keep somewhat warm. The overseers (German)would comment that they knew Jews were "dirty pigs", why then did weline up at 4 A.M. before work in ice cold water. We even ironed ourwashed dress by moving it back and forth around the one pot boiled stoveavailable.By the spring of 1945, we heard mmors that the war might soon beover. 1 used to dream that my American brothers (Leon and Victor) mightparachute in to rescue us.My main incentive to live was my silent vow to my mother that 1would take care of my little sister Toby, who is till this day my dearestfriend.They made us march under guard to avoid capture by the approachingRussian Army. We’d be herded like animals to spend a night in a pig sty;we had to crawl on our stomachs to get in. I became sick with dysenteryand felt 1 was too weak to continue. When we rested one night in a hayloft, Toby and I dug in deep into the hay and stayed there for two days.Miracle of Miracles! We heard voices in Slovac. In desperation we cameout and begged them not to report our whereabouts.The Germans retreated, we ventured out and because we were not farfrom the Czech border, we left in that direction. We kissed the groundafter a Czech border guard gave us directions to the nearest village. InMonetin, a small village, a Czech family took us in and nursed us backto health.Childhood And Holocaust Memories763We were eager to move on and left the Czech capital-Praha. With helpof the Jewish Relief Agency and the Red Cross we learned that Natsurvived Dachau and Sam survived in Budapest. My brothers and sisterin the U.S.A. shared with us in rejoicing that we survived, but our joy wasmarred by the knowledge that our mother and so many of the familyperished in the tragedy of the Holocaust.We will always remember our fathers saying: "Change things that arebad if you can, but learn to accept things that cannot be changed”.A formidable task. Yet with the help of our husbands. Bill also asurvivor and Michael - Toby’s husband, we remember our familieslovingly and teach our children of the righteous ways of our dear lovedones. May they rest in peace, but in our hearts they will live forever!!Testimony of Moshe Friedman - 765Testimony of MosheFriedmanOne Family's Daring RescueMoshe Friedman is the son of Rabbi Meshulam Friedman, an illustriousBilker cheder instructor. Moshe had already been conscripted into MunkoTabor, the Hungarian forced labor paramilitary in 1941, when his family(who lived in nearby Irshava) were disenfranchised and deported to Poland.The following details emerged from an interview conducted in Germanbetween the author and Moshe Friedman, then translated into English:I was first assigned to Kashau, Slovakia, then later assigned to the areanear Yasin on the border between Carpathia and Poland. All the forcedlabor units were very strict and we served without privileges. I receivedword that all my immediate family " my wife and child, my parents andyounger brothers and sisters, and my brothers and sisters who were alsomarried " had been declared stateless and were being deported formHungary, where we had lived since World War I. Now they were termedstateless, unwanted and former citizens. When the edict was finalized,thousands of Jewish families, men, women and children were "officially”forced to pack their belongings and journey to the Polish side of the borderwhere they were to be resettled.I learned that my own family had been deportred to a Polish town nearYasin, where I worked on the Hungarian side. Then I decided to rescuemy wife and child at all cost. I worked for two labor units, one on eitherside of the border, and began to establish contacts that would enable meto rescue them through bribery.I already had a close friendhsip with the chief officer of our companygementcer of mhe Burgedded that ten I heaiTestimony of Moshe Friedman - 767not arrested.I told my friend Fuchs to follow me for action and we stole two riflesfrom the commando. We arrived at the Burgermeister’s house and toldhim. We were all frightened, with tears in our eyes; we were fearful ofthe consequences. "How can we have a chance to safely survive?" We knewthat we could not make the slightest mistake.We "arrested" our fellow Jews, men, women and children, and"escorted” them under "armed guard". On the way, we encountered aGerman battalion; we informed them that we were escorting theseprisoners to our commandant and they let us pass. All of those we"arrested" were safely hidden in another stable.Almost immediately, we were told that our labor unit was beingtransferred back to Kashau, Slovakia. A new plan had to be made to savethe escapees. We arranged to acquire small amounts of strong whiskyevery morning until we had enough to make the soldiers drunk andharmless. The entire unit became so drunk that we were able to send therescued prisoners on their way to Munkacz, Hungary, where they wouldbe safe.As the Nazi grip tightened, Moshe Friedman escaped to Vienna wherehe remained hidden until the end of the war. His wife and child did notsurvive.In 1941, the Friedman family was disenfranchised. The full story oftheir disenfranchisement and deportation to Kamenec'Podolsk appears inthis book elsewhere. Rivka, a younger Friedman daughter, was sent toSlovakia to live with her oldest sister Ghana and her husband, MosheRosenberg, all of whom were later deported and perished in Auschwitz.Isaac Friedman, a younger son, had bravely made aliyah before thewar began: He arrived just as the ship departed; undaunted, he threw hissuitcase into the boat and swam out to it. Later, from the Holy Land, Isaac768 - The Bilker Memorial Bookattempted bribery and rescue efforts to save his family. Two otherFriedman sons, Chayim Benyamin, a shochet in a nearby town, andAvraham Pinchas were selected for slave labor and sent to Auschwitz;they survived and made aliyah to israel.I:r\ \ ' J i•. tf '•• ■-'Ai ‘-4 livi. -Av :im'v e^SaliAV''. • • A' " .... -. • #• ■• l\'* •V/^:fea®'■ A^v.. ...• ■ \% ' ' >V /.i te«a • .' .' jA ' % . • '< >4 ' ^ ' '\..

My father had the "zchus"to feed hundreds of homeless each "Erev Shabbath". We were very contentwith our lifestyles, until 1939 when the Hungarians took over. Bilke, wherewe were raised as little children, and started our long journey throughdifferent concentration camps.The first step to Judenrein was when the Nazis suspended all Jewishstore owners licenses. In April, 1944, we were told to leave all our treasuredbelongings behind, to feed the greedy Germans! Having no otheralternative we were dragged towards the dreadful Beregsaz ghetto.Early one morning, my father called me over to a comer and told methe following; "Yanky, the years to come will be very difficult. You'll begoing through terrible 'tzoros' and hardships. Please, I beg of you withmercy, always remember 'Hashem'; Strengthen your 'emunah' and'bitachon' and you're sure to survive. I know you will. When I look downat you from '01am H'emes', please make me proud. Just always rememberyou are a Jew and be an 'ehrlicher Yid"’.I was only twelve years old at the time and until my father confrontedme, I never really faced reality. My father's few words suddenly made mefeel so grown up and so alone. Despite my confusion, I promised my fatherthat I'll never forget his words and always be a trae 'Eved Hashem’.n9rrp? isd - 770m•••.■•.■■■«#> OfiJimW'*‘ V •>.

Each day, more Jewswere deported, and supposedly taken to work on a nice farmland. We wereall convinced and couldn’t wait our turn; but somehow something deepinside kept on telling us that things might just be worse. We didn't knowthe Germans dirty tricks yet, unfortunately we quickly learnt about them.After a long train ride we arrived in Auschwitz and were greeted byscary looking SS men. Within minutes the cheerful looking Germanstransformed into mean beasts. It was then that our worst fears turned intoreality."Ladies and children to the right and males to the left!" they bellowed.To ensure that we stay in line, "kapos" were circling between the hundredsof people. One kind "kapo" came over to me and whispered in my ear,"You look like a smart and mature "yid”'. Let me tell you the key tosurvival. I know you are only twelve years old, however you can definitelypass for seventeen. Whenever you are asked to tell your age, always claimto be seventeen. Soon you will be inspected by Mengele. Tell him in aconfident strong voice I am seventeen and I want to work! Listen to me,young man, this is the key to survival".I made sure to remeber his warning. I knew that the "kapo" is definitelysent straight from the 'shomayim' and directed to me because I wasdestined to live.My mother, little sister Perele and I were on the right, clutchingtogether and crying bitterly. My holy father, especially, looked thirty yearsolder than he was, because of the constant flowing of tears. After fourlong hours, we were finally standing in front of the inhumane Mangele. Iwas separated from the rest of my family because I told him I wasseventeen and I want to work. Women, children, and the elderly wereimmediately sent to be exterminated, because the Nazis claimed they’reuseless. The merciless doctor gave me a harsh spanking, and I772 - The Bilker Memorial Bookbrokenheartedly watched as my family cried 'Shema Yisrael' and walkedinto the gas chambers. Then the Nazis grabbed my precious 'Tefillin' andburnt them in front of my eyes. My father gave me this brand new pairso 1 can use it when 1 become 'Barmitzvah'. This only added to my terribledevastation. With all that, somehow, 1 strengthened my "bitachon" andforced myself to go on.I remained in Auschwitz for a few unbearable, bitter weeks, with ashaven head, striped uniform and a number around the neck. The dailymenu consisted of black bread and black coffee for breakfast, a ladle ofunedible sand soup for lunch and for dinner we had some petty leftovers.We were expected to work harder than husky dogs, with no food to sustainus.Our next destination was Plashov near Cracow poland. We stayed therefor months with even less food. Our job was to build foundations forbarracks. The Russians were fast approaching Poland, so extra people werejust a burden to the Poles. We were therfore sent off with approximatelyone pound of bread, per person, to our next unknown destination. We knewit would be a while till we would arrive, but out of sheer hunger wevoraciously devoured our bread. Sure enough, the trip took three tortorous,long days. Most of us had no choice, but to fast. We came off the threeday train ride like stumbling, meatless skeletons.The conditions in Grosse" Rosen only deteriorated, until we were takento Bolkenheim, which was situated upper north. This meant the weatherwas an added hazard.At this point of the war, the Germans began to realize their plan toexterminate Jews was failing because we are to an extent invincible!Therefore, now more than ever, the immoral Nazis looked for best methodsof torture and mass killings. They woke us up the coldest part of the night,made us undress, and as we shivered we were forced to take snow showers.The monsters ranted and raved at our frail goose bumped bodies. ThisA Scroll of Agony and Hope - 773was a nightly occurrence. If by chance someone was caught 'davening' orhandling 'Tefillin', the entire camp was summoned to the gallows to watchthe beating and then the hanging of the afflicted Jew. Many died 'A1Kiddush Hashem'.Thereafter, we went on a hundred mile walk beacuse the Russians wereonce again taking over. Every few days we stopped into a camp, Whoevercouldn't make it was shot dead. We carried a weak, sick friend of ours.The last camp we were in before liberation was Dirno, Czechoslovokia.A far cousin of mine recognized me, and since he was a doctor of thecamp, he arranged that I get a double portion everyday. I constantly feltas if a 'malach' an angel was right above me, watching and giving mestrength and directing me to the right 'Shlichim'. People were dying likeflies. We woke up every morning in Dirno to find lifeless skeletonssurrounding us in our barracks.On May 9th 1945, the Russians came finally to liberate us. My friendsand I went to live temporarily in German deserted houses and we hadplenty of food. Hundreds died because after months of fasting their bodiescouldn’t tolerate food. Miraculously, my body was able to withstand thedrastic changes.I was fourteen years old by then, and I stayed in Budapest for a whilewith my half brothers and sisters. I then went to Gateshead, England tolearn by Rabbi Dessler’s 'talmidim' for five years. In 1951, I came toAmerica, learned in 'Torah v'Daath' and got 'Semicha'. In 1955. onNovember 13,1956,1 got married.The 'Yad Hashem' revealed itself so vividly every minute of the way.It all started when the "kapo" warned me never to tell the Nazis my realage who asked for children to please come with them to a 'chocolatefactory’.They took those poor children to the crematoria! I was only a kid and774 - The Bilker Memorial Booksometimes it sounded so enticing to go, but 'Hashem' gave me 'sechel'(intelligence), and 1 didn't go.Whenever people got sick or were just too weak to continue, they weretaken to the infirmary. In most cases those 'yiden' were never seen again.With all the terrible conditions, somehow I never got sick, nevercomplained and was never taken to the infirmary.In the camps, we wore wooden shoes. Since they weren’t quite my size,1 found rusty metal wires and tied them to my feet so they would stay on.They constantly cut into my sore skin, but wonderously the broken skinnever got infected.I knew my family's tremendous 'Zchus of Tzedaka’ and always picturedthe hundreds of homeless in front of our store. My "Rebbe’s" wordsallways echoed in my mind. (’Tzedaka will save one from death').Way back at the beginning, my father told me, "I know you willsurvive". These words pulled me throught the worst of times, because ofwhat "Chazal" say: "A righteous man decides and G“d fulfills".Over Fifty Years - 775Over Fifty YearsHave Passed since World War II Ended and Hitler's NaziEmpire Collapsed.By: Manny (Mendel Chayim) MechlowitzOver Fifty years have passed since I was liberated by anAfro“American soldier from the atrocities of a succession of fourconcentration camps: Auschwitz, Mathausen, Melk and Ebensee.

Her only child to survive wasMickey. Over Fifty years have past since I lost my oldest brother Danielto the hospital at Melk just weeks prior to liberation.Over Fifty years have past since I was fourteen " my childhood inthe small village of Bilke, Czechoslovakia was brutally yanked away andI was forced to become an adult at the gates of Auschwitz. I could nolonger act like a child. My brother Daniel, whispered to me, "Stand Tall"and I tried. I made it through the selection process. My eldest sister Sarahand her three children did not.Reflecting back upon the year 1944, it is hard to believe that two yearsprior to 1942,1 was living a fairly "normal life" in Bilke, Czechoslovakia,a small peasant village with roughly two hundred Jewish families. Tounderstand the climate of the time, it is important to understand the eventsthat led up to our deportation to the concentration camps. In 1938, theclimate started to change in my small town of Bilke. Czechoslovakia wasnp?’'s n?rTp? "isd - 776In this picture (160) we see Manny Mechlowitz, theson of Noah and Fayge Mechlowitz of Bilke.

In 1939,the Germans marched into Czechoslovakia " dissolving the Czech armyand establishing a puppet Slovakian government. Ruthenia was dividedbetween the Hungarians and the independant Ruthenian Governmentheaded by Volosin. Five months later, after two hours of fierce fighting,the Ruthenian government fell and the Hungarians took over the rest ofRuthenia. Bilke was located in Ruthenia.My family, like all of the families in Bilke, lived without electricityand running water. My parents had ten children, two died from typhoidfever before 1 was even bom. We lived in a three room farmhouse andowned two horses which were used to plow the fields and haul firewoodfrom the forest. These horses were also our only form of transportation.We owned one cow and some chickens which provided us with milk andeggs primarily in the summer months because the winters were too severe.My parents were adamant about educating their children. My day asa ten or eleven year old was probably a bit different from the average tenor eleven year old. From 5:00 " 7:00 a.m. 1 attended Hebrew school. From7:00 ■ 8:00 a.m. 1 went to the synagogue for morning prayers. From 8:00a.m. to 3:00 p.m. I attended regular school, then off to dinner. Typicallydiimer consisted of meatless soup with corn bread.When the Germans attacked Russia, life had changed as 1 had knownit. The Hungarian children were trained in a semi'military school. Thegentile children played soldier with wooden guns, and the Jewish childrenhad to carry shovels.In the early 1940’s, the Jewish men were drafted into labor camps.Many of them were sent to the Russian front where they performed meniallabor such as building roads, airstrips, and burying the dead. Additionally,all of the Jews were ordered to wear the Star of David.In 1941, the Hungarians gave orders for deportation of those Jews whocould not prove their Hungarian citizenship. About twenty families in my778 - The Bilker Memorial Bookvillage were given notice to leave their homes. About 50,000 Jews fromRuthenia were sent to Poland, and we later found out that on August 27thand 28th they were machine gunned to death at Kamenets Podolks.In 1943, my mother died suddenly. My brother“in“law, who lived inParis, became a French prisoner of war. Five months later, my father died.My life basically had turned upside down. 1 did not think it could get anyworse. 1 was wrong. Five months after my father's death, 1 began myjourney to the ghetto.On March 26,1944, we were deported to a town called Berehove, fiftymiles from Bilke. All of the Jews from the region were housed in a brickfactory. Each family made futile attempts to have some privacy by erectingblankets to make cubicles. We lived in the ghetto for four weeks prior tobeing herded into "cattle cars", eighty people to a car. No food or waterwas given to us for days. Each step of the way 1 honestly believed it couldnot get any worse. Of course 1 was very naive. 1 remember very clearlywhen the doors of the "cattle cars" were opened. The SS were screaming,the dogs were barking, people were moving frantically in an attempt toavoid the blows from rifles. 1 was separated from my two older sisters,Roslyn and Helen and my younger nephew, Jacob.Last week 1 visited my sister, Roslyn and Helen. For the first timeRoslyn told me what happened to her during the selection process. Mysister Helen and my nephew Jacob were separated from Roslyn. Roslynwas sent to a labor camp while Helen went with Jacob along with otheryoung children, their mothers, the elderly, and the sick. While Helen waswalking, she turned around frantically searching for Roslyn. However,Roslyn was in the other line that was destined for labor. One of the inmateswho helped direct the traffic told her "1 am not looking, go over to theother side quickly," which she did.My sisters remained in Auschwitz for six months where they weretattooed on their arms “ A6637 and A6638.

Sjtclothes which were left behind on the station platform; not only from thepeople sent to work, but the women, children, elderly, and sickly who weregassed. In Brikanov, there were four crematoriums surrounding the areawhere my sisters worked. They had enough to eat there because they founda lot of food between the clothes. My sister, Roslyn, knew what was goingon in Auschwitz as soon as she stepped out of the railroad box car. Anold"timer who was working at the railroad pointed out to her the smokefrom the chimneys and told her to look up and see where her parents hadgone. Of course she did not believe the woman.Every night they heard people screaming as they were being gassed.Roslyn told me when the smoke started to come out of the chimneys, shewas relieved because the people were no longer suffering.There were times when the crematoriums could not keep up with thegassings so they stacked the bodies outside of the crematoriums. Thestench was overwhelming. The people who worked at the crematoriumswere periodically (every three months) sent to the showers to be gassedto eliminate any future witnesses. Roslyn related to me one incident wherepeople who were working at one crematorium refused to enter the gaschamber. The SS shot them as they were singing the Jewish nationalanthem. Roslyn and Helen never expected to survive. As the Germansevacuated Auschwitz, my sisters were sent to Germany to work at anammunition factory.I was walking with my brother Daniel in columns of five until wereached a group of SS ” one of which was Doctor Mengele. He wasstanding there pointing to us as to where we should go “ to the right orto the left. At that time we did no know that he decided who should begassed and who should be sent to a labor camp.I remained with my brother Daniel. My identity became #68583 andDaniel's became #68584. As #68583,1 have a lot of memories I would liketo share with you which for a long time I tried to forget.Over Fifty Years - 781extremely efficient. We had to carry bricks from the railroad station backto the camp, We found out later that these bricks were used to build acrematorium at Melk.One day, we were ordered to line up outside for hours. We were forcedto watch a Russian prisoner hang for attempting to escape. The guards didnot even have the decency to cover his eyes. To this day, I still rememberthe horror and torment in his eyes.I would do anyhthing for an extra piece of bread or an extra minuteof rest. I used to try to steal an extra few minutes of rest by going to thelatrines. But even the latrines were not sacred. The guards would hitanyone who stayed too long. The only thing to look forward to was thehalf day off we received every two weeks which was spent debusingourselves with stones.In March 1945, Melk was evacuated. We were marched to the Danube,loaded into freighters and transported ot Linz, Austria. After the boat ride,we were marched for days. Those that were too weak to march were shot.We went through a village where I saw a water pump. As I tried to drinka little water, the SS hit me with the butt of his gun. We finally arrivedat another camp called Ebensee and were imprisoned there from April1945 to May 1945.1 looked like one of those skeletons you’ve seen in thepictures. 1 knew my days were numbered, but I continued to fight, tryingto stay alive. 1 ate coal and chewed on tar just to have anytining to eat. Igot very sick from eating the coal. When we arrived at the barracks, peoplewere just laying on the floor waiting to die. I recognized my second cousin,Izchak. He had given up, but I would not let him.I told him that liberation was imminent in just a matter of days. Hestarted to cry and said there was no point. His wife and children werealready dead. But he did fight and he too was a survivor, living to the ageof eighty five in Israel with his second wife and their two children. Hepasssed away about a year ago.782 - The Bilker Memorial BookOn May 6th, 1945 the guards had vanished. Our biggest fears... where1) were the guards? and 2) what would they do to us? We thought we wereall going to be shot to eliminate all witnesses. 1 decided to grab a blanketand go to the railroad station to catch a train to go home. Of course, therailroad station and trains were all bombed. 1 decided to go back to thecamp. On the way back to the camp, 1 stopped at several different homesasking for food. The Austrian citizens were more anxious to give me foodswearing they had no knowledge of the camps. An hour after 1 returnedto the camp, not really sure what to do or where to got, the Americantanks rolled in. The American soldiers were all crying in utter disbeliefas to what they saw. The American soldiers set up a field kitchen and gaveus plenty to eat, not realizing that the skeletons in the camp were physicallyunable to absorb the rich food. Many of us got dysentery including myself,and many others died. The American soldiers proceeded to round up allable bodied men from the local population including the mayor to cleanup and bury the dead.With all of the atrocities that occurred within the time span of lessthan two years, there were a few acts of kindness which for me, 1 believe,made the difference between life and death. An old man would hide apiece of bread under a large rock. 1 would break the bread in half andgive half to my brother as we passed each other on the way to and fromwork, while at Melk. 1 was on the day shift and Daniel was on the nightshift. 1 saw him every day until just weeks before liberation. 1 found outhe went to the hospital " 1 was never to see my brother again.One day the old man stopped leaving bread. To this day 1 wonderedwhat happened to him. 1 can only hope that he was not caught leavingbread because of course that would be punishable by death.There was also a guard who gave me a piece of bread when we passedthrough the dark tunnel on the way to the work site and a French prisonerof war at the camp assigned me to take the soup kettle back to the kitchen.An extra piece of bread here, and an extra piece of bread there, a scrapOver Fifty Years - 783/yUVl\■m.MaaT. <.IW'rfi-KJ :v ^ y5 U<>» * <‘v i*/ v ’'" AVn "♦ ./oi'Jin the soup kettle, I am convinced that is why I survived.Even when the war was over, and the distance from the campsincreased, it was not over. Where should I go, this boy of fifteen? Weremy sisters alive? Of course, I knew that Daniel, Sarah, Reisel, Israel, andJacob were not. Could I perhaps find my sister Margie who my parentsmanaged to get out of Europe to the United States before the devastationstarted? Was my sister Irene alive, who happened to spend eighteen monthsin camp set up by the Vichy government in France? How fortunate it wasmy mother and father died some months before these events began. Theywould not have survived and did not have to witness the agony of theirchildren and families.Now out of the camps, I was determined to find my way home to Bilke.I was deathly ill and still looking like a skeleton. Most of the trains hadbeen bombed. However, the American army provided us with trucks totake us across the border to Czechoslovakia after which I had to fend formyself. 1 wandered aimlessly going from town to town hoping to find mysurviving family. 1 got off one bus in Budapest where I was walking tofind a place for shelter. Somebody yelled behind me ~ "uncle”. I turnedaround and saw my nephew Mickey. Mickey had made it through theselection process by running away from his mother and others going tothe gas chamber, and jumped on a train going to a labor camp. He did notknow what was going on, but his instinct told him to go with the men andstay away from the women and small children. He was thirteen at the time.Mickey told me later he is convinced that part of the reason he survivedafter the war was because, upon liberation, he crawled into a pig sty andfell asleep rather than eating the rich foods that were handed out. Even ifhe had wanted to eat some of the food, there were cans of food beingdropped everywhere and Mickey had never seen a can before so he didnot know how to open it.When I saw Mickey in Budapest, he told me of rumors that his fatherOver Fifty Years - 785along with three others who had joined our group across the border intoRomania. Directly across the border, in a town called Satu"Mare we werecaught by the Romanian police and spent half the day in jail, With thesmall gold rings that the women had, we bribed our way out of jail. Wehopped on a wagon going to the Hungarian border and hired a guide tohelp us cross to the Hungarian side. The guide left us in the middle ofnowhere. We heard dogs barking so we followed the sounds to afarmhouse. One of the girls in our group knocked on the door, waking thefarmer who then pointed us in the right direction telling us that guardswere sleeping in the barn. We retraced our steps and proceeded in theright direction. Finding another farm, we hid in a pig sty while several ofthe girls talked to the farmer. The farmer took us in his house and madeus a fire to warm ourselves. With an apron that my sister Roslyn had, wewere able to barter for the help of his thirteen year old daughter to takeus across the border into Hungary. Upon crossing the border, we waitedfor a train for two days to go to Budapest. We jumped the train along witha lot of others with the same plan. While on the train, my sister Roslynreceived numberous proposals of marriage. The only condition for themarriage was that she leave me behind. You have to understand that peoplehad been devasted by the loss of their loved ones and were desperate forcampanionship. There was no rhyme or reason for some of their behavior.We arrived in Budapest two days later hoping to get the required papersto go to Prague. No more papers were being handed out in Budapest.We hopped on yet another train to cross the Slovakian border. Thetrain we jumped on was a Russian troop train; however, one car was openand empty which allowed many others to travel to Slovakia. In the brokencar were two Russian soldiers who were going for a joy ride. When westopped in the train station, the soldiers got off the train to confiscate abench so the girls could sit. The Slovakian police noticed the soldier’sactions and chased all of us out of the train except the two Russian soldiers.At this point we found a Jewish agency who was helping refugees to move786 - The Bilker Memorial Bookon with their lives by giving them money. We used the money to buypassage to Prague. Upon arrival in Prague, my sister Roslyn took me tothe hospital. 1 am unsure to this date if she took me because 1 was sick or1 needed someplace to stay. Roslyn set out to find my sister Helen, whomshe found. Ironically we ended up crossing the border into Germany. Wethought that because we were in the American zone, there would be noproblem to get to the United States. Instead, we found ourselves in adisplaced persons camp where we stayed for three years.Mickey joined us at the displaced person's camp for a short time.During that period Mickey and 1 decided that we were going to smuggleourselves into France. We had no idea where France was, but we boughta map and started our journey. The reason was to find my sister, Irene,who, after eighteen months in a concentration camp, was in France withher prisoner"of"war husband David, who had also survived. As we set offon our adventure, we ended up smuggling ourselves into the French zoneof Germany. We decided to go to Austria on a boat and it all seemed veryeasy until we were met at the other end by the Austrian police. We werearrested and subsequently bailed out by some local Jewish citizens. Atthis time our little adventure became exhausting, so we decided to join akibbutz which was located in Hohenems, Austria. The people of thekibbutz were preparing themselves to be smuggled into Israel. My sisterspersuaded me to come back to Germany, and Mickey went back toCzechoslovakia. A little later he joined the Haganah and went to Israel tofight in the 1948 war.Finally, in 1948, an executive order by president Harry Truman allowed400’000 refugees to come to America; my sisters and myself were amongthis group. The story doesn't end there. Within one year I was drafted intothe U.S. army during the Korean conflict and sent oversease to a place Ihad left a short time before “ Germany.I have tried to make sense out of my experience. There is none. I amleft with one thought... we must all ensure that atrocities and inhumanityOver Fifty Years - 787of this magnitude must never " ever happen again. The Bosnian/Serbianconflict in my opinion should not have been allowed to have gone on forso long. The Palestinian/lsraeli conflict has dragged on for years. We needto take a pro "active stance and not allow lives to be needlessly sacrificedover land, oil, or political convictions.Two points 1 must try to leave with you. Some may think of theholocaust as something horrible which took place a long time ago " overthere where insane Nazis reigned " and to someone else, someone, moreunfortunate than ourselves. 1 ask you to think of the Holocaust assomething that can happen anywhere. As former NBA President WillardMcGuire said in Jerusalem some years ago, "the memories of the horrorsof the Holocaust must echo through this and coming generation ofAmericans so we shall never forget".Secondly, as I talk to you today, in March 1994, let’s ask ourselveshow much real progress have we made in the past forty'nine years.80,000 Neo"Nazis have surfaced in Germany and G"d only knows howmany more around the world; Kids go to the movie, Schindler's List, andridicule the movie.The conflict between the Jews and Palestinians continues into its 50thyear; and although a treaty with some Arabs has been signed, it will takegeneratons before real peace occurs.Guest speakers in the Cobb County school district in Georgia areteaching that the Holocaust never occurred, people are making a livingtelling that lie in many places around the world.Louis Farrakhan, who is one of the most controversial leaders of theBlack community, refers to Jews a "bloodsuckers", Judaism as a "gutterreligion", Israel as "an outlaw state", and Hitler as a "very great man","wickedly great" he later expalined. According to a poll conducted byTime/CNN, seventy three per cent of those surveyed were familiar withWho Am I? - 789Who Am l!Testimony of Reszi BohmReszi (Rivka Josovic) Bohm is the daughter of Reh M. Josovic, aBilker carpenter. She submitted the following detailed testimony:The Germans occupied Budapest in the middle of May, 1944. Thedestruction of the Jews was imminent. For the past couple of years I hadworked in Weiss Mandel’s Restaurant at Weseleney 18, with Shmilu Braun,Basie Chajemovics (who died in Auschwitz) and a Bilker Gentile girlnamed Ilona Lipcsej. My residence was Weseleney 11.An order was issued stating that Jews were not allowed to employGentiles, so Ilona decided to return to our hometown, Bilke. I begged herto sell me her working book, but she refused and she went home. Myintention was to get Aryan papers and live through the war somehow,somewhere. However, her misfortune was my luck, because she forgot todeclare her departure at the food rationing office.On about May 20th, a proclamation was posted on the wall in theproject at Weseleney 11: Every Jew must register within three days, ofcourse, I didn't want to be among those registered, so in order not to bedeported, I had to do something drastic quickly. I obtained a blankdeclaration, filled it out and forged the housemaster's signature. I took offthe yellow star and went to the police station to register the declaration.The next day, I lied to the housemaster and told him that I received a cardfrom lion Lipcsej that said she had lost her declaration; would he pleasegive her another one because she would not be able to register at home,in Bilke. He gave it to me reluctantly. This was a start at working towardthe false papers. With the declaration in hand, I took off my star again790 - The Bilker Memorial Bookand went to the food rationing office, where I received a rationing book.On Thursday, 1 bought a religious cross with a chain. 1 took off rayyellow star permanently, replaced it with the cross and started job’hunting.1 preferred going to the country where food would be more available and1 would also be safer from the city bombings. In the newspaper, 1 foundan advertisement for a housekeeper in Shiofak. Immediately 1 went for aninterview.The place was in Buda: Freda Leba and Sons bakery, Alkotas 10. Whilethe lady was interviewing me, someone else called on the phone about thejob. 1 was sent away and told to call back in about two hours. Those twohours were endless. In order not to just roam the streets, 1 rode in a trolleycar most of the time. When I came back, 1 was hired. The next day, onFriday, 1 had to take my new position in Shiofak near Lake Balaton.Everyting that I did went on with great secrecy. Somehow, the peoplearound me suspected that 1 would be leaving soon. Sure enough, 1 saidgoodbye to the older Mr. and Mrs. Weiss, Morritz, Surika, Shmilu andBasie. Nobody knew of my destination. The restaurant was still goingfairly strong, but 1 left and went on the Southern Railroad station directlyto Shiofak.My emotions were so mixed. 1 asked myself the same question overand over again: Who am I? Is this real? Will 1 be able to play the role ofa Catholic girl who doesn't know anything about Christianity? Although1 bought a Catholic prayer book, it was still a far cry from the way 1 wasraised in a truly Jewish home where every fiber of my being wasinterwoven with our religious heritage. Will I be able to sustain this? Iprayed to G"d that He should help me and show me the way in this strangeatmosphere.1 arrived in Shiofak in the late afternoon. The two Freda sons owneda villa there. Within the two families there were three children and twonannies. The parents came down only for the weekends. 1 was theirWho Am I? - 791housekeeper. I always had to remember who I was, my exact name,birthday, etc. One day I was called to the city hall; I was terrified. My fearvanished soon when I received a personal identification card, and later awork book. Now I really felt a little more secure with all those papers inmy hands.To church I went only once, because the family wasn’t very religious;to me it was a blessing. My thoughts plagued me with guilt. I wasconstantly thinking about my family and friends whom I had left behind.My only hope was my strong faith and courage to live.Listening secretly to the BBC radio news from London, I gathered thatthe war would end soon. I was determined to struggle through it, whateverthe cost. Heartaches were sometimes unbearable. At bedtime 1 used to lockthe door because I had nightmares. I was afraid that perhaps I would saysomething in Yiddish and, therefore, could betray myself. One had to beextra careful.I kept on working until the end of the season, September 1,1944. Theyall returned to Buda and 1 was left without a job. I rented a room inBudapest on a day~to~day basis. I was living in torture because I wasafraid to go out, and staying in would arouse suspicion. There was stillsome money due to me from preda's I went to collect it, they offered mea job as a sales clerk in the bakery. Of course, I accepted it with pleasure,food and board included. I took to the business as a duck takes to water.One day, a man wearing a yellow arm band came in, supposedly tobuy some bread. Lo and behold, here I saw my friend and schoolmatefrom Bilke Itzik Reisman. When he saw me behind the counter, he sneakedout in order not to betray my Gentile disguise. Later he told me that I hadturned all colors. A policeman, whom I knew from Weiss Mandel'srestaurant, also came into the store once. Quickly I bent down underneaththe counter, pretending to look for something. When he left, I said "Shema"with a sigh of relief. There were numerous crucial incidents like that.x5.:<-S':-»:-:;-*'i*K:::::s;5s#■: ■".'■■■■;■:?;¥:::¥S:*»:<:5¥sIn?9''s n?np9 tinsT nsD - 792Who Am I? - 793My friend, Armin Gelb, also lived on forged papers and called himselfPista; he was under Swiss protection. He came to the bakery once a weekand I gave him about twenty kilos of bread and other food I was able toget; this he smuggled into the ghetto. I was stealing and hiding one or twoloaves of bread every day in order to fill up his rucksack. Bread wasprecious, rationed in very small amounts a day per person. People stoodin line from 4:00 a.m. for their daily rations. I was offered gold and otherarticles for the bread. Later on, the shelling became too dangerous forPista (Armin) to come, so I sent him the bread with a messenger a coupleof times, which he acknowledged when he received it.After Christmas, the Red Army surrounded Budapest and fiercefighting began. The store was under constant shelling. We wore helmetsall the time. My good fortune played an important part in my life. Thecook had a fight with the boss, so she left. The kitchen was in the basement,near the air raid shelter, so I offered my services as the cook, althoughthe work was much harder. I had to cook for twenty people every day,but it was much safer than in the store.On January 22nd, 1945, the Russain planes dropped six bombs on thebakery, and it was destroyed, three dead and three injured. Thank G~d, Iwas unharmed. Four of us girls fled across the street into an air raid shelter.I stayed beehind a little while until I could get enough food from thestorage in order to survive. Life in the shelter was horrible: There was nodrinking water and only one toilet facility for fifty people.The Russians liberated us at about the end of March or the beginningof April. This was another experience in my life. It should have beenhappy, but it certainly was not. The Russians came in very drunk, with alarge German shepherd dog. They had weapons in their hands and theywere shouting lewd things. Inasmuch as I was looking forward to thisliberation day, it was spoiled by their uncivilized actions. When I sawtheir behavior and lust for women, I hid in a coal bin, where I stayed forthree days. Sure enough, women young and old were being raped.to my unclepersonal pape:my Gentile diYork, and seWho Am I? - 795• * * ’* >\ '• vyT• '*■•.UKh' <-. ■'■ \'- V ' . ■ ; ■.\ '■Vi^vi> j:?''• .*>.

Somehow I felt good, thinking to myself about when the day wouldcome for me to sail the ocean and be reunited with my family in America.In Pest, the streets were full of refugees looking for and asking about theirloved ones.Now the time had come to tell my bosses the truth about my identity.When I saw them in the office, 1 went in and started: "Gentlemen, beingthat up until now 1 was unable to keep my religion, and now that Passoveris approaching, I was invited to the Weisses, my friends to celebrate myholiday with them”. They looked at me as if I were crazy."The truth of the matter is this: 1 am no longer Ilona Lipscej. My realname is Reszi Josovic and 1 am Jewish. In order to live, I had to save mylife in this manner. I didn't want to be slaughtered like the rest of myfamily". 1 couldn't hold back the tears any longer; 1 broke down and cried.My bosses were astonished at how cleverly 1 was able to hide my identity.There were numerous question and answers. I was very well liked there.They didn't want me to leave, so I stayed on another three months. Oneof the bosses told me, "You should have remained a Ilona Lipcsej; younever know, history repeats itself”. My reply was, "Now the tables willturn on you for your misdeeds”.One afternoon, a messenger brought me a letter form Suriko Weiss,saying that my sister, Rachel, had returned from Auschwitz and that shewas in her house. 1 rushed with some clothes to meet her. Poor thing; shewas all swollen, had barely any hair, but I was very happy to see her again.1 placed her with a childless distant relative, very fine people, the Lasslos.The rest of my family, my parents, three sisters and two brothers perishedin Auschwitz.I met Menus Klein and he told me that he was going to Prague. Sincethe borders were still unsettled, one could travel without a passport. I toldhim I would go along. In the meantime, I had heard that my cousin, Mendi796 - The Bilker Memorial BookBohm was in Prague; I surely wanted to see him. While I was in Prague,Mendi and 1 became engaged. On the way home from a restaurant, wesaw a group of people standing in front of our apartment house. Amongthem was Mendi and a soldier. A man was walking toward us; he wasMoshe Berger (whose father was Meyer Berge), and we were pleasantlysurprised to see him. As we came closer to the rest of the people, to ourgreat surprise the soldier was my Uncle Norman. 1 couldn’t believe myeyes; the excitement was too much to bear.We all went into the apartment. Uncle Norman told me that he hadreceived a telegram from Uncle Louis, his brother. Uncle Louis hadreceived my telegram from Budapest. Through the American consulate,he in turn cabled his brother, Norman, in Germany, where he was stationed,and asked him to look me up right away in Budapest. He was going toBudapest via Prague, where he made a stopover. The train was supposedto leave at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. In order to pass the time, he wentto the Y.M.C.A. where all the refugees gathered. He met a young man andgave him a package of American cigarettes, which was a great deal, andasked him to go from table to table to ask if anyone was from Bilke.It didn't take long to find a table full of Bilker men, and they gatheredaround him: Chayim Bohm, Moshe Berger, David Heisler, EliezerSchwimmer, Menachem Klein and others. Naturally, everyone was gladto see him. They asked him, "What are you doing in Prague?” He answered,"I'm on my way to Budapest to see Rifkele Josovic". They said, "You don'thave to go far, Rifkele is right here in Prague".This was the group of people waiting for me in front of the apartmenthouse. Aftre three days’ leave of absence, with a heavy heart, we saidgoodbye: "I will see you, G“d willing, in America”.4' NX'v-'T’s^. 'Jr .^ '•.»--“r's^.

There ismy aunt Sarah looking so cosmopolitan in her stylish hat and collar. MyUncle Daniel, as handsome as any Hollywood movie star, in his armyuniform. And 1 look at them often, knowing that if I look hard and longenough I will see my own eyes, my wide cheekbones, the wry smile.Who do I look like? I look like them all. Sometimes when I look inthe mirror I am surprised to see someone elses's face. Today I'm Roslyn;tomorrow I'm Margaret, the next day I am my Aunt Irene. But there arealways my father's eyes gazing back at me, clear and blue grey.1 am very much the American, flowing comfortably through themelting pot. Modem and educated, I live in the mainstream. But my faceis that of the Mechlowitz family of Bilke, and a part of me will alwayslive there. Over and over, I try to picture what it was like in the town ofmy father, of my grandparents. I seek the stories, I record the names. Iimagine my grandfather's creative efforts to feed his large family “ makingmatzohs one day, gathering grapes or lumber the next. And 1 can almosthear my grandmother inviting a passerby into their small house for"something to eat". Just as 1 still hear my father say, "Are you hungry?Here's something to eat".Did you know my father, Azriel Mechlowitz, as a boy? Let me tell yousomething about the man he became.

The map aboveshows some of these ghettos, with theapproximate numbers held in them.On entering each Hungarian town orvillage, one Ccscapo method was to seiaeseveral leading citiaens, and then threaten tokill them unless the community agreed to apunitive ransom. In this way, the Jews of thetown were impoverisiied overnight, withouteven the money to buy railway tickets. Theransom exercise also made the SS seemplausible; they had said they would releasethe ho.stages as soon as the money was paid,and they had kept their word. When the SSthen said: 'we have orders to put you in bncklactones and timber y ards md no ham willivme to you’, it could be believed. 'C^itcsoon’, the SS told those who had been thusconfined, ‘you will go east to help with tiicharvest.*On 15 May 1944 Jiedeportations to Auschwitz began. By midJune a total of289,357 Jews had beendeported to Auschwitz from Rutbenia auJnorthern TransylvaniaThe map gives the approximatenumber of Jews knosvn to have b<^deported to Auschwitz and then gassedthere, from 6.3 towns and villages in castciuI inngary. The places shown here amount tono more than half of the towns and villagetin this region alone from which Jews weredeported.u»u£jiHpri mtnn mts3
