I also saw Shoyel Siegman himself, who lived above his store, pouring pots ofhot coals onto the hooligans, while his sons poured boiling water from the otherwindow. Then came the terrible news: a childhood friend of mine, David Grubner,who had taken back a pack full of loot from a Polish hooligan, had been shot dead onthe spot. May his shining memory always survive among these lines I am writingabout my dear, unforgettable town of Chrzanow. The date was November 5, 1918,the first black day in the history of Jewish Chrzanow in liberated Poland. It was thefirst pogrom I had seen in my life. The next day the self-defense group from Cracowsent us a company armed with grenades and guns. They wanted to take thoroughrevenge for the bloody night we had lived through. My house became a weaponsmagazine. We quickly called a small meeting, and decided not to start a war yet. In-stead we would wait a day, and if the band of gangsters showed up again, we wouldbegin to fight. Our beloved Cracow comrades didn't like this idea. We barely con-vinced them to wait patiently. Fortunately the hooligans didn't come back, and ourcomrades took the train back home late at night.The Jews of Chrzanow lived in panic for a short time. They ran wherever theycould, but it didn't help. The wave of anti-Semitic pogroms raged all across Polandand Galicia. Jews didn't know what to do with their meager savings. I rememberwhen Reb Leybish—the son-in-law of "Red Lome"—came to me and said that hewanted to transfer his money to Erets Israel. He wanted me to go to the Jewish Na-tional Fund in Vienna and transfer his capital to them, donating half of the sum, andhaving them invest the other half in Erets Israel. And this was a Jew who in normaltimes avoided Zionists like the plague.Everything I have written describes events that took place up until 1918, because afew months later I left Chrzanow. And whenever you, my dear brothers fromChrzanow, read these words, remember that once there was a fine Jewish city calledChrzanow, which pulsed with rich Jewishness, and boasted worthy Jews. Thewonderful young people who always dreamed of their own land will never return.The city which gave us so much should not be forgotten, but kept in loving memory.And you, cursed world, will one day have to answer: "Why were you apathetic,why did you let my ten thousand brothers and sisters, pure, innocent souls, beslaughtered?" The blood which was spilled cries out for revenge, and my one prayerto you, God, is that we may live to see such revenge!New York, March 1949136Supplementthose Jewish youth who had served in the Austrian military. A small group went tomeet the hooligans, and there was an encounter on the road to Auschwitz betweenthe small Jewish group and the hundreds of peasants. The latter were armed withscythes, and some had horses and wagons, ready to cart away the Jewish goods theyexpected to loot. This time our heroic Jewish youth turned the hooligans back.When we expected the hooligans to attack Chrzanow, respected Jews such as Dr.Adolf Rieser, Reb Zisman Kinreich, Reb Shoyel Siegman and others appealed to themayor. They brought the coming pogrom to his attention, and he permitted theJewish youth to arm and prepare to defend themselves.However, when it was discovered that the hooligans had been defeated by theJewish youth, the commandant ordered the gendarmes to disarm all the Jews whowere in possession of means of defense. And thus it was that as soon as the Jewishself-defense unit returned home, they were disarmed, and Jewish Chrzanow wasthere for the taking. We immediately called a meeting of selected individuals at thecommunity headquarters. Some people were absolutely against any form of resis-tance, thinking that this would avoid casualties. Others, including Reb Mendele, theson of Rabbi Naftoli (and later rabbi in Chrzanow himself), were for defendingourselves. Nothing came out of the meeting. Meanwhile panic began to spread. Alarge crowd of peasant men and women filled the marketplace, ready with horsesand wagons. Some of the hooligans had swords, some had scythes, and the rest hadother kinds of weapons. It was frightening. Jews closed up their shops; the mer-chants at the market place were terrified. Everyone ran home, and when night fellwe heard Jewish shops being broken into as the Polish hooligans stole Jewish goodsand packed them onto their wagons. Shots were heard, and as the night grew darkerwe heard more and more Jewish shutters breaking. The peasants were helped out bya certain local criminal who had spent several years in prison.I went out into the street to see what was going on. It was a genuine pogrom,organized to the last detail. Peasant men and women were carrying Jewish goods.The wife of Zilish the wigmaker looked out her window (she lived at the home ofLeybish Jungenwirt). While she stood looking out a hooligan shot out her eye.Several of us young people got together and decided to save what we could. Thefirst thing to do was to try to take back what the peasants had stolen. We were par-tially successful. I went out into the market place, where all the shops had beenlooted, and saw Father Kaminsky standing there with a few commissars, enjoyingthemselves. I went up to a commissar whom I knew, and asked him why he was do-ing nothing to stop the pogrom. He said to me, "The police know what they're do-ing. They have precise orders..." He advised me that I'd be safer if I went home.One group of anti-Semites was led by a lawyer, whose rotten name I've forgotten—Ionly remember that he had pimples. (This was doubtless Dr. Janikowski—M.B.)They went up to the rabbi, doubtless wanting to harm him in some way. We im-mediately warned Rabbi Mendele to avoid them. The rabbi deserves praise, for hewent around the city, shouting "Jews, don't be apathetic! Go out into the street andfight back!"I went back into the market and saw the gangsters breaking into Shoyel Siegman's135Chrzanowtions, and the boycott of the cinema came to an end.We immediately set about organizing the first Yiddish Peretz evening in the Sokolhall. I went to Cracow to speak to my dear comrade Dr. Yitskhok Schiper, anddescribed the victory we had won over the anti-Semites of Chrzanow. At the sametime I invited him to speak at the evening devoted to Y.L. Peretz. Dr. Schiper, whowas very fond of Chrzanow, refused. He explained that he was a soldier, and hecouldn't give any lectures while in uniform. I came up with an idea: "Fine! Come toChrzanow on furlough. Before the evening begins, you can change into civilianclothes and speak as a civilian." Schiper approved the idea, and came. Shortlybefore he was to go on, we realized that we didn't have a suit that fit him. Just thenMotl Rosner came along. He was exactly Dr. Schiper's size. In the wings they ex-changed clothes, and Motl Rosner stood backstage in Schiper's uniform until Dr.Schiper was finished.On that occasion Dr. Schiper drew a parallel between the drama Vesele-Weding bythe Polish writer Vespianski and Y.L. Peretz' The Golden Chain. I'll never forget thehistorical comparisons Schiper drew between Polish Jews and non-Jewish Poles,when he finished his speech. "For you Poles, Vespianski, through his Chochol,leaves a rope, while our Peretz leaves us a golden chain. As Reb Shloyme shouts:'Sabbath, let us keep the Sabbath! Don't let the weekday in, let us keep theSabbath!"'And thus from time to time we arranged Jewish evenings in the anti-Semitic PolishSokol hall. Meanwhile history was moving along. Austria collapsed; Poland becamean independent nation. We were all overjoyed and we immediately called an openmeeting in the synagogue. The speakers were Dr. Adolf Rieser and Dr. Krengel,who worked for Dr. Cyfer; he was a passionate Zionist and a sympathetic Jew. Iremember it as if it had just happened. The synagogue was packed with Jews whofelt a holy exaltation at Poland's liberation. The nation had broken its chains; a newPoland had arisen. My entire body trembled as I began to read in public the declara-tion from the Polish Jews to the Polish people:"Polish people! Remember that yesterday you were still enslaved, and today youare free. A new nation! Poland, remember that three and a half million Jews live inyour land. They are oppressed as a nation, just as the Poles were yesterday. We arehistorically bound to Poland. For a thousand years we have lived and sufferedtogether, but we have also struggled for your freedom, Polish people! We wish yougood fortune in your renewed national existence." This declaration was given to thecommandant, and with it the celebration ended.A very short time after that evening, the anti-Semitic beast began to rage in earnestin our town. The anti-Semites in Chrzanow began to hatch dark plans. Father Ka-minsky became more active. I frequently saw him heading toward the Sokol in hislong, black Jesuit coat, certainly going to meetings to discuss how to harm Jews. Atthe church he gave sermons telling his congregation not to buy from Jews. He saidJews should go to Palestine. Tension grew from day to day. Then we found out that aband of peasant hooligans were planning to come from Auschwitz to carry out ananti-Jewish pogrom. Our young people recruited a self-defense group from among134Supplementtranslation. I would like to mention the kindness of H. Druker, the clerk at the com-mandant's office, a sympathetic nationalist and religious Jew, and well-versed in therabbinic texts. He always helped us out of difficult situations, so that we were able tocontinue with our Jewish cultural work.During the period when the Russian armies were marching through Austrian ter-ritory, when they stood beneath the walls of the Cracow fortress, and the Germanand Austrian armies were retreating toward Breslau, the convert Henryk Lowenfeldappeared out of thin air. People in Chrzanow claimed that Henryk had been heavilyinvolved in war business in France, speculating on a German victory, but after theGerman defeats there he had lost all his money. When he came to Chrzanow, heapparently wanted to recoup his losses at the expense of the Jews. Helped by thecommandant and his gendarmes, Henryk managed to confiscate the inventories ofJewish stores, claiming that Jews were dealing on the black market. Aided by theauthorities, he actually managed to take a vast amount of goods away from Jews,which he sold in his courtyard, at a high rate and only to Gentiles. He grew rich onthese deals, because they didn't cost him a cent. And again I have to quote Rashi:“Cursed are the wicked, for their good deeds have an ulterior motive."Meanwhile, in 1916 and 1917, the Poles began actively agitating on behalf of theirnational revival. In Chrzanow they founded the first mandolin orchestra, and alsoconducted film showings in the Sokol, a center of Polish anti-Semitic reaction whereall the Polish events were held. The hall was always packed with Jews during theperformances on Saturday night and Sunday. One time the Jewish cultural commit-tee wanted to hold an evening devoted to Peretz and requested the use of the Sokolhall. They told us that they didn't want the hall to be used for a Jewish event atwhich Yiddish would be spoken. In addition, they cursed us roundly for having thenerve to ask.This led to a spontaneous boycott against the cinema among the Jewish youth,who decided not to go until the Sokol hall was made available for Jewish use. Thefirst Saturday night came and the program director was looking forward to a largecrowd. The time came for the show to begin, but the hall was empty. The youngJews weren't there. The mandolin orchestra played to the bare walls; the administra-tion was nervous: What was going on? One of the Sokol members asked me, “Doyou have some sort of holiday today?" (There were no film showings on Jewishholidays.) I took him out onto the Plantn and showed him that it was a beautifulnight. The full moon glittered on the green leaves of the trees along the Plantn.Jewish boys and girls were strolling among the shadows of the trees, and the strainsof a Yiddish song could be heard.“Perhaps they'll come tomorrow," I said to him.He took his leave with a bitter “Good night." I'm sure he didn't have a goodnight.The next day, the following week and the week after that the hall was empty. ThePoles were discouraged, seeing that their initiative was hopeless; the vicious FatherKaminsky grew sick from distress. Eventually they came to their senses and beganto reckon with us. We got the Sokol to permit us to use their hall for Jewish produc-133ChrzanbwWe, the Jewish community center committee—consisting of Dr. Rieser, Dr. Cyfer,Boruch Kinreich, M. Shor, M. Rosner, Yachtsye Rosner, Miriam Friedlander andothers whose names I do not recall—went to Henryk Lowenfeld and outlined ourmodest plan to him. He listened attentively to our ideas, and answered like a truephilanthropist: "Certainly, I'm interested in the town's well being, especiallybecause there is a contingent of fine, modern young people in town, who dress inmodern clothing, in short jackets and without peyes. But why such a modestbuilding? I'll build you at my own expense a huge building with a modern theaterand a modern library. It will have a gymnasium with equipment, and a bath thatisn't a mikvah. Beautiful monuments will be set up in front of the building. Abuilding like that will cost a lot of money, but don't worry about that. It's my prob-lem. However," said Henryk, "I want the entire population of Chrzanow to be in-volved in this undertaking." He recognized Boruch Kinreich and asked him, "Whyisn't your father Zisman Kinreich involved in this committee?" Boruch explained tohim the gap between ourselves and the Chasidic circles, but Henryk couldn't under-stand it at all.For the time being he gave us the money to open a Jewish lending library. We wereto buy the best of Yiddish and world literature, and in order to see to it thateverything went properly, he asked his brother Adolf Lowenfeld to supervise thelibrary. Henryk got quite involved in the plan, going as far as to hire an architect. Healso consulted with the heads of the Jewish community, to whom he proposed amore ambitious plan, which would have included a modern old age home, an or-phanage, a free kitchen, et cetera. He also offered to rebuild the synagogue. But, asRashi says, "Cursed are the wicked, for their good deeds have an ulterior motive."He added a minor condition: no more and no less than that the convert's portraitshould hang prominently in the synagogue. When the community officerscategorically refused, he went away taking all his plans with him, and didn't want tohear any more about the Jews of Chrzanow. However, he kept his promise to givemoney for a library, which was extremely useful to the young people of Chrzanow.Life in Chrzanow was Jewish and calm. Jews and Gentiles lived together in peace,although anti-Semites appeared among the Gentiles, led by the cursed FatherKaminsky. Nevertheless, there were no public incidents of anti-Semitism. On thecontrary, I noticed that even at the lending library where the Jewish girls and boysborrowed the finest contemporary literature, Gentile girls also borrowed books.They were quite welcome among us.In August 1914 Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian crown, was shot at Sara-jevo. Austria and Germany declared war on Russia, and World War I started. The ef-fect was like an earthquake. Young men and old were inducted into the military,among them our best comrades. As in all wars, normal life stopped, and there wasno cultural activity. The government regulated social activities, no public lecturescould be held on political topics, and even the content of lectures concerningliterature or science had to be cleared with the authorities. The commandant and hisassistants kept an eye on cultural activists. We were constantly called to the com-mandant's office to report on the plays we were planning to produce, or to provide a132Supplementtroop and genuinely helpful to us. We needed wigs, beard, makeup, mastic and allthe other requirements of a theatrical troop. Since Klein often traveled to Katowice,he went to the municipal theater there, bought everything in his own account, anddidn't want us to pay him back. I remember that when he brought me a wig so Icould play Reb Zerach in With the Stream, he said to me, "Leo Slezak (a famoussinger and actor) wore this wig when he came to Katowice as a guest star." He en-vied the opportunity I had to wear Slezak's wig. Of course, I considered it a greathonor.Some time later we performed Gordon's The Wild Man. The madman was playedso convincingly by Shloyme Grubner that sometimes I felt that "Lemekh" reallywas crazy. In the play Lemekh hates his father, whom I played. In the second actLemekh tore off half of his father's beard. I ran offstage to fix my beard, but theprompter gave me my cue to come back. Motl Rosner took a kerchief and quicklytied it around my head. My half beard stuck out. Motl said to me, "Complain thatyour teeth hurt." When I came back onstage, I shouted, "Oy, my teeth!" The entireaudience began laughing, and Shloyme forgot that he was crazy and began to laughhysterically. Instead of giving us our lines, the prompter burst out laughing, and themore he looked at me the harder he laughed. Actors and audience alike keptlaughing, until eventually everyone calmed down and we brought our play to a suc-cessful conclusion.When we performed Peretz Hirschbein's The Agreement, our theater was visited bythe Yiddish poet Shayevitsh. After the show he heartily thanked us for the pleasurewe had given him. Our theatrical performances were also attended by the well-known Professor Adolf Lowenfeld from Chrzanow and his son, a sculptor.Although they were converts, they enjoyed spending time among us, and they en-joyed the activities of the Jewish youth of Chrzanow.Our repertoire also included a number of classical dramas. We don't have thespace here to list each one; suffice it to mention Karl Gutskov's Uriel Acosta and JacobGordon's The Slaughter, both of which were performed in an artistically sound man-ner. In fact, when a Jewish theater troupe once came to Chrzanow, they immediatelyleft, saying that their second-rate productions would get nowhere in Chrzanow.Thus our cultural work was carried out under the capable direction of Motl Rosner.We decided to build a Jewish community center. Zelinger's hall was too small for ourproductions. In a Jewish community center we would open a Yiddish library, areading room, and a theater with a real stage. This effort, then, would constitute ourcultural program. We assembled all of the nationalistic organizations in Chrzanowfor this purpose. Every organization came to the first meeting except for the Bund,which did not want to take part. They would have participated if it had been an inter-nationalist community center. A committee including all the organizations waselected at the first meeting, and a plan was adopted regarding finances and otherpractical issues. We appealed to Henryk Lowenfeld, known to be a generous philan-thropist, who even though he was a convert, nevertheless helped poor Jews.Mothers who had to arrange their daughters' weddings and lacked the necessaryfunds for a dowry would go to Henryk, and he would help them.131Chrzanowpermission, on condition that she appear only with me. Thus, I played Abraham;she played Sarah; Chaiml Grubner was Lot; Shloyme Grubner was Eliezer, andIsaac was played by David Wachsberg (Fonye), who was red-haired but handsome,and who fell during World War I. With his silk shirt and his head of red hair, he wastruly a fine Isaac. I don't remember who else was in the play.One comic incident should be mentioned here. We needed a donkey to take Isaacto the altar. But where could we find a donkey in Chrzanow? Reb Mordechai Blitzerhad a billy goat, and David and Leyb Blitzer, his sons, were members of our society.(David was our prompter, and he did the job well.) We borrowed the billy goat to useinstead of a donkey.We played in a large room in Berish Frister's house, on a stage hammered togetherwith boards. Among the audience were the two daughters of the goat's owner, en-joying the scene. When the time came for Isaac to ride to the altar on the donkey,there was no way we could convince the goat to go up onto the stage. Finally, LeybBlitzer grabbed the goat's tail and dragged it up onto the stage, and God shouted atAbraham, "Don't lay your hand on the lad!" The scene was going smoothly; the au-dience was in suspense, and many people were sobbing at the sad scene. Then sud-denly the goat recognized his mistress Maltsye Blitzer, and with one leap abandonedIsaac and Abraham in the middle of the story, went up to Maltsye and bleated, as ifto say, "What do they want from me?" The goat went wild, running among the au-dience and driving them out of the room, while we stood frozen on the stage. A sillygoat had ruined our performance! This was the first theatrical experiment inChrzanow.Later we undertook a production of Sholem Asch's With the Stream. We workedhard, each of us studying his or her lines. Since the girls couldn't read Yiddish, theirparts were written out in Latin letters, and they learned them thoroughly. When wehad all memorized our parts, we needed costumes. I was to play the role of RebZerach, who wore a long silk coat. What was I to do? I took my father's silk coat, mayhe rest in peace. Unfortunately I forgot to return it after the performance, and myfather's Sabbath was disrupted. He wondered who had taken his coat—certainlynot a thief, because a thief would also have taken the gold and silver which was inthe same closet.Naturally, I brought the coat home secretly during the week, so that he wouldn'tnotice, and put it away somewhere else. On Sabbath morning my father went overthe Torah, reading in a sweet melody, and said a Psalm. However, he was ashamedto pray in his weekday clothes. I pretended I was looking and "found" his coat...But we had to perform again the following week. I couldn't take the coat from myfather again, because he had put it in a secure place right after the Sabbath.Desperate, I ran into Peretz Klein (Falek) and told him what was going on. He said,"You know what? I'll steal my father's silk coat." Thus I played Reb Zerach again,this time in Reb Kalmen Klein's coat. (He, incidentally, was the richest man intown.)Falek Klein, who died of starvation in Russia, deserves to be rememberedhonorably. A son of wealthy parents, he was nevertheless quite loyal to our amateur130Supplementing. We needed a Jewish intellectual to introduce Zhitlowsky, a person familiar withZhitlowsky's writings. Who in Chrzanow knew about Zhitlowsky? A certainHebrew teacher in town (I've forgotten his name) told us that he was well ac-quainted with Zhitlowsky's writings, and that he would do the introduction, oncondition that he be allowed to speak Hebrew. We were astonished. Zhitlowsky wasa passionate Yiddishist, so of course we couldn't permit him to do the introduction.The comrades decided that Mordechai Shor was going to introduce Zhitlowsky. Icertainly don't remember what I said in my introduction, but I do remember thatbefore he began he called me over, shook my hand, and thanked me in front of theentire crowd for the few sincere words I had said.The second problem was finding a suitable hall for the evening. We decided to getthe hall at the municipal building and, after some difficulty, we succeeded. Therewas a worker there named Palka, a Gentile, and one of the firemen. I told him, "I'llpay you well, but be sure that the spotlight is polished and the hall clean, because aphilosopher from America is coming to speak." Palka set to work, cleaning the hallproperly. The Gentile imagined that a philosopher, especially one from America,would look different than the rest of us, mere flesh and blood.When the evening came, and Palka saw a short Jew with a goatee, a gold chain onhis vest—in short, the very image of a Jewish merchant—he shouted to me, "What'sthis? That Yid isn't a philosopher! " When I told Zhitlowsky the next day, he laughed.Many years later in New York I had the chance to remind him of that incident.Our "literary discussions" are a chapter unto themselves. Every Friday eveningwe held these discussions in the large hall on the Plantn, and it's no exaggeration tosay that the room was packed. People even stood on the window frames. I can stillsee before me the sweet, lovely Jewish girls and the good-hearted boys who wouldlisten attentively to the fine literary selections by our classic writers which I wouldread aloud. My listeners hung on every word, and then took part in the discussion.My heart bleeds when I remember that all of those fine young people are no longeralive... I still remember the evening we arranged for the poet Avrom Wieviorka,who was so brutally slaughtered by the Nazis. The Chasidim decided to attack us.Of course we repulsed them, but I went home wounded by Tall Yoske's nails. I cer-tainly bear no hatred toward him, since he didn't disrupt our evening at all.We decided to perform Yiddish theater. One of our performers was a barber'sassistant who worked for Johann Tauzowicz. His name was Kessler, and he hadtheatrical ambitions. The first piece we performed was a one-acter by Sholem-Aleychem called Advice. It went smoothly, and we were quite successful. I came upwith the idea of doing Goldfaden's Binding of Isaac. For that, however, we neededfemale performers—and what young woman from Chrzanow would appear on thestage with boys?The first pioneer among the young women of Chrzanow was Yochtshe Rosner.God knows whether she is still alive. She was Yoysef Melech's daughter. She said tome, "If my mother lets me. I'll be in your play." I asked her mother myself, promis-ing that I would be responsible for maintaining moral standards. Her mother gave129Chrzanowwould have me arrested and accused of sabotage by the Austrian educationministry, which set the program for all of the evening schools in the empire. Weweren't frightened by his answer, and we began organizing the Jewish workingyouth of Chrzanow. After feverish activity we managed to achieve excellent results.We got rid of the hard work the younger children formerly had to do at night, andthe boys were no longer subject to beatings. After work the apprentices came to thesociety, where various courses were held. The boys borrowed books and subscribedto newspapers. Thus Chrzanow came to possess a fine group of young people, ofwhom we were all proud. Among those who helped in this work were my dearfriends Motl Rosner, Karpl Goldshteyn, my brother Avrom Shor, Wolf Katz,Shloyme Grubner, Shimen Laufer, and others. Our assigments were to arrange for:1. Public discussions of issues facing the Jewish people;2. Literary discussions;3. Distribution of Yiddish books;4. Instruction in speaking and writing Yiddish well;5. Theatrical performances; and6. Improving the economic situation of the proletarian youth of Chrzanow.Among the speakers who visited us I remember the brilliant personalities ofZerubavel, Alexander Chashin, Chrzanowicz (Kasriel), Nachman Mifelev (whocame to Chrzanow countless times and came to like the town very much).Yakov Kener and Binyomin Kohn once missed the train back to Cracow. They hadto spend the entire night walking around the town, because not a single hotel wouldgive these "bums” a place to sleep. Kutz the night watchman saw them, and almostarrested them. I was wakened in the middle of the night, and thanks to BerishKleber, a Jewish night watchman, I managed to get the two comrades out of jail.Among the shining Jewish luminaries which Chrzanow often heard was Dr. Yits-khok Shifer, who was very fond of Chrzanow and closely connected with the city.When Dr. Shmuel Cyfer was inducted into the Austrian army during World War I,Dr. Yitskhok Shifer took over his practice, and lived in Chrzanow for a while. BerlLoker, too, was always happy to come to Chrzanow.The magnificent Dr. Natan Birnbaum always related that as a young man, when hepassed through town on his way to Vienna, he always stopped in Chrzanow for acouple of hours. Once, on Purim, he laughed loudly on seeing a Jew in costume,wearing a silk coat and a shtreimel, riding a horse and carrying an etrog and a lulav.Dr. Natan Birnbaum was very fond of Chrzanow and often gave talks about variousJewish themes. Birnbaum said that Chrzanow encouraged him to return to Judaism.In the winter of 1917 or 19181 was in Vienna. I went to see Dr. Birnbaum to invite himto appear in Chrzanow. He said to me, "Shor! I have nothing to say to you, becausemy views are altogether different now... Have you read my new book, God's Peo-ple? Read it—yes. I'll come to Chrzanow, but the ones I speak to will be your piousfathers..." Birnbaum never came to Chrzanow again.When Dr. Chaim Zhitlowsky came to Chrzanow, he spoke on the theme "Jew andHuman." I still remember how anxious we were when we prepared for that even-128Supplementyouth, were workers in every trade who became organized in our society. Workerswere terribly exploited at the time. People were still a bit ashamed of being artisans. Iremember Jewish mothers complaining, "My child is going to be a tailor, or ashoemaker? It can't be helped! He doesn't have anything to do, he doesn't want tostudy in the study house, so rather than being completely idle, let him become an ar-tisan. '' Then they would wipe a tear from their eyes. I still have an image in my mindof our artisans, organized in a modern association, going to pray twice a day, withtheir tefilin bags under their arms in the morning, and then to the afternoon andevening prayers later on. I still remember artisans in silken coats with velvet hatsgirding themselves with deep red silk belts, proudly, joyously marching to thesynagogue, and the Chevra-Kvaytim, or the Psalm Society synagogue. Indeed theyenjoyed their prayers, and they took deep pleasure in the Sabbath.Our most important assignment was organizing the apprentices. In those years aboy was given to work for a master for two or three years, during which time he wastaught the trade. Their situation was hardly enviable. The masters didn't haveenough for themselves, so what could they give the apprentices to eat? The appren-tice was actually a servant. He had to do housework, cleaning the floors, caring forthe little ones, examining the older children in their Hebrew lessons. Then, late atnight, when everyone had already gone to sleep, the master would remember thathe had to teach his apprentice something. Thus the boy would sit up working untilmidnight. No sooner had he fallen asleep, tired and aching, than he had to wake up,take the jugs and bring water from the pump. The jugs filled with water were oftenheavier than the boy carrying them, and his young body would double over. Whenhe finished bringing water, the apprentice had to bring breakfast for the senior ap-prentice who, if he didn't like what he was brought, would often smack the appren-tice.When the years of apprenticeship were over, the boy had to get a certificate fromthe guild. The guildmaster had to be bribed, so that he wouldn't ask too many ques-tions—otherwise the apprentice had to start over. Naturally, under such conditions,no apprentice could think about his intellectual development. He had no time toread a newspaper or a book, or to find out what was going on in the world. His bosssaw to it that the youth had no free time except for the Sabbath, because on Saturdaynight the boy had to go back to work. However, there was a trade school run by thegovernment, which forced the employers to send the apprentices for eveningcourses three times a week. The teachers were a gang of anti-Semites, who used tobeat the boys for every little thing, and the masters and apprentices collaborated infinding ways to avoid the evening courses.These were the conditions in which we undertook to organize the young Jewishworkers. I remember going one time to see Dr. Kepler—at that time mayor of Chrza-now—and requesting that he investigate the situation of the apprentices. I said thatboth the general system of education and the curriculum itself should be appropriateto the intellectual capacities of the boys. Dr. Kepler, who was an intelligent personbut totally assimilated, answered that if I started a revolution in Chrzanow, heSupplementAT THE LAST moment, when the printing of the Book of Chrzanow had almost beencompleted, came the following contribution by Mordechai Shor. Because of the in-dividual prominence of the author, who was and remains an integral component ofour community, and also because of the wealth of historical material herein, whichfills in several gaps in the first part of the book, I decided to include this contributionas an appendix. Better late than never, dear Mordechai Shor!-M.B.Mordechai ShorA Chapter of Chrzanow MemoriesThe first official Zionist society in Chrzanow was established around 1900 by Dr.Adolf Rieser. The members were boys from bourgeois Chasidic families and artisans,who still wore satin overcoats on the Sabbath. Among the first members, to the best ofmy recollection, were Zachariah Schwartzbart, Chaim Moyshe Shifer, the brothersMoyshe and Chaim Richter (Mizhl), Dr. Shmuel Cyfer, Bunem Sonenschein, AvromBerger from Kvotsole, Hershl Klein, Shloyme Guter, Shimen Wolf Yungenvirt (thebrother of Yoysef Yungenvirt, chairman of the Chrzanow society in Israel). Theenthusiasm of the boys who heard Dr. Rieser's opening Zionist speech wasboundless. Every evening the members gathered. The Zionist World and theLemberg Togblat, the German Vienna papers Die Zeit and Freie Presse, and Hebrewpublications such as Hamitspe, Hashiloach, and Sokolov's Hatsefire were readilyavailable. There was a library with classics of Jewish literature, Frug and Bialik'spoems, the tales of Peretz and Sholem-Aleychem were the spiritual sustenance ofthe boys who belonged to the first Zionist society.In 1905 an opposition group was created. Motl Rosner and Yekhiel Unger, whoworked in Cracow, met and established Poalei Zion in Chrzanow. Among the initialfounders were Wolf Katz, a shoemaker in a silk coat; Moyshe, the son of the custo-dian of the Chevra-Kvaytim building; Reb Yakov Yoysef, a tailor in a silk coat; HershlLaufer, Avrom Shor, Itshe Beker from Vodne, and Shmuel Yosl Shulzinger; and sonsof Leyzer Goldschmid and Mordechai Shor. A house was rented on Cracow Street,not far from the rabbi's house. The Cracow department helped us considerably,sending speakers who discussed various themes concerning Jewish nationality andgeneral social and political issues.Thus began the nationalist and socialist Zionist activities of Chrzanow Poalei Zionin the areas of culture and politics. Those who joined us, in addition to bourgeois126Reb Moyshe Bochner* * *After the liberation, in Buchenwald. He wandered around the hospital where hewas staying, and heard that I was getting ready to travel somewhere, to get in touchwith the Jewish world. He came to see me in his underwear: "You're leaving?" Ididn't know how to respond to a man who had been my comrade in the camp forover two years...He felt lost: "What will happen to me? I haven't altogether regained my health!"I comforted him: "You'll go out and get some fresh air at the 'kibbutz,' and you'llget better.''He wouldn't calm down: "I'm alone in the world, except for my relatives in EretsIsrael..."I comforted him again: "Wait a bit... You'll see. I'll come back, and I'll have newsfor you. Maybe you'll soon be able to go to Erets Israel, and start a new life there...The main thing is to wait patiently! You know what," I proposed to him, "whydon't you write something meanwhile. I'll come back, and we'll write together,especially about Skarzsyske."He smiled like a child for a while: "You're right! About Skarzsyske! But will youreally come back?"... A crazy world, a strange life: I didn't go back, and he didn't survive...125Chrzanowing the urgent news to all the Jews, including my former T and my former 'you'...Will we be able to do it?"The trees outside spread their branches, as if looking all around themselves for theanswer.* * *He was stubborn in the camp. He took on himself the task of a political agitator. Hecarried out his task whatever the circumstances. Somehow this person managed toget hold of the daily German and Polish press. He used to read it from cover to cover,and then crawl from one bunk to another in the dark barracks, telling every skeletonon its bit of rotten straw:"A revolution in Czech territory! Heidrich's been killed!"I could never understand how this stinging cynic abandoned his ironic tone whenhe did this. He would take out the bit of folded newspaper for the hundredth time,and read it over and over again to anyone who came along... What did he do withhis nervous impatience then?He never grew tired of repeating for the umpteenth time to the half-dead bodies:"It won't take long now, kids! If Isay it, you can believe me." And the miracle wasthat they did believe him.* * *He laughed at everything in the world, including life and its dangers. He wasn'tcareful enough with the newspaper, simply stuck it into his outside pocket. Thefoolish newspaper stuck its head out, curious to see what was going on in theworld... The drunken chief guard of our Skarzsyske camp saw the Jew with thephilosophical demeanor, saw the Jew's newspaper trying to make up its mindwhether to come out or not. He barked out angrily: "What kind of politics are youpromoting in the camp?" A thorough inspection of the depths of the Jew's pocketsrevealed a whole collection of newspapers, beginning with the previous year andcontinuing until the day before yesterday... The drunk was possessed by a kind ofcuriosity: "What do you need that stuff for? Politics? What?"But the cold, steely eyes of the Jew looked him straight in the eye: "Toilet paper,Herr Chief Guard!'' He pretended that he kept the newspaper because he wanted tosupply the entire camp with good toilet paper. The chief guard saw that he was deal-ing with some kind of mad obsession. But here was one thing he couldn't under-stand. One newspaper was quite recent. Was he mixed up in politics, that "slyJew"?But the cold eyes of the only Jew who looked him straight in the eye answeredclearly: "I can't read, and I can't tell dates, Herr Chief Guard!"He got off with a few blows for his "fresh look." Then he made his way to thenearest barrack, and collapsed by the first bunk closest to the door:"Hey, you! Sleeping? Voronezh has fallen!"124Reb Moyshe Bochnercities, he was simply curious to see who would win. And when one part of himbegan to grow terrified whenever he unconsciously began to hum a Hebrewmelody; when he wanted to retain his earlier convictions, and tried to remonstratewith himself: "You're going to become a Jew through and through!"—then heheard a bold, resounding voice deep inside saying, "I hope so!"... And thus it went, until his own individual struggle placed him in the thick of astruggle between peoples and worlds...3.We sat together one evening in the camp, after a day during which there had beenno selection and no extra work at night. We were tired of discussing politics. We letour minds rest a while, and expressed our feelings.Kurtz was the first one to begin his inimitable improvised paraphrases:"Under the green treesMoysheles played, and Shloymeles..."Each one of us remembered something different. I remember the last Moyshelesand Shloymeles among my neighbors, everyday Jews, lying with their skulls split onthe same streets where they had once played... And he was thinking of his owneight-year-old "Moyshele," who would never look at the skies of Staszow, at thecotton clouds, through his "pure Jewish eyes..." In the midst of these dreams hebecame agitated:"Listen! I don't have anyone to blame except myself! You see my hair? I shouldpull it all out, one by one! Do you know on whose account they turned gray?"He was silent for a minute, his throat choked, until he shouted out, "It's on ac-count of them that there are wrinkles all over my face. It's on account of them, thebeasts, that every hair in my head is gray! I wanted to make a better world for them,and now my own hair disgusts me..."His mind worked for a while. Various notions tried to block an idea that wanted towork its way to his lips... Finally the idea burst out:"You know what I think? A short summary for a long life: We are alone, and weare utterly alienated. We are alienated from others and alienated from ourselves. Wewant to listen to everyone except ourselves. You can't fully comprehend the other.You remain a stranger to him. You don't listen to yourself. If you're not for yourself,then your wife doesn't belong to you, and your child doesn't belong to you... Inever wanted to believe that, until the hand of the best and the finest came andsmashed my child's life on the cobblestones, until it took my wife away wherever itwanted to... And what about me? And the only reason for it is that we didn't takethings into our own hands. They took us, like abandoned property..."For a while he was silent in the barracks room. I kept silent with him, and when hebegan speaking again, it seemed to me that the lice-ridden straw mattress and thebarbed wire surrounding us were speaking as well:"We have to start our own revolution! We Jewish concentration camp inmateshave to shout so loud that our words will be carried around the entire world, bring-123ChrzanowI saw in his eyes for the first time in years a sense of certainty. He was confident ofwhat was to come, he believed in himself again... "You'll see," he said, "you'll behearing about me and my work."And we did hear about him—for the last time.2.During rest periods in the camp, in the darkness of the barracks, he told me his lifestory.He was born to a rich father, a wine merchant who lived in Chrzanow. As aseventeen-year-old yeshiva student, he ran off "to see the world." He wanderedwithout finding a place to settle. He suffered hunger in Prague, then he traveledthrough Vienna, Paris, Berlin... He began to study chemistry, but abandoned hisstudies and wandered over hill and dale through Czech Bohemia. The energeticChrzanow youth was soon taken up with work producing the illegal press and litera-ture. He stole across borders; carried literature from place to place, wrote andedited... He got caught, managed to get free and got used to living underground. Itwas a game for this temperamental young agitator—both publishing antiwarliterature somewhere, and also distributing it among the German workers. He evensigned up as a worker in the Silesian coal mines, in order to come into close contactwith the Polish and German coal miners...... Newborn Poland gave him his first chance to speak openly. He ran for thePolish parliament in the twenties, traveling around delivering radical campaignspeeches. But he was soon assigned to a "better" place, where his tempestuousnature was somewhat restrained. In various Polish prisons he became intimately ac-quainted with various methods used by the Polish secret police, such as pouringboiling hot water into the nostrils and hanging the victim upside down.He came out tired and broken. He sought common happiness, got married andopened a pharmacy... His wife sat next to the little bottles of medicine, while hespent entire days and nights in the attic. As in his yeshiva years, he sat next to asingle candle for entire weeks, smoking, nibbling on a piece of sugar and reading...He read all of Hebrew and Yiddish literature, from the first page to the last, tryingto etch every last detail into his memory. Nor did he keep what he had read storedaway in a back room of his mind. Leivick argued a certain point with Tshapek, andBialik carried on a desperate, unequal struggle with Goethe... This went on evenafter these writers had been at home in his mind for years..... .He couldn't rid himself of his old ways. He wanted to retain what he hadsacrificed so many years for. But the Old-New Land came along. He began looking atit out of simple curiosity, but it fought its way in, taking over one room after anotherin his mind... He began to frequent Jewish circles, with the same casual curiosity.At first his notion was to convince the others (he wasn't ready to admit to himselfwhat lay beneath this excuse)... Later he began to grow a bit afraid: Would he beswept along himself? But bit by bit he lost his fear, and let the two forces competewithin him... Like a bystander watching a match between two teams from strange122Reb Moyshe BochnerMordechai StriglerEngineer Yakov Kurtz b/mThis portrait by Mordechai Strigler (Editor of The Jewish Forward) is an excellent de-scription of our fellow townsman Yukl Kurtz, m/b/a, a son of Yudl Kurtz (Shvinke). Itwas published in the jubilee issue of the Paris newspaper Undzer Vort in 1945.The news came like a blow to the head: Kurtz died! I don't even want to believe it.Could it be that this constantly restless person has also gone to his "eternal rest"?This was a person who played hide and seek with death for so long, always thumb-ing his nose at the danger that lurked. How could he go and die all by himself, afterthe liberation has already come?I remember how he always used to argue with me, that clever cynic and pessimist:You 11 see... I'll die after the liberation... Now, under the yoke of slavery. I'm ruledby a mad desire to see the world 'afterwards' for just one minute. That desire stays inmind, it arouses thousands of dreams which fill me with the desire to live, whichforce me to keep carrying the heavy burden... On the other hand, life in itself hasnothing left to offer me. When everything is finished, my desire will disappear aswell. What force will keep me yoked to life then?"And that's how it happened...And doubtless he didn't die with a curse on his lips, but rather with a cynical,philosophical smile of contempt for the world. A person like that dies in order tomock the world he lived in, to rob it of someone it desperately needs...How could it be otherwise?For years a person wanders from prison to prison, in Germany, Austria andprewar Poland; then he wanders from ghetto to ghetto; from one camp to another;always escapes the claws of death, and lives until he is freed at Buchenwald.And then, in liberated Buchenwald, this person who has so much to tell the worldjust rolls over and dies?His death was as solitary as that of his hundreds of thousands of comrades duringthe years of Nazi torture.* * *This is not simply an individual tragedy. He was about fifty. He had no family orfriends left. What could he expect from life? It is rather a tragedy for his people, whohad to stand by as its last intellectuals passed away, after they had been liberated.Those people were robbed of their most capable, creative members, and had to closetheir eyes while their last remaining potential was being destroyed, just beforespringtime...When I left for Paris, he felt only partially healthy. He was coming to psychologi-cally, and he was preparing for great literary and political projects. When we parted.121Chrzanowthinking was logical and consistent: If the Germans really wanted to exterminate us,then we would all be killed without distinction. He always remembered the parabletold by Rabbi Akiba to the modern, freethinking Papus ben Yehuda.He also encouraged his neighbors to maintain their Jewish optimism and stubborndefense of Judaism and tradition. When the bandits in police uniforms broke in,shouting, to the house of Reb Yitskhok Malts b/m, intending to cut off his beard, theseventy-year-old man heroically defended himself, refusing to permit them to cutoff the divine image.' They beat him brutally with an iron chain, but Reb Yitskhokhad his way.During the Passover seder my father and his neighbors felt like hidden Jews dur-ing the Spanish Inquisition. The doors were locked, the windows and cracks werestuffed, so that no light would reach outdoors and the modern-day Inquisitorswouldn't notice that Jews were behaving like princes. The passage "Pour out thywrath'' was pronounced with deep ecstasy and pain on those nights. The phrasefor they have consumed Jacob" was the occasion for rivers of tears. After the sederwas safely completed, everyone felt like a general who had just won a great battle.If on other holidays it was possible to hide inside and observe Judaism, the com-mandment to eat and sleep in a sukkah entailed great risks. In order to put up a suk-kah according to Jewish law, it was necessary to go out into the street or the court-yard. In this matter as well, my father pronounced his opinion, and the neighborsworked all day long the day before Sukkoth to build a proper sukkah.The first night, and all day long the first day of Sukkoth, everything went smoothly.Everyone was overjoyed at having been able to observe the commandment un-disturbed during those bitter times. In memory of the celebration of the drawing ofthe water at the Temple, they permitted themselves to sing in a hearty voice theseries of Psalms beginning with the words "a song of degrees." But Satan appeared,in the form of a German policeman. While walking down the street, he heard sing-ing; following the sound, he discovered the sukkah. Reb Moyshe and his neighbors,sitting in their shtreimelekh around the table laden with white challahs, became veryafraid, but they maintained their pride and equanimity. When the German askedwhat was going on the Jews explained that it was a certain Jewish holiday, duringwhich Jews had to be happy, sing, and even dance. The coarse German could barelyunderstand what it was about. After a long exchange (apparently he was one of thefew good Germans), he responded: "A remarkable nation, the Jews, and so un-cultured! If you're going to make a party, you should invite the women, and youshould dance together with them!"Unfortunately, this statement was soon to be realized. The same "cultured" Ger-man led my father and other Jews, along with their wives and daughters, to a devil'sdance at nearby Auschwitz.120Reb Moyshe BochnerA TEAR FOR MY FATHERMY FATHER fully believed that the evil reign would soon collapse. Although he wasclose to eighty years old, he never ceased looking forward to our chance to takerevenge on the nation of murderers.Although he sat and studied the Torah day and night, he took time out to listen topolitical news, and since he wasn't able to read newspapers himself in his advancedyears (he had grown blind from too much eyestrain), his children read various ar-ticles from the Nazi press to him. Remarkably, in every report from Hitler's highcommand he managed to find hints of defeat. He remained optimistic even whenHitler's armies had taken all of Europe. He cited a verse including the initial lettersto/, shin, and aleph to support his unshakable belief that Jews would be freed in theHebrew year designated by those three letters, and be able to raise their heads afterthe degradation and torture they had been forced to suffer at the hands of the Ger-mans.Once the German evildoers entered Chrzanow, my father didn't leave his house,since he was unwilling to risk sacrificing his beard. The murderers hunted throughall the Jewish houses and courtyards looking for a Jewish beard to cut off, and thussatisfy their sadistic lust. During the massive roundups carried out by the police andthe S.S., he was placed in bed. His beard was covered over, and we pretended thatthe person in the bed was extremely ill. This worked most of the time. Meanwhilemy father suffered greatly from his inability to spit in the faces of these devils, or atleast tell them the truth. Despite everything, my father was an optimist, and refusedto permit himself even to think of dying.He and the other residents of his building risked their lives, making a minyan topray daily as well as on the Sabbath, using a Torah scroll that had been rescued fromthe synagogue. The improvised synagogue in the apartment building was like abunker. During the services one of the neighbors would hang a sign outside, onwhich was written in German that the tenant of the apartment was at work, andwouldn't come home until evening.Thus prayer, Torah reading, and study of religious texts continued for severalyears. They even blew the shofar. On the Sabbath the congregation gathered,despite the watchful eyes of the Germans. Led by my father, they put on their Sab-bath clothes—their shtreimel and silk overcoats—and observed Judaism in the old-fashioned way. My father wasn't afraid of the evil regime, nor did he share theanxiety of the Jews, who quoted the saying, "Don't give Satan an opportunity." His119ChrzanowWeber. After Weber was sent to Auschwitz, the job was taken over by Zelig Gra-jower. Fasek Weber exploited his situation in base and brutal ways, growing rich onJewish trouble and pain. Zelig Grajower, on the other hand, carried out his work im-partially, helping the Jews in question whenever he could.The position of local magistrate was occupied by Dr. Kantner, a young Nazi whoutterly detested Jews. As early as 1939 he issued a regulation forbidding Jews fromwalking on the main street, Alea Henryka. The Judenrat had no access to Kantner.His representatives, on the other hand, were older and more experienced, and theyhad a better attitude toward Jewish affairs. These were Inspectors Lutherle andShorshek. The latter issued many passes for travel to Cracow, Berlin, and Moravia.The liaison between the Judenrat and the magistrate, Yosef Shonhertz, displayed agreat deal of concern for the needs of the Jews. In addition to Shonhertz, UsherFriedman was well acquainted with the magistrate's office and often used his con-nections to help the people of Chrzanow.The Kreisbauamt, led by the famous Kleinecke, was extremely important, and itsimportance grew daily, because it organized its own work camps in Libiaz, Bobrek,and Babice, all close to Chrzanow. Those sent to these work camps avoided the dan-gerous labor details, whose camps were located in Lower Silesia and central Ger-many. People were allowed to come home from Kleinecke's camps once a week, andsometimes more often. The Judenrat managed to establish close ties to Kleineckeand his staff, with Nagoshiner, who displayed deep understanding and empathy indealing with the problems of the Jews, as liaison.A significant role among the Nazi institutions was played by the Grund-stueckgesellschaft and the Treuhandstelle. The first of these institutions was respon-sible for assigning housing. Its importance grew when Jews were resettled from onepart of the city to another, and during the evacuation of the so-called Jewish quarter.The Judenrat liaison was Shmuel Kluger, a good and competent person.The Treuhandstelle, on the other hand, headed by the great anti-Semite Gupert,confiscated furniture and other valuable items found in Jewish houses. The tragicsituation was somewhat ameliorated by Kalmen Teichler, an Orthodox Jew whomanaged to establish contacts with this bureau, and who won Gupert s favor.Teichler did a great deal to help Jews, sitting at the Treuhandstelle for days on end,stubbornly fighting like a lion in defense of Jewish possessions.In these lines, I have provided a brief account of the activities and structure of theJudenrat. My goal was not to analyze the institution in depth. I have only mentionedimportant facts and certain individuals, who unquestionably operated with goodwill, and who more than once fell unwilling victim to the forces of barbarism.118The Year 1943duction. Nagoshiner, a great philanthropist and a warm-hearted person, did notlong survive as chairman of the judenrat. Thereafter he returned to his purelyeconomic responsibilities.After Cuker's arrest, the central office in Sosnowiec sent its directors to Chrzanow.For two months Yankel Ehrlich was in control in Chrzanow, until local conditionsdrove him away. As soon as he took over, the representatives of the Treuhandstelleand Grundstueckgesellschat threatened to resettle all the Jews of Chrzanow,because they were "spreading all sorts of infectious diseases." This worried Ehrlichgreatly. Since he was well connected with Merin, he managed to get himself re-assigned to his previous position in the finance department in Sosnowiec.He was followed by Moyshe Lefkowitz, the former chairman of the Judenrat inOlkusz and Zawiercie. Moyshe Lefkowitz became energetically involved in thereorganization of the community. But after a few months, he too resigned whenMerin accused him of profiting from the liquidation of goods belonging to those whowere deported.The last chairman of the Judenrat in Chrzanow was the well-known chairman ofthe community councils in Sosnowiec and Bendzin, Wladek Boehm. ApparentlyMerin wasn't very comfortable with Boehm's presence at the central office, and senthim to the difficult Chrzanow assignment in an attempt to get rid of him. In Chrzanowthe Kripo took a few dozen Jewish families every day. Although Boehm himself was avictim of Merin's machinations, he was altogether subservient to his boss in Sos-nowiec, viewing all local problems from the perspective of the central office.He grew anxious when he was unable to provide the proper number of womenand men for the labor details. At the same time, however, Boehm did the best hecould to support the Jews in Chrzanow, using his influence to increase the numberof shops and other workplaces. Boehm fully believed that getting Jews involved inproductive labor would enable him to preserve Chrzanow Jewry. His conviction wasstrengthened by the visit to Chrzanow of Commissar Dreher, who showed Boehm amap of the projected ghetto. All of these plans were pure fantasy. In February 1943all the Jews of Chrzanow were deported.THE JUDENRAT AND THE GERMAN AUTHORITIESContacts between the Judenrat and the local German officials were carried out onmore than the official level. The Judenrat had close relations with some of the Ger-man officials, thanks to various gifts and bribes. However, the Judenrat's closestcontacts were with the police, headed by Oberleutenant Schindler. An intelligentGerman, he understood thoroughly how to profit from the situation and received asteady income from the Judenrat, along with numerous gifts from dozens of Jewishfamilies in exchange for taking care of the most trivial matters. He was false throughand through, although he pretended to be a friend of the Jews. At the last, however,he showed his true colors.The liaison between the police and the Judenrat during the entire period was Fasek117ChrzanowReturning to the personnel of the Judenrat, it should be emphasized that the parti-cipation of well-known community activists, under the direction of Cuker, inspiredconfidence and trust among the Jews of Chrzanow. Cuker actually oversaw the evo-lution of work in several areas. He organized a network of social institutions, and didhis very best to ease the influence of the two low life scum, Weber and Wachsberg.Cuker, Nagoshiner, Teichler, Weiss, Shonhertz and others unquestionably hadmoral credit with the people of Chrzanow, and they enjoyed general respect untilthe Judenrat was burdened with responsibility for the labor details. The first laborrecruitment action was bitterly resented by the Jews of Chrzanow, because it wascarried out by the Judenrat. The central office of Silesian communities in Sosnowiecpromised that all of the local Judenrats would fully meet the quotas assigned them.From that moment on, the Judenrat was transformed into an object of hatred andcontempt, and all of its subsequent actions aroused fear and resentment.Cuker was an honest man, concerned for social well-being, and naturally in-telligent. A superficial evaluation of his activities could lead to the conclusion that hewas strict, cold, and hard as stone. But this conclusion was false, for Cuker possesseda warm heart. He believed in the Jewish nation and desired its well-being. Pained bythe suffering of the Jews, he expressed his pain more and more often. Moniek Merinimmediately sensed that Cuker wasn't his man, that he was too conscientious, tooresponsible. That was why he stopped confiding in Cuker.In light of these facts it is clear that all of the subsequent labor recruitment actionsand resettlements were organized and carried out by the central office in Sosnowiecand its delegates, with the assistance of trusted officials, who cooperated with thepolice in Bendzin and Sosnowiec.Cuker's end was tragic. Together with Nussbaum and Teichler, he was sent toAuschwitz by the Chrzanow police. A short time later came the news that all threehad died of heart failure. After Cuker's arrest, the books were checked by theGestapo men Kranuy and Freitag. This audit was undertaken because of severalanonymous letters, in which the Judenrat was accused of taking money in return forapartments, and also of slighting those resettled from Silesia. Although the auditrevealed no irregularities, Kranuy is said to have explained to Merin that accordingto the German authorities, Cuker had displayed too much nerve and independence.Teichler was freed and then immediately rearrested on the pretext that he had re-vealed secrets concerning the investigation to his colleagues and to the central office.There were rumors at the time that Merin was very interested in getting rid ofCuker, who had begun to resist the policies of the central office, which was actuallycarrying out the liquidation of the Jewish population of Silesia. It is an incontestablefact that after Cuker and his comrades were arrested, Merin still had a great deal ofinfluence with the Gestapo. However, he didn't make the least attempt to interveneon their behalf.Moyshe Nagoshiner worked closely with Cuker. He was responsible for thefinance department, and for some time was director of the housing commission.Later Nagoshiner took over the position of Judenrat chairman. After Cuker was ar-rested, he moved to the department that supervised Jewish trade and artisan pro-116The Year 1943population of Chrzanow, was extended. They included the following:— The free kitchen. Directed by Mrs. Korngold, the kitchen helped considerably toease the hunger of the Jewish masses in Chrzanow. The kitchen provided1,000 lunches every day. The citizens' kitchen was later set up by the Juden-rat, under the direction of Betsalel Cuker. This kitchen served middle classpersons who had been impoverished in the last years, and who were ashamedto ask for charity. The lunches served in the citizens' kitchen were tasty andinexpensive, but the small fee permitted those who frequented it to believethat they weren't "eating for free."— The clinic. The difficult material situation and the spread of malnutrition amongthe Jewish masses encouraged various diseases. Therefore an institution todistribute free medical assistance to the people was urgently needed. Theclinic was directed by a well-known doctor—first Dr. Riter, and later. Dr.Gutentag. The doctor was assisted by two paramedics and one nurse.— The children's home. This institution was created by the division of social assis-tance. Its activities sent wide ripples among the Jewish population.— The health bureau ran a laundry for the poorer population.— The children's and youth club. As a result of the Nazi occupation, it became impos-sible for the young people to continue their studies after September 1939. Theparents, who had to struggle for their very lives, simply could not devote anyattention to their children's education. The children's club, directed by ex-perienced teachers, filled the void created by the cataclysm.Under the direction of Bruche Wasserberger and Mrs. Weiss, the childrenspent nearly the entire day in a warm, pleasant atmosphere. In addition tothe youth club, the division for social assistance organized summer campsfor the older children. These camps were set up at the field belonging to BerlNeufeld, at No. 3 Fischer Street.— Trades courses. The trade and retraining schools for the older youth played an im-portant role. These courses were led by professionals, and were well attended.The following courses were exceptionally well taught: locksmithing and elec-tronics, under the direction of Engineer Fleissig; the beautician's course,directed by Sala Khon; sewing and tailoring, under the direction of RuthWeinreich; fashion, under the direction of Mrs. Norman.In addition to these practical courses, Hebrew, mathematics and physicswere also required. After these courses were completed, the students receiveddiplomas at special ceremonies organized by the Judenrat.The number of social institutions grew constantly. During the last phase of theliquidation of the Jewish community of Chrzanow, a hospital was set up under thedirection of the pharmacist Silberstein, and a post office under the direction ofSteinitz. There is no question that all these institutions fulfilled an important anduseful role under tragic circumstances, and that they significantly eased the difficultconditions for the Jewish masses.115ChrzanowWachsberg, showed off their ugly "glory." These were people with no sense ofJewish pride, without any communal responsibility. Only our tragic fate and thecursed new realities enabled them to assume power over Jewish society. The rest ofthe members were people of good will and decent intentions regarding the vital in-terests of the Jewish masses. However, they had no significant influence on the ac-tions of the Judenrat.The arrival in December 1939 of Chaim Merin was a major event in the history ofthe Chrzanow Judenrat. Chaim Merin presented himself as a delegate of the newdirector of the Silesia Judenrat, his brother Moniek Merin, whom Dreher, the chief ofthe Jewish department of the Gestapo, had assigned to set up a central Judenrat inEast Silesia.Chaim Merin conducted long presentations at the home of Zelig Grajower, inwhich he described the significance of this new institution, claiming that it woulddefend the interests of the Jews of Silesia. Merin emphasized in no uncertain termsthe necessity of coordinating the work of all of the communal bodies under the direc-tion of Moniek Merin, whose official title was ' 'Director of the Councils of Elders ofthe Jewish Religious Communities in East Silesia." Moniek Merin was to be the of-ficial representative of all the Judenrats in Silesia, and all the chairmen of theJudenrats were to fulfill obediently the commands and regulations he issued.Merin's entire presentation aroused considerable dissatisfaction among themembers of the Judenrat. Fasek Weber and David Wachsberg, for whom Merin's in-volvement was inconvenient, tried to prevent the reorganization of the Judenrat,and its subordination to the central Judenrat in Sosnowiec. Chaim Merin, mean-while, referred to his own Zionist activism and his socially responsible, nationalisticapproach to every problem. Meanwhile, he insisted that in reorganizing theJudenrat he would rely on the support of serious, respected people with a record offruitful social work on behalf of the Jews of Chrzanow. Nevertheless Merin's plansdid not touch a sympathetic chord among the members of the Judenrat.However, after long negotiations, explanations, and threats, Chaim Merin managedto reorganize the Judenrat entirely and to bring in new, competent, and honest peo-ple. Among them were well-known Zionist activists such as Betsalel Cuker, MoysheNagoshiner, Mendl Nussbaum, Kalmen Teichler, and Shmuel Yosef Weiss. After theredistribution of tasks, the constitution of the Judenrat was as follows:Yosef Umlauf—chairman (a nominal position); Betsalel Cuker—chairman (withactual control); Moyshe Nagoshiner—first vice-chairman and director of the financedepartment; Kalmen Teichler—second vice-chairman and director of socialassistance; Zelig Grajower—director of the winter action and aid to children;Shmuel Kluger—director of the housing department; Mendl Nussbaum—directorof supplies and trade; Yoysef Shonhertz—the health bureau; Shmuel Weiss—direc-tor of the social institutions of the Judenrat; David Wachsberg—the labor bureau;Dr. Werner—office manager; and Fasek Weber—police liaison.With this setup, the Judenrat organized a new office and a complete staff ofemployees. The network of social institutions, of unquestioned importance for the114The Year 1943graph, with Schindler at the center, was seen in 1944 at a work camp by a Jewish girlfrom Chrzanow named Fela Scharf. It was in the hands of a German policeman fromBerlin who had been present during this incident. The picture is captioned,"Chrzanow is finally Judenrein."Mgr. Yakov SilfenA Word About the Council of EldersWhen we first saw the Nazi bandits on the streets of Chrzanow, our hearts werefilled with indescribable and infinite sorrow. We instinctively sensed that the mostdreadful period in our recent history was coming, a period of total annihilation ofJewish society.Where could we escape, where could we lay our weary bodies and our torturedsouls?Everyone sought an answer to this question. Jews from cities and towns burrowedinto caves, holes, and bunkers, seeking protection against the barbaric enemy. Ourblood froze in our veins when we heard the tragic news arriving from all sides. InMielec Jews were being burned, in Trzebinia they were being shot, around us thebrutal terror of animal sadism reigned. In this situation the words of the Polish poetMickiewicz's Dziady came to life: "Darkness and silence everywhere; What will be?,what will be?."The concept of a body of Jewish representatives was alien to the Jewish masses.Thus it was with a certain astonishment that the Jews heard the news that a Jewishcommittee would be established to represent Jewish concerns in dealings with theGerman authorities.Jews who were influenced by the tragic news about the barbaric oppression of theJews in Germany couldn't comprehend the fact that an institution had been calledinto being to serve the interests of the Jewish masses. We must acknowledge that themasses always have clear instincts, and sense the approach of great events.The first Jewish committee, whose official name later resounded as " Aeltestenratder Jiidische Kultursgemeinde," consisted of the following individuals: chairmanYosef Umlauf; vice chairmen, Shmuel Kluger and David Wachsberg (Bishte); LevyKrauskopf, and Menachem Unger. After the committee had been in existence for afew weeks, Zelig Grajower, Dr. Riter, and Dr. Werner were coopted as well.The work of the first committee was quite chaotic during the first weeks. The func-tions of the various members had not yet been defined, and the office wasn'torganized. The only activities were the requisitioning of furniture by Wachsberg(Bishte) and Fasek Weber, and the assignment of Jews to forced labor in theframework of the German contingent.The first positive step taken by the committee was the organization of a popularkitchen, which saved a large number of the poorest members of the population fromcertain starvation.Among all the members of the Judenrat only two, Fasek Weber and Bishte113ChrzanowSince the last resettlement came so unexpectedly—since the Jews of Chrzanowbelieved that this time, as before, only some Jews would be sent away, and the restwould be able to stay—we became confused. During the selections at the Chrzanowmarket place, when the Germans sent one Jew to the right and the other to the left, anumber of people stole across to the other side, thinking they were joining the groupthat would stay in the city. But they were fatally mistaken. Many young people who,as it later turned out, were intended for the work camps where they had at least aminimal chance of surviving, thus fell among those intended for the gas chambers.The terrible scene at the market place, when people finally realized what was hap-pening, is difficult to convey in words. With a cold shudder one remembers takingleave of sorrowing mothers, who had been selected to go to the work camps but ranvoluntarily to the other side to be with their children, thus earning themselves blowsat the murderers' hands.All the Jews, those intended for the gas chambers and those to be sent to the workcamps, were taken to the gymnasium building. Two transports left from that place:one to Auschwitz, the second to the infamous Jewish work camp at Markshtet. TheGermans left the members of the Judenrat in the city for a few more days, so that theremaining Jewish institutions could be liquidated. Then they were sent to Sos-nowiec to stay in the ghetto there.The tragic fate of Moyshe Nagoshiner, which demonstrates the unreliability of theGermans, is worth describing.Among those included in the transport sent to Auschwitz was the Zionist activistYosef Hochbaum, who was a member of the Judenrat and director of finances duringthe final period, and his family. Moyshe Nagoshiner intervened with the Gestapochief, who stopped next to the train carrying the unfortunate Jews, and asked him torelease Hochbaum, whose services were needed in connection with the liquidationof the finances. The Gestapo chief calmly listened to Nagoshiner and agreed to hissuggestion, ordering Nagoshiner to enter the train to find Hochbaum among thecrowd of Jews. Nagoshiner naively believed that he had saved Yosef Hochbaum. Butjust when Nagoshiner entered the railroad car, the Gestapo chief ordered that thedoors be sealed, and the train started off with Nagoshiner inside, while the Gestapochief laughed demonically.On that day Chrzanow became officially Judenrein, although a certain number ofJews remained in hiding, as we mentioned at the beginning. The Germans them-selves found a few of these hidden Jews, aided by traitorous Poles. Some voluntarilyleft their lairs, believing the German assurances that they would be released. Severaldays later all of these Jews were taken to Sosnowiec, where a selection was made atthe local transit camp.Finally an incident should be mentioned which the survivors from Chrzanow maynot know of. There are Jews from Chrzanow who still believe that Schindler was afriend of the Jews. After the police, led by their commander Schindler, had com-pleted the final annihilation of Chrzanow Jews, they had themselves photographedat the Chrzanow market place, their faces beaming with pleasure. This group photo-112The Year 1943AFTER 1942, the year of greatest suffering for the Jews of Chrzanow, a degree of calmsettled in early in 1943. This doesn't mean that there was total quiet, but there wereno mass actions, although the daily Kripo actions continued. Two higher func-tionaries of the criminal police, Latz and Westphal, were especially diligent in carry-ing out these actions. They harassed their victims with special sadism, shadowingparticular individuals in order to catch them committing some infraction. In mostcases, these murderers were successful. They didn't spare even their closest Jewishacquaintances, from whom they used to take bribes. (These two murderers wererecognized by Chrzanow Jews in 1948 and handed over to justice. They received afitting sentence from a Polish court.) In general, apathy was the norm among theJews of Chrzanow during the last period before the final liquidation. Like a herdwithout a will of their own they marched along, thinking of nothing. All of theirenergies were devoted to work in the shop, and the other public enterprises stillfunctioning under Kleinecke.Absurd as it may seem, the distribution of rations to the Jewish population im-proved significantly at the very end, when Jews received rations equal to those of thenon-Jewish population. This in itself led to a certain degree of optimistic faith thatthose surviving would be left alone. This optimism was apparently the goal of theGermans in those last hours of our people's death agony. It helped assure that theGerman extermination plan would be successful. This apathetic optimism, in ouropinion, virtually sealed the fate of the 3,000 Jews remaining in Chrzanow, and theleaders of the last Judenrat bore considerable responsibility for the way things turnedout.Before dawn on Thursday, February 18, 1943, the Germans sealed the city anddrove all the Jews into the marketplace. Just as professional slave traders came alongwith the Romans during the destruction of Jerusalem, so too Lindner and his staffcame to the last action in Chrzanow. They selected the younger and stronger Jews towork as slaves in the German labor camps. (While these lines were being written,the news came that Lindner had been arrested in Hamburg. Not only did he fail toexpress any remorse to the British military court; on the contrary, he mourned thathe had killed so few Jews... One hour before his trial, he hung himself in his prisoncell.) As tragic as it may seem, during this last resettlement Lindner had competi-tion. The Gestapo came as well, in order to secure as many Jews as possible for thegas chambers in Auschwitz. There was very nearly a struggle between the Gestapoand Lindner's staff—each wanted as large a contingent as possible.IllChrzanowThe directors of the shop were Shimon Orenstein and Rosenberg, who weredeliberately and suddenly taken to the Hell of Auschwitz as soon as the shop began tooperate. This detail is worth discussing because one theory, which cannot be verifiedtoday, holds that this case was analogous to the case of Betsalel Cuker. The centralJudenrat in Sosnowiec wanted to keep the majority of the meager wages sent for theworkers in the shop. The two directors forcefully resisted this move, unwilling to ac-cede to this sort of treatment of the workers. Sosnowiec did not easily suffer subor-dinates who had their own opinions, and considered this behavior to be a rebellionagainst its rule. It swept the two men away with the back of its hand. Nor can it beoverlooked that the murder of Orenstein and Rosenberg was intended to terrify theshop workers into behaving properly, a method that had been used successfully bythe Germans before.The shop continued to function until the resettlement, when the workers weretaken from their sewing machines and presses to the assembly points, some to workcamps and some to the ovens.110The Year 1942Chrzanow placed so much hope—the shop. This was a business set up to employtailors and others in manufacturing uniforms for the Germans.At the time the shop worked its way into our bones, like a leech sucking out ourmarrow and blood, its victims including the women and minor children who re-mained. The shop was supposed to be for our own good, and that was what webelieved in the period just before the final liquidation. Although the shop was like athin straw, which a drowning man grabs in the belief that it's a raft, we soon realizedthat the special work certificates were no good. The belief that working for Kleineckewould be the salvation of the jews burst like a bubble. Everything we touchedsmacked of death. Thus it is hardly surprising that all the Jews who remained inChrzanow had no choice but to try to get into the shop, which was nothing but aFata Morgana, an illusion which deceived, or more accurately, blinded us.The attraction of the shop lay, as Jews like to say, in its rationality. The Germanswere at war; they needed clothes for their army. At their disposal was a largenumber of skilled tailors, who were eager to work, as long as they could remainalive. The S.S. took most of the wages. The administration cost almost nothing,because it was in the hands of the Judenrat. The work was done quickly and ac-curately. The conclusion was that the Jews were needed to work in the. shop,because otherwise the Germans would have no uniforms.Actually there were two shops. One was a branch of the Trzebinia rubber factory;the other was a branch of the Berlin firm of Rosner, whose main shop was in Bendzin.The shop—generally referred to in the singular—was located in the building of theStudy society, which was most appropriate for this purpose. The adjoining build-ings of the Talmud Torah, the old age home, and the synagogues of the Radomskand Bobow Chasidim were also used. Just as in Pharaoh's time, the Germans didn'tprovide straw for the bricks the Jews had to make. The necessary sewing machinesand all the other equipment had to be provided by the Judenrat. All of the Jewishsewing machines in the city were requisitioned, or else the Jews who wanted towork in the shop had to bring their own sewing machines. About 1,500 Jews workedround the clock in three shifts—men, women, and children. The pay was minimal,the work difficult and responsible. The workers were divided into groups, eachsupervised by a skilled tailor who was responsible for seeing that the work was car-ried out perfectly, with exemplary order and strict, almost military discipline. TheJews had to work on the Sabbath and the holidays, including Rosh Hashanah andYom Kippur.All of Jewish communal life during the last period (roughly from July 1942 untilFebruary 1943) was reflected at the shop. Joy and sorrow, trouble and pleasure filledthe buildings. One Jew would speak from the bottom of his heart; a second told anew joke, or sang a new song. Their common fate erased the differences betweenthe aristocracy and the common people, between the erstwhile rich man and thepauper. People sensed instinctively that their lives hung by a thread, and they en-joyed themselves with a kind of gallows humor for as long as they could. Theylaughed and joked at their home troubles as no other people could possibly havedone.109Chrzanowsuch as Reb Nute the Judge, Reb Chiel Perlstein, and Reb Moyshe Lipschitz (an inde-fatigable philanthropist during the occupation)—in a word, the cream of ChrzanowJewry—were locked up in the elementary school and synagogues. From there theywere transported to nearby Auschwitz.As we have said, a large number of Jews had special certificates, or worked atvarious kinds of hard labor. Although the certificates were no longer as effective asthey had once been, since a large number of their bearers had been taken to the workcamps in March, nevertheless several certificate holders continued to work atvarious sorts of public employment, organized by the labor inspector Kleinecke.This German may have been well-intentioned, thinking that the Jews who workedfor him would never be sent away. He also did everything he could to involve Jewsin vital industries, and assured all the Jews working for him that there was no dangerof their being taken to the camps. But in June 1942 all the Jews working for Kleineckewere ordered to go to the camps. They weren't even given time to bring along theirmost necessary possessions; rather, all of these "secure” workers were transportedstraight from work to the camps. Once again, the Jews had a chance to evaluate Ger-man assurances.The troubles suffered by the Jews of Chrzanow in 1942 can barely be described inwords. As was the case with Job, the troubles came one after the other in quick suc-cession. Before the Jews could catch their breath, another form of torture would ap-pear. They didn't have time to think about their desperate situation. The Germanrace to murder all the Jews as fast as possible took on such terrible forms that theJews almost stopped noticing the individual victims who suffered at the hands of theKripo or the Gestapo.Individual Jews, and then eventually entire families, were constantly sent to theHell of Auschwitz on various ludicrous pretexts. A typical case of German behaviorwas the deportation to Auschwitz of David Wachsberg (Bishte) and Fasek Weber, twocharacters about whom the Germans had no reason to complain. It was impossibleto find out why they had been fired; however, the speculation was that these two,who were also members of the Judenrat, knew too many police secrets, and thepolice apparently wanted to destroy the vessels it had used for its evil goals.The 3,000 Jews the Germans had just taken away weren't enough for them. TheMoloch of Auschwitz constantly demanded new victims to test the newly-installedgas chambers and crematoria. Thus it was that at the end of July, or the beginning ofAugust, the police announced that all Jews still remaining in Chrzanow were toreport to a certain area, where their papers would be stamped. This was supposedlya census, enabling the authorities to determine exactly how many Jews were still inChrzanow (such were the reassurances of Merin). While the papers were beingstamped, the Germans surrounded the area and the same "game" was repeated.Several hundred more Jews were seized and sent down to Sheol.THE SHOPWe need to devote a separate section to the institution in which the Jews of108The Year 1942And now to the exact description of the events before the killing of the sevenKedoshim (martyrs) of b/m on April 29,1942. On April 22 German police escorted byGestapo broke in and arrested all the men who were present in my father's house,without a word of explanation. The next morning my sister Frumka found out thatthey were found guilty of violating a German ban not to start up bakery furnaces.My father had two bakeries: one for the baking of bread during the whole year, thesecond only for baking of Mazot for Pesach (Passover) at Bolinska st. 2.In 1941 the Germans gave an order to my father not to bake bread in the bakery butthey allowed him to use the Mazot bakery for preheating food for the Sabat. A Polishneighbor saw the smoke and immediately informed the German police.In April 1942 the Germans decided to begin the final liquidation of the Jews ofChrzanow. Therefore, in order to frighten us, they were looking for scapegoats. Allthe Jews who were at that time in jail had been executed by hanging and so it hap-pened that my father and my two brothers were among the seven who died that day.My brother Chaim was 39 at his death. He lived in Auschwitz before the war wherehe had his own bakery. He had three children. Men who were present at the execu-tion told me that he wanted to split the chains and attack the murderers, but myfather didn't allow him, saying: "There are still Jews left in Chrzanow, the Germanswill take revenge." Then he stepped on the scaffold and shouted: "Jews takerevenge for our blood," and he gave his soul with Shema Israel on his lips.My brother Shimshon was 37 at his death. He was a quiet and melancholy man. Hereceived his fate quietly, saying, "What is written (preordained) above will happendown here, it is impossible to change anything." And so he stepped up to the scaf-fold without a word. At the murder of the seven martyrs, about 900 people were pres-ent. The police had taken away their identity cards a day before the execution. Toreclaim them they were compelled to be present at the execution. One of them was myyoungest sister Frumka. The poor girl was forced to look all the time at the horror. Aplainclothed Gestapo man stood at her side and made sure that her eyes were turnedin the direction of the trees, where the hanging took place.Menachem GerstnerBat-Yam Israel 1988The hanging of the seven Jews was a signal for the commencement of the plannedliquidation of the Jews of Chrzanow. On May 30, all the Jews of Chrzanow had toreport to one of several designated places. This action was given the innocent name of"resettlement," and at that time we didn't know exactly what the term implied. TheGermans ordered everyone to bring along a few personal possessions. The directorof the central Judenrat in Sosnowiec, Moniek Merin, came, along with his secretary,Mrs. Czarny. Accompanied by Gestapo personnel, they carried out the selection,determining who was to live and who was to die. The Jews were lined up in rowsand divided into three groups. The first group was to remain. The second group wasto be sent to the camps. The third group, including the elderly and the sick, was to be"resettled." Roughly 3,000 Chrzanow Jews, including the most respected elders107ChrzanowFayvl Weissberger (Fayvl Yoshes) was found in possession of a bit of coffee. YehoshuaSpangelet "illegally" possessed a few onions and parsley. Yisroel Frish, an honestmerchant, was taken to prison because he was accused by a German. The seventhvictim was a Jew from Olkusz, who had been found in possession of a piece ofsausage. All of these "criminals" were sentenced to hang. In mid-May 1942, theJudenrat was ordered to make all the Jews come see their own brothers being hung.To be sure that the Jews would come, a large number of them had their personaldocuments taken away. They were told these would be returned only at thespecially-arranged "Hanging Place" on Krzyska Street.The Germans prepared for this performance with pomp and circumstance. Atruck carrying a megaphone was driven back and forth through town, announcingjoyfully and triumphantly, "Today seven Jews will be hung, a hundred tomorrow,and the day after tomorrow all the Jews." All of the uniformed Germans came intheir finest uniforms; German civilians came in their holiday clothes, with theirwives and girlfriends. Seven half-dead Jews were brought to the "Hanging Place."They had been shaved, and their necks exposed. They could barely stand up. Sevenhangmen brought in for the occasion, along with their seven assistants, carried outthe horrifying murder. The nooses were strung from seven old trees. Fasek Weberhad to test the tree limbs to see whether they were strong enough.For more than two hours, which seemed like an eternity, the assembled Jews hadto stand at the "Hanging Place" and watch as their unfortunate martyred brothersdied. Each and every one shouted out a terrifying "Shema Yisroel!” as the noosewas placed over his neck. One of the martyrs managed to cry out a plea for revengeon the murderers. Following is an eyewitness statement by the surviving son andbrother Menachem Gerstner of Bat Yam Israel.STATEMENTI, Menachem Gerstner (Mendek), born in 1924, want to bring to your attentiondetails about the murders of my father and my two brothers, Chaim and Shimshon,who weren't known to Mr. Bochner, the writer of the original book of Chrzanow. Myfather was an honorable citizen of Chrzanow. He was a Talmud chuchim (Torahscholar); a man known in town for his Matn Zduku beseiser (generosity); he was aZaloshitzer Chasid; he prayed in the Chevra-Kvaitim; he fasted twice a week (everySheinivechamishi). In spite of all this he was very liberal. For example, I had veryreligious brothers and sisters, but also brothers who were Socialists. One bramkarz(played catcher) in the Jutchnia team in Chrzanow and also served in the Polisharmy. My sister Zipora married Shlomo Lauber and went to Palestine in 1932.I also had a brother-in-law, Cyna Horowitz, who served in the city administrationas delegate of P.P.S. (Poland's Socialist Party).My father had a large family, with 13 children. My mother Sara (Schehnberg of thefamous Kamienica) died at a young age in 1932 and left nine children, none married.My father was known in Chrzanow as der Chrzanover Baker or Reb Sruel der Beker. Hewas 69 at the day of his death.106The Year 1942afraid of Cuker, who was more intelligent than he was, and painful though it may beto acknowledge, he brought about Cuker's downfall.Without any investigation or discussion, Cuker, Nussbaum, and Teichler weretaken to the police station, murderously beaten, and sent to Auschwitz. Several dayslater telegrams were sent by the Auschwitz camp administration to their families, an-nouncing the death of their husbands and fathers, even listing a "disease" fromwhich they had died.This serious blow, which had in fact been carefully calculated, was felt by the en-tire population of Chrzanow. The police later related that when Betsalel Cuker wastaken to the Gestapo chief, the latter had said: "Now we finally have the proud andcold Cuker in our hands!"During the first days of March, the entire Jewish ghetto was surrounded by policeand S.S. men, who set about inspecting the Jewish houses to determine whether theJews had handed over everything demanded. Anyone found to possess any furs—no matter whether it was an old worn-out coat, or even a child's fur coat—was takento the police, where they were detained and beaten brutally. In the beginning wedidn't think much of this, and it seemed that the people who were taken in wouldquickly be released. However, when the Germans had detained ten people, these in-nocent souls were sent to Auschwitz. Among those detained were the long-timemember of the Chrzanow city council, Reb Chaim Richter m/b/a, and the well-knownWIZO activist, Mrs. Korngold m/b/a.In order to fill the cup of sorrow, on March 11 came a visit from Major Lindner.Once again Chrzanow was surrounded. Jews were dragged out of bed. The angelsfrom Hell took anyone they could catch, those with certificates and those without,several hundred men, women, and children in all. They were taken to various workcamps, where most of them died.With the liquidation of Betsalel Cuker, whom the more perceptive Jews recognizedas a defender against internal and external enemies, there arose a gap in theJudenrat—a gap that could not be filled. The Judenrat had no direction. Chaos reigned,just as the Germans intended, because by that time the plan for complete annihi-lation had already been worked out. It wasn't convenient for the Germans to have todeal with conscious, proud Jews like Betsalel Cuker.In the meantime Merin sent Dr. Boehm to Chrzanow to serve as commissar, repre-senting Merin as leader of the Judenrat. At the end of April, in addition to the contin-uing individual Kripo (Gestapo) cases, the Germans hung seven Jewish martyrs inChrzanow, in a gruesome spectacle. Apparently this was the signal for the completeliquidation of Chrzanow Jews. These actions were intended to terrify the Jews andthrow them into panic, to break their courage to resist their tormenters.There was no shortage of victims for this tragic game, because the police prisonwas always occupied by several Jews. Those who were to be hung were chosen fromthe interned. The identity of the victims was not important. At that time an old bakernamed Reb Yisroel Gershtner and his two sons were accused by a Polish chimneysweep. He said that he had seen smoke coming out of their chimney at a time whenthey were forbidden to bake, and they were taken to prison. Another Jew named105The Year 1942DURING THIS YEAR, torture and pain fell on the Jews of Chrzanow like a flow ofmolten lava. No one was surprised any longer by the constant issuance of newregulations. Unfortunately, their fate had already been sealed. By now they weren'tstruggling for personal freedom, but rather for their very lives.In January 1942 the Gestapo ordered the Jews to surrender all of their gold, furs,and better clothing. (Actually Jews had long since been forbidden to own any gold.)All of this was to be delivered to the Judenrat, whose task was to hand it over to theGermans. The Gestapo told the Judenrat that the more the Jews delivered, the betterimpression the Jews of Chrzanow would make on the German authorities.The Judenrat devoted all its energies to making sure that as much as possible washanded over, especially furs and woolens, which the Germans so desperately neededfor their armies in Russia. With nearly all the Jews contributing to this collection, theJudenrat actually turned over a substantial quantity of gold, furs, and woolens,which the Germans accepted with their familiar poisonous smiles. It seemed thatthese "sacrifices" satisfied those to whom they were given.Another incident took place almost at the same time, but with even more fatal con-sequences for Chrzanow. As already mentioned, the Judenrat controlled an economicdepartment, which supervised food warehouses for the needs of the Jewish popula-tion. In one of these warehouses turnips (klokes) were stored, and they began to spoilbecause of a lack of light. The Germans exploited this accident as an excuse for amurderous action against the Judenrat itself, with the chairman Betsalel Cuker, thedirector of the economic bureau Mendl Nussbaum, and Kalmen Teichler, both mem-bers of the Judenrat, as their main targets. These men, who acted as responsibleJews and members of the community, were accused of nothing less than sabotageagainst the Germans. It was already known in the city that the Gestapo was keepingits eye on Betsalel Cuker, whose proud and courageous statements had "mocked"the Gestapo officers Kranuy and Freitag. In Cuker's dealings with these beasts, heneither bent over backwards nor smiled submissively, as most Jews did at that timewhen talking to German officials. For this reason, he also was disliked by his directorMoniek Merin, who was a spiritually crippled Diaspora Jew despite all his talents.Apparently Cuker, who had a realistic and far-reaching perspective on the Jewishsituation, made Merin uncomfortable. Cuker clearly saw what was going on aroundhim, and he clearly comprehended the tragic situation the Jews were in.Several days before his gruesome death, he expressed himself accurately to hisclosest colleagues in the Judenrat. He said that in the last analysis the Judenrat wasnothing less than an agent of the Gestapo, and the chairman of the Judenrat, willinglyor unwillingly, was guilty of the murder of his fellow Jews. The devilish Merin grew104The Year 1941guest appearance, on the pretext of checking trivial infractions. Not one of thosewho was detained even dreamed what was coming. Without trial, they were sent toAuschwitz; we didn't really know what that meant yet. Among these victims of Ger-man “justice" were the wife of Moyshe Richter, a mother of four children, who hadbought a chicken from a Gentile woman; Mrs. Guter, guilty of the same sin; Mrs.Taybl Cyzner, who had sold a few pennies' worth of candy to a Gentile in her ownstore; and many similar cases.The practice of sending people to Auschwitz for individual infractions continuedfrom May 30, 1942 until February 18,1943. In general these actions were called Kripoactions (an acronym for “kriminal police"). This threat hung like a sword ofDamocles over the heads of the Jews of Chrzanow throughout the last year beforethe death of the community.It is interesting to analyze the handling of the various "crimes" committed byChrzanow Jews during that period. In order to avoid starving, certain individualsdealt in currency and gold. These merchants were even able to buy passes from theGermans permitting them to travel to Berlin and back, and managed to completevarious transactions involving currency. Anyone caught committing this category ofinfraction was tried in a court at Myslowice or Katowice. The accused was allowed tobe represented by a defense lawyer, and the court proceedings were conducted nor-mally. If convicted, the accused was sentenced to several months in prison andmoney seized in his possession was confiscated. On the other hand, the "crime" ofbuying an egg for a sick person or a child carried the sentence of certain death inAuschwitz.This relationship between the sentences for different categories of crime couldhave existed only under the Germans. Their goal was to extort from the Jews theirhidden valuables—money, jewelry, securities, and the like. The German financeminister Viltshok, a frequent guest in Chrzanow, was well informed about all of thesedealings. He had at his disposition a staff of Jewish traitors from Upper Silesia,the likes of Laderer and others. The merchants fell into the well-laid trap, dragging asecond and a third in with them. Even after all the Jews of Chrzanow were "liqui-dated," the Germans didn't desist from finding more Jewish treasure bricked up inthe walls of houses, or buried underground.103Chrzanowand Pipek's Alley [Gamcarska]), where it remained until the final catastrophe.Even more than before, Jews were forced to go to work each day. Even on the Sab-bath and on Jewish holidays they had to serve the police and S.S. troops, polishingtheir shoes, washing the floors, cleaning the outhouses, and the like. Furthermore,the Jews had to provide a few dozen men each day for work in town—cleaningstreets, clearing snow, and so forth.Meat, eggs, butter, and milk were forbidden to Jews, even though they wereavailable in sufficient quantities. German policemen went from house to house in-specting the pots to make sure they contained nothing forbidden. Our hearts nearlyfailed when we heard the tramp of police boots. Many of our women and childrenactually did succumb to heart attacks caused by terror, a long time before they weresuffocated and burned in Auschwitz.Lindner never stopped arranging work details during that period. He continued todemand (or better, to grab) new victims for the German labor camps. After a timeonly girls were taken, because the young men of Chrzanow didn't allow themselvesto be taken so easily. The frequent roundups by the German police often failed tobring the desired results, because the intended victims often reached their hidingplaces. The inventiveness of these people, who wanted to survive to take vengeanceon our torturers, was astonishing—the Germans rarely came across their cleverlyconstructed hiding places. Lindner and his Jewish helper Moniek Merin understoodthis, and therefore recruited the Jewish militia to help them carry out the last laboraction. They didn't even rely solely on the local Jewish militia from Chrzanow, in-stead bringing along some Jewish police from Sosnowiec for the purpose. InNovember 1941 a detachment from Sosnowiec arrived, and with true devotion to theGerman hangmen, they carried out their vile task. Although officially only thosegirls who had been assigned by the Judenrat to be taken to the labor camp were to beseized, the roundup by the Sosnowiec police turned into a general hunt for youngwomen. The Sosnowiec militia, or "Merin's Bodyguards" as they were called, werethe equal of their German supervisors in many respects. Without second thoughts,with cynical cruelty, nearly all of them burst into Jewish homes, searching for ter-rified Jewish girls, dragging them out of their hiding places, and taking them toSosnowiec and thence to the local transit camp. Afterward the young women, alongwith similar victims from other towns, were transported to various labor camps.At the same time the discriminatory regulations against Jews were increased. TheGerman police, headed by Schindler, began checking for the most trivial "sins,"such as buying an egg or a chicken from a peasant woman, or selling something for-bidden to a Gentile. The police filled out reports and punished the "guilty" with asmall fine. We thought that these trivial infractions had been forgotten, but a fewdays or weeks later the police turned their attention to these people again. Theresults of this attention were quite unfortunate. Those who had committed the in-fractions received notices to report to the police on a certain date in connection withtheir "crimes." It wasn't until they got to the police station that the people realizedthe trap they'd fallen into. The Gestapo from Katowice had come to Chrzanow for a102The Year 1941somewhat eased the pain of the families whose loved ones had been torn away.As we have said, the Judenrat maintained a precise list of able-bodied Jews. Dur-ing the roundup on May 9, several hundred Jews managed to reach their hidingplaces and avoid the "main event." Lindner recorded these names, and summonedthem on May 25. Once again a number of victims were taken to the labor camps, thistime including several young women.The establishment of a Jewish militia must also be mentioned in connection withthe labor details. Actually this was a police detail under the command of FasekWeber. They had all the trappings of a police force: blue and white caps, special in-signia, fixed working hours, and so forth. These police regulated traffic in the Jewishstreets, made sure that the houses were clean and orderly, and carried out variousmissions for the Judenrat. In a word, it was an authority that could not be ignored,because the Germans stood right behind them. In the beginning the police appearedto be practical and necessary, but unfortunately they later brought us endlesstroubles.The first appearance of the Jewish police elicited a good deal of envy on the part ofthe Poles, although they had absolutely no authority over the Poles. The Poleswatched, furious and dreaming of revenge, as the Jewish policemen controlled auto-mobile traffic at the city's major intersections. In general there were no Polish policein Chrzanow during the war, because the city was 80% Jewish. Sometimes—when no Germans were around—the city seemed like an autonomous Jewish state.But there were tragic scenes whenever a labor detail was mustered—scenes thatrevealed the full absurdity of this degenerate institution which the Germans in-vented as part of our annihilation.The German attack on Russia didn't surprise the Jews of Chrzanow at all. Severalmonths earlier they had seen the massive advance of German forces toward theSoviet border. Webs of hope were spun in the hearts of many Jews. Who knew?Perhaps there would be a German defeat, and the Russians would liberate us. Onthe other hand, if, God forbid, the Germans won, perhaps they would ease theirmurderous pogrom, at least for a short time, just as they had a year earlier during thevictories over France and Belgium.Unfortunately, the outbreak of war with Russia brought a change for the worse. Inaddition to the bad news coming from the rest of Poland—the mass slaughters inLemberg, Stanislaw, Tarnow—in Chrzanow, too, we could begin to smell the scentof gas. As in a speeded-up movie, the Germans began to realize their dark plans.They were desperately eager; they hurried to carry out their mass slaughters as fastas possible. Regulations fell on us like hail, regulations with only one aim: to worsenthe situation of the Jews and to drive them together in a crowded ghetto.In the fall of 1941, the ghetto became much more crowded and shrunken. Mickie-wicz Street, Cracow Street, and the marketplace, where the majority of the Jewslived, became Judenrein. The Jews were left with only the small, narrow back streetsaround the marketplace, along with Krzyska Street and Kadlubek. The communitycouncil was moved to Reb Yakov Lemler's house (on the corner of Cracow Street101Chrzanowtogether with his students and congregants, and had fun with the beards and peyesof the terrified Jews. Later they dragged the same Jews outside of the city, wherethey were murderously beaten and forced to do heavy work on the Jewish holiday.This "performance,” Schindler later claimed, had been organized to satiate the S.S.officer's lust for a bit of anti-Jewish sadism.MAJOR LINDNERThis name by itself was enough to inspire terror and panic among all the Jews ofthe Reich who had been included in the administrative region of Sosnowiec, underthe bureau of labor assignments. Lindner headed this bureau. He was a wild animalin human form, a cold sadist and an enemy of humanity whom even the Germansfeared. Major Lindner wasn t new to Chrzanow; he was a frequent if unwelcomeguest, whose regular visits cast a pall of terror over all the Jews, without exception.The first to meet this human animal were the young men of Chrzanow who weretaken away in the first transports to the Upper Silesian camps of Sakrau andGogolin. When Lindner went to inspect the camps, he sent some twenty of theyoung men to Auschwitz on ridiculous pretexts. Apparently these victims wereamong the first to die in that gruesome Gehenna. The bitter reports received fromthe work camps terrified the relatives and parents of the laborers, and at that timeLindner would come seeking new victims. The Germans apparently understoodthat Merin's fine speeches would no longer convince the Jews to respond voluntarilyto the Judenrat's call, as they once had.Before dawn on May 9,1941 the Germans surrounded the entire city. No one waspermitted to enter or leave. They sealed the streets, and like wild beasts they attackedthe houses. They dragged the sleeping Jews, especially able-bodied men, out of theirhouses. In those families where the men managed to disappear into hiding places,the Germans took women hostage.The Jews were taken off in groups to the assembly area in front of the gymnasium,and then lined up according to the Prussian military drill system. None other thanthe anti-Semite Lindner and his staff officers Knol and Kutshinsky came out toreceive them. (After the Liberation the latter was spotted by Jews from Chrzanow inWeiden, Bavaria, in the innocent role of a teacher in a German high school. ThePolish authorities demanded his extradition, and in October, 1948 he was sentencedto death by the Polish court in Sosnowiec.) After the sonders were checked, all ofthose who were regularly employed were sent home. In addition the old or sick, andthose who had special connections (there were such cases) were released. The rest ofthe Jews, several hundred in number, were transported to the camps in UpperSilesia.This action happened on May 10, the day when Hitler's righthand man, RudolphHess, got into his airplane and flew to England. We don't know what effect thisnews had in other Jewish communities, but in Chrzanow it was like balm for ourwounds. The joy in the city, the hope that the nest of bandits would soon collapse.100The Year 1941AS THIS YEAR began, people felt the noose tightening around their throats. Exter-nally everything appeared calm. For a number of those who dreamed about autono-mous Jewish communities, the national, cultural, and personal autonomy of theJudenrat seemed authentically Jewish. The Judenrat had new missions to carry out.All of the Jewish houses were now formally placed under the control of the S.S., andall rents owing to and from Jews had to be paid to a bureau set up for that purpose.This bureau, as well as the post office located on the Plantn, were both inaccessibleto Jews after the Plantn was Aryanized. Thus the Judenrat had to set up a Jewishbureau to manage all the Jewish homes (comprising 80% of the city), as well as theirown post office, with a Jewish postmaster and officials. The housing bureau was inthe very center of the city, in the Jewish area of Berko Joselewicz Street (betweenKadlubek and Krzyska), and the post office was in the marketplace (at Mandelbaum'shouse), with the entrance also through Berko Street.All of the Jewish businesses, without exception, were Aryanized. That is, they con-tinued their operations, but every one had to have a German administrator (Treu-hendler), who actually controlled the business. The Jew figured only as a servant ofthe German. The Jewish food stores, which distributed to the Jewish population theprovisions received from the Judenrat, were in the same situation.In the spring of 1941, close to Passover, the Jews of Auschwitz (twenty kilometersfrom Chrzanow) were ordered to leave their city immediately. The gas chambers,crematoria, and other demonic instruments for the total annihilation of EuropeanJewry were ready. The Germans apparently didn't want any undesirable popula-tions, especially Jews, so close by. Some of the Jews of Auschwitz came to Chrzanow.The process of finding places for them to live went fairly smoothly and with fewerdifficulties than during previous mass relocations, even though the city was rathercrowded already.At the same time the great advance of the German armies against the Sovietsbegan. Day and night, without interruption, the angels of destruction, who hadalready been slaughtering East European Jews for several months, streamed past.An S. S. group which reached Chrzanow on the first day of Passover stayed there forseveral days, tormenting the Jews terribly. There was no one to turn to. The police inChrzanow, under the lying degenerate Schindler, who didn't stop extorting "gifts”from the Judenrat and from individuals in exchange for his pretend help, organizeda show the memory of which still gives one chills. On the seventh day of Passoverthe police, together with the S.S., surrounded the minyan praying with the popularChrzanow rebe, Reb Chaim Yankele Rosenfeld (m/b/a), led him out into the street99Chrzanowcame to work at the heaviest labor in the local quarries. In Pogorzec near Chrzanow,several dozen Jews were employed building the highway. Later on several dozenJews were hired at the rubber factory in Trzebinia, which the Germans permitted tocontinue functioning. There was no lack of volunteers for work in the Jaworzno coalmines; they even paid money for this privilege, just to be sure they had employment.There was competition for every job, and everyone was firmly convinced that workwould be their salvation, because that was what they were told by the German laborinspector Kleinecke and his representative Nukish. The latter actually gave con-siderable assistance—whether free or for money, we cannot determine—to thehigher class of Jews in Chrzanow.Every job given to a Jew had to be certified in Sosnowiec, by the so-called "SpecialCommission of the S. S. for Foreign Labor Details,'' headed by General Schmeltz. Tothis department belonged those who would later become the Angels of Death forChrzanow Jewry, such as S.S. Obersturmbanfuehrer and former German Armymajor, Heinrich Lindner, his adjutant Bruno Ludwik, Sergeant Knol, and the Ruma-nian Germans Dr. Messner and Kutshinsky. Anyone who received a certificate ofwork from this department soon had to pay a substantial sum, called "sonder," tothe S.S. each month. Those who made these payments felt—or convinced them-selves—that they were safe from being sent to the labor camps.As in other cities throughout Poland, so too in Chrzanow the ghetto began to beenclosed at the end of 1940. First of all the Plantn became totally Judenrein. TheJudenrat, which until then had been quartered at the Jewish community offices atthe home of Reb Kalmen Klein, moved into the municipal building on MickiewiczStreet. Thus the Plantn became purely Aryan. An exception was made for themembers of the Judenrat, who received special permits, and also for those who hadbusiness with the German police, quartered at Reb Mendl Zelinger's house.98The First Judenrattion that the Judenrat buried their own brothers. At the beginning the members ofthe Judenrat didn't understand the ugly role the Germans had devised for them.With rare exceptions, they believed the scurrilous reassurances of the Germans,who said that going to the work camps would improve the situation of the Jews, andso forth. There is no other way to explain the enthusiasm and energy displayed byMerin at the time of the labor details.Apparently Merin didn't entirely trust the Chrzanow Judenrat to carry out the ac-tion. He deigned to come personally to supervise the operation. He delivered aspeech about the importance of work to the assembled Jews of Chrzanow. "Nolonger will the Germans be able to say that we are lazy parasites." Even better, hepromised roast pigeons in the German labor camps, and he promised that after a fewmonths people would be able to come home. In a word, he promised that thingswould be just fine.The first labor detail consisted of the blossoming youth of the city, as well as mar-ried men who couldn't prove that they were in some way employed—altogether,300 young men at the prime of their lives. These young people were assembled inthe elementary school of Mickiewicz Street. Then they were transported by brutalVermacht men in a special train, to the Jewish work camps of Sakrau and Gogolin inUpper Silesia. Signs were hung on the railroad cars, reading "Voluntary Workers forGermany.''The first news from the camps was very bad. The work was hard (the Jews werebuilding the "Reichsautobahn") and the treatment was brutal. The most primitivehygienic accommodations were lacking in the camp, and as a result filth and lice con-sumed the young people. This led the chairman of the Chrzanow Judenrat, BetsalelCuker, to investigate the actual conditions in the camp. With his unrelenting energy,together with Moyshe Nagoshiner, he managed to visit the above-mentionedcamps. The young men from Chrzanow greeted them with bitterness and outcries ofenraged hostility at their fate. He returned heartbroken, but unfortunately he couldnot do anything substantial to help them.The labor details demand further discussion. It is true that a large number of theyoung people of Chrzanow gave up their souls in torture and pain at the work camps.But it should also be noted that the majority of the surviving Jews of Chrzanow—which is a large percentage, relative to other Jewish cities—remained alive on ac-count of the camps. I can attest that if they had not been in the camps, they woulddoubtless have died in the gas chambers in nearby Auschwitz. Other means of sur-vival-such as joining the partisans, hiding in the forests or bunkers, or acquiringAryan papers—were very seldom used here. Merin's claims that the camps wouldsave us from utter destruction contained a small kernel of truth. The question is onlywhether Merin himself really believed his own prophecy.In the belief that it would thus be possible to avoid further deportations to thework camps, there began intensive agitation in favor of the creation of a sort of workcamp in Chrzanow itself. Individual Jews began to secure places to work, some fic-titious and some genuine. With the help of the Judenrat, a camp was established inGromiec, devoted to drainage work near the Vistula. In Libiaz itself, Chrzanow Jews97Chrzanowtion: "This Jew was captured with weapons, fighting against the German army..."After the German victories in France, the level of German terror against Jewsseemed for a short while to diminish. The police looked the other way when Jewscommitted such crimes as praying in public or going for walks outside of the city.Somehow the Germans seemed to be coated with honey at the end of summer 1940.The Jews' terror of them diminished somewhat; people dared to stick their headsoutside of their houses, dress a bit better, and in general breathe more freely.Naturally, this encouraged Jews to gather for prayer in the smaller synagogues. Atthat time, the following curious episode took place.The well-known sadist and police chief Gurtz, whose gruesome, degeneratemethods of torture caused even the Poles to fear him like the plague, happened onemorning to enter the Mizrachi synagogue, which was not far from the police head-quarters. Seeing several Jews there, he asked them what the purpose of their gather-ing was. The congregants, trembling with fear, explained that they wanted to pray,but since they were short of two or three Jews for the minyan, they had to wait untilsomebody else came. Their tormentor didn't say a word, but when he went out intothe street he stopped several Jews who were passing by, took them into the Mizrachisynagogue and said to the Jews who were waiting there: "Here are the rest of theJews you needed. Now you can continue."During that "happy" time the Judenrat managed to get the authorities to agree tothe reopening of the Jewish bathhouse, the only bathhouse in the city available tothe Jewish population. It must be remembered that given the living conditions atthat time, and the general hygienic situation of the Jewish population, the openingof the bathhouse was like a miracle.Even more impressive, in 1940, thanks to the good relations between the Judenratand the German police, permission was received for public prayer on the HighHolidays. These services were held in the Mizrachi Synagogue no less, under thevery eyes of the German police. Even better, the police came to the Mussaf service,and listened to the beautiful cantorial voice of the young student of Reb Hirsh Leyb,Simcha Shonberg, who, as previously mentioned, had miraculously managed toescape from their hands in Trzebinia.LABOR DETAILSIn October of the same year, right on Simchas Torah, the news appeared like ablack cloud: Merin, the director of the central Judenrat in Sosnowiec, arrived with adirective called "labor details," which involved internment in specially designatedJewish work camps. Every Jew was seized by indescribable terror. We had some ideaby then of what it meant to work for Germans, but before, it had at least been possi-ble to go back home after a day at work. Now we would have to part with our nearestand dearest, and go straight to the Devil's lair.As a rule the Germans carried out all of their actions in a panicky rush. They werealways successful, because the efficient apparatus of the Judenrat was at theirdisposal, ready to carry out their orders precisely. Today we can assert with convic-96The First Judenratthose Jews who still had means. The Judenrat also had some income from its inter-ventions with the authorities on behalf of Jews with money. Money had to be raisedby any means possible, regardless of whether it was morally questionable. Naturally,there could be no supervision of the expenditures. This in turn gave rise to rumorsthat the members of the Judenrat were getting rich at the cost of their brothers' suf-fering. At the time it was impossible to determine whether this was true, and today itis utterly impossible.The first major task faced by the new Judenrat, as we have already mentioned, wasto find apartments for the Jews who had just arrived from Upper Silesia, or more ac-curately, the German Jews. These German Jews for the most part had little connec-tion with living and breathing Judaism. The members of the Judenrat had to exercisea great deal of intelligence and tact to get along with these Germanized Jews. Theyhad to be given the chance to live in a reasonably clean and comfortable situation;otherwise there was a danger that they would turn to the authorities and diminishthe independent role the Judenrat had shaped for itself. Although their living condi-tions were better than those of the native Jews, later on many of these German Jewscaused trouble. Unfortunately among them there were traitors who ruined manyfamilies.After the random killings of the Jews from Upper Silesia in the beginning of thesummer of 1940, the situation became generally bearable. While the daily problemsdidn't stop, they were manifested in minor incidents, which we had simply gottenused to. Pious Jews, who refused to remove the "image of God," their beards andpeyes, for all the riches in the world, had to withstand great trials. These Jews weresentenced to remain shut up at home, summer and winter. Even when they were athome, countless times a day they were seized with terror, hearing a German voice orthe sound of German boots on the stairs or in the hallway. How sorrowful and terri-fying it was every time a German caught a Jew with a beard!Hunting beards—Jewish ones only, of course—became a kind of sport for the Ger-man police and their commander Schindler. This sport was connected to a moreuseful occupation—fundraising. If the possessor of the beard was wealthy, he couldbuy it off with money, or with bonen kafee. The latter could buy off even their divineFuehrer.Recalling some other minor incidents that took place during that "quiet" perioddemonstrates the base and shameless methods used by German propagandists.There was an idiot in Chrzanow, a dirty brute, who had been born a Pole, but spokeYiddish. He pretended to be a convert named Avrom Ger. The Germans took thispoor soul and shot him, claiming that because he was so dirty, he could cause anepidemic. Before they shot him they took his picture, which appeared a short timelater in the Nurenburg newspaper Der Stunner over a caption reading,' 'The richestJew in Chrzanow, and so dirty!"Another time the Germans captured the well-known Chrzanow baker and scholarReb Mordechai Shaynovits m/b/a. A small, thin Jew with a sad face, he too wasphotographed, and the picture was published in Der Sturmer with the following cap-95Chrzanowalso a welcome step. This bureau extended its activities from day to day, taking onnew clients. During the course of the war, the financial structure of Chrzanow Jewrychanged entirely. The same Jews who had been givers of charity until the war, nowhad to come to the charity bureau of the Judenrat, and it must be admitted that S.Y.Weiss—incidentally the only survivor from that Judenrat—carried out his work withtact and deep understanding.Hard and thankless tasks fell to the housing bureau. Living conditions inChrzanow hadn't been especially good even before the war. During the war the in-vading army, police, and considerable civilian staff forcefully seized the better livingplaces in the city. The Plantn and the surrounding area became Judenrein (clean ofJews), and its residents had to be moved into other dwellings. This situation becameeven more difficult in the summer of 1940, when a large number of the Jews remain-ing in Upper Silesia were transferred to Chrzanow. The Judenrat's housing bureauhad to find shelter for the first of the refugees.The mass psychology that ruled in 1940 has to be understood. Very few could im-agine that the Germans would slaughter us. It wasn't easy for people to give up thehome that had been theirs for so many years, so the housing bureau had to worktactfully but strictly. It had to be dictatorial but just, in order to find dwellings for theunfortunates who had lost theirs. Naturally, there were frequent tensions amongthe various parties and the Judenrat. The director of this bureau, MoysheNagoshiner, needed a great deal of knowledge and competence in order to resolvethese conflicts.The Judenrat had various additional functions. It had dealings with the police andthe civilian authorities; it provided furniture, linens, and clothing for the Germansand their families, who came like hyenas from every corner of Germany, with theone goal of robbing Jewish goods. Not only that—the Judenrat even had to supplythem with provisions for a feast, on demand.It is interesting to note that at the Judenrat there was a cupboard filled with allkinds of good things, such as cognac, wine, liquor, chocolate, coffee, and other veryrare items. All this was prepared to be given to the Germans when they demandedit. Most of the Germans who came were police, or as they were nicknamed, Shupo’s.Their commander was the always laughing, never satisfied, Oberleutenant Schindler.With his smooth talk and pretended philo-Semitism, he led the annihilation of the12,000 Jews who were in Chrzanow during the war.The Judenrat had colossal expenses, which they either did not want or were for-bidden to record officially. In addition to the charitable activities such as the freekitchen and the "Anshei Chayil" support for needy heads of households, and salariesfor a considerable staff of officials and Jewish policemen, they needed large sums ofmoney to pay off the Germans. Although the oppressive regulations couldn't beavoided entirely through bribery, thanks to the corruption of the Germans, it waspossible to make life a bit easier, a bit more bearable—but even this small goal wasnot always reached.In order to raise the necessary money, appropriate sums were requisitioned from94The First Judenrattorments they summoned from the crowd someone who belonged to the commu-nity council—a young man who had indeed belonged to the community council inSosnowiec before the war, and who had the courage to say, “I was.” This youngman became the infamous "leader” Moniek Merin, who was instrumental in sealingthe fate of the Jews in the cities and towns that were included in the Reich. With hisbrave response Moniek Merin drew the Germans' favor, and they named him thefounder and director of the central Judenrat. Moniek Merin was granted unlimitedpowers by the central office of the Gestapo in Katowice, and the Germans made theright choice. Merin employed his organizational talents for four years (ending withhis own liquidation in the gas chamber at Auschwitz), effectively directing the anni-hilation of over 100,000 Jews within the Reich.Merin, with his sensitivity to organizational function, immediately realized thecompetence of the first Judenrat in Chrzanow and reorganized it, coopting newmembers from among the bourgeoisie. Despite his faults, Merin understood that theJudenrat had to be staffed with responsible people; the hustlers and underworldcharacters had to be gotten rid of.The new Judenrat, which had just been appointed in Chrzanow, consisted of FasekWeber and David Bishte, with whom Merin himself didn't want to come into con-flict, because of their intimate acquaintance with the police. Yosef Shmuel Shonhertzremained from the previous council, because of the honesty and goodwill he haddisplayed in his earlier work. They were joined by Betsalel Cuker, MoysheNagoshiner, Kalmen Teichler, Zelig Grajower, Shmuel Yosef Weiss, and MendlNussbaum.With the installation of the new Judenrat, life became somewhat easier in the city.The new members' position in the Jewish community and experience in communalaffairs guaranteed a degree of security against the neglect indulged in by the formerbosses, Fasek Weber and David Bishte. The latter, pursuing their own self-interest,slavishly and blindly carried out the will of the Germans, rather than using decep-tion to ease the situation of their own brothers.The new Judenrat unquestionably revolved around its chairman, Betsalel Cuker.A proud and nationally conscious Jew with particular talents in communal affairs, hewas honest, just, intelligent, and strict, but also had a warm Jewish heart. In a shorttime he attracted the attention of the Jewish population, introducing into theJudenrat exemplary order regarding every aspect of communal life. First, the laborbureau was set up, headed by Meir Goldberg, who died during the war. An accuratecatalogue of all the able-bodied Jews was developed, and the labor bureau's job wasto distribute the assigned tasks equitably among the Jews. The wild scenes in whichJews were stopped in the street and taken off to work stopped. Rational distributionof the work had to satisfy everyone, because before it had been even worse.The economic bureau, under the direction of Mendl Nussbaum, was assigned thetask of distributing provisions to specially designated Jewish stores according to a ra-tion system. The provisions were sent via the central economic bureau in Sos-nowiec.The creation of the charity bureau, under the direction of Shmuel Yosef Weiss, was93Chrzanowthe new restrictions and regulations that were imposed on us daily. We were used toexpecting "news'* when we got up every day. The most painful thing, which weregarded at the beginning of 1940 as a cruel decree, was that we had to wear whitearmbands with blue Stars of David. If, until that point, Jews had somehow been ableto disguise themselves as Aryans while on the trains, doing business, or even justwalking around freely—all that stopped. This regulation ensured that the anti-Jewish laws would be totally effective, and it eased the task of quickly finding andseizing Jews.In general, the situation stabilized to a certain degree. Random seizure for forcedlabor lessened. The Judenrat created its own labor office, regulating somewhat thework done for the Germans. An obligatory work schedule for every Jew was intro-duced. Each Jew either had to devote one day a week to slave labor, or else pay a cer-tain sum into the account of the Judenrat to hire a substitute.The stores reopened gradually, as they received, paying dearly, renewed licensesfrom the German authorities. With great difficulty they managed to get merchan-dise. The situation of the Jewish workers was very difficult, because nearly all of theJewish industrial enterprises had been closed, and the machinery confiscated.Private artisans had no work because no one thought of buying new things. In thebeginning people managed to find a few pennies to save here and there. Later theybegan selling off anything they could. Some sold jewelry or other valuables, andsome sold clothing, as long as they could stay alive. People lived with confidencethat they would survive the hard times.Chrzanow, which had largely emptied out on the first night of the war, began to fillagain. The Jews who had left in order to escape the murderers returned home,because no other place had been better. On the contrary, the fact that Chrzanow wasincluded in the Reich attracted many naive people, who believed that the regimewould be more tolerant there.THE REORGANIZED JUDENRATIn March 1940 a new Judenrat was appointed in Chrzanow. The initiative came,not from the local German authorities, but from the central Judenrat in Sosnowiec,whose main figure was the chairman, Moniek Merin. Those unfamiliar with thesituation will need a bit of explanation about the scope of the Judenrat. ThroughoutEurope this institution's purpose was to help ease the task of murdering Jews. All ofthe communities included in the Reich were concentrated under the central direc-torate, which was set up in Sosnowiec because it had the largest Jewish community.This central directorate took in the Judenraten in Bendzin, Dambrowa, Gurnicza,Huta, Zawiercie, Chrzanow, Oswiecim, Jaworzno, Trzebinia and other smaller com-munities. The directorate was under the personal supervision of the chief of theKatowice Gestapo, Dr. Dreier, whose fine words about the favors he was going to dofor the Jews considerably influenced the directorate and its chairman Merin.This rat Merin rose to prominence by chance. When the Germans entered Sos-nowiec, they herded the Jews together into one place. After various chicaneries and92The First JudenratOn account of the chaotic work and the incompetence of the first Judenrat, realauthority lay with the police and the various predatory hustlers who crowdedaround, all sorts of "do-gooders" who, thanks to their acquaintance with one oranother German, were able to pay money to have various sins expunged—sins likebeing caught with a beard, praying with a congregation, and the like. The corruptionof the Germans only increased with the arrival of the police chief Schindler, of whommore will be said later. This ugly character liked money, jewelry, and women, andthe Judenrat became a tool in his hands, assisting him in his criminal excesses.There were a few positive moments in the activity of the first Judenrat. Thanks toits intervention, at the end of November 1939 it was possible to provide a propercemetery burial for the first martyrs from Trzebinia, who had been placed in a massgrave there. The free kitchen in the Anshei Chayil synagogue, created by the firstJudenrat, was important because it created the possibility for a rather large numberof families to get a bit of warm food once a day. The Judenrat acquired the food legally,and under the direction of the well-known Chrzanow WIZO activist Mrs. Korngold,the free kitchen served the needs of the time. Individual Jews were forbidden to buythe same food.CHRZANOW BECOMES PART OF THE GERMAN REICHAt the end of December 1939 the borders of the Polish "General Government"were fixed, with Cracow as the capital. Chrzanow was incorporated into the Reich,and the border ran past the village of Dulova, some six kilometers from Trzebinia.The economic situation, which was already bad, received an even greater blow,because Chrzanow had always been closely tied to Cracow. Now Cracow washermetically separated from Chrzanow. In order to cross the border and go toCracow, one needed a passport. Such documents could easily be had for money—ormore accurately, for a bribe. Corruption was the norm among the German officials.Jews and Poles went back and forth. Both sides dealt in merchandise and provisions,which was, of course, forbidden. During the inspection in Trzebinia, Jews were ha-rassed more intensely, because the Germans knew that they'd get payoffs from theJews if they caught them with contraband.A good proportion of the Jews of Chrzanow, left without any livelihood, set off forCracow to try to make a living. This "exodus" took on a mass character. Frightfulshakedowns took place in Trzebinia. This influenced some of the young people tohead individually or in groups toward the Soviet border, where they risked theirlives crossing the river San. Thanks to this initiative, some of Chrzanow's youngpeople managed to escape death.THE YEAR 1940In comparison with the later years, 1940 was the most normal year of life under oc-cupation in Chrzanow. The first blows were over. People had already gotten used to91The First JudenratWRITING THIS chapter about the first Judenrat in Chrzanow arouses mixed feelings.Feelings of shame and anger overcome anyone who recalls this institution, whichcould only have been invented by the Devil himself. At first people thought theJudenrat would be similar to the Jewish community council, with philanthropicaims—a juridical corporation that would represent the Jewish population in dealingswith the German authorities, and so forth. Superficially that was the case, but inpractice the Judenrat was merely a cover for the Germans' dark plans, enabling themto complete the extermination of the Jews more easily and quietly. The first Judenratconsisted of the following individuals: Yosef Umlauf, chair; Weber (Fasek) as deputy;(Bishte) David Wachsberg; Levi Krauskopf and Yosef Shmuel Shonhertz. This firstjudenrat was really controlled by Fasek Weber and Bishte Wachsberg, twocharacters without any sense of Jewish responsibility whatsoever. They had onlytheir own interests in mind when they forced their way into control, because no oneinvited or asked them to serve. These two immediately drew the wrath of the entireJewish population by their many deceitful actions, even the public mention of whichis embarrassing.Yosef Umlauf, as chairman of the Judenrat, was unqualified for the position,despite his good intentions. He failed completely to comprehend the general situa-tion. As an assimilated Jew he was alienated from the Jewish masses; he had no ex-perience as a communal activist; and because he was already seventy years old, hewas like a mannequin in Fasek Weber's hands, dancing to his tune. Shonhertz andKrauskopf, although both responsible and well-intentioned, were also too weak toresist the control of Weber and Wachsberg, fearing their close connections with theGerman police.And to this Judenrat the fate of the 10,000 Jews of Chrzanow was entrusted. Themain task of the Judenrat, according to the German directions, was to see to it thatthe Germans were comfortable. The gymnasium and children's home, which hadbeen transformed into barracks, had to be cleaned by Jews every day. Jews had topolish the boots of any German who demanded it. The Judenrat had to come upwith whatever number of workers the Germans demanded. And they demandedcountless numbers. Quite often the Germans—civilian officials, no less—stoppedJews in the street and made them perform personal services.The Judenrat also had other tasks to attend to, such as providing the police withvarious items that were in short supply, such as coffee, tea, and chocolate. Ofcourse, such transactions created the opportunity for corruption within the Judenratitself.90Before the Wargirl was acquainted, who happened to live in the same house. With a pistol in hishand, the soldier forced the young man to rape the girl in the presence of the soldiersand the girl's mother. He beat the young man murderously during the horrid orgy.One Friday night German soldiers entered the home of the Rosner family. One ofthem climbed up onto the table, where the Sabbath candles were still burning,defecated and threw his feces at the sick woman lying in bed.Such incidents were believed to be isolated acts of riotous, degenerate soldiers.But on the night of October 6, the entire city was suddenly surrounded by soldiers.Machine guns were placed in all the streets, and mass inspections of Jews began.The soldiers used iron bars and axes to open the locked stores, whose owners hadnot yet returned. Many stores were emptied, and the merchandise was taken away.Houses were searched for money and valuables. The barbarians weren't ashamed totake literally the last bit of food from the very poorest. The writer of these linesobserved Jews from whom'' provisions'' had been requisitioned being forced to taketheir last few paper sacks of food onto the street. The Germans later took these away.The house inspections continued all night, and until the middle of the next day.The Germans gained little, however. No one was arrested. As often happens in suchsituations, the Germans didn't want their actions to come to the attention of thehigher authorities, in case they would have to surrender the valuables.This first inspection is noteworthy, because it was the first instance of organizedrobbery of the peaceful Jewish population. It should have induced us to take stock ofour true situation. But there were still quite a few optimists in Chrzanow, who claimedthat the Germans weren't as bad as they were made out to be.89ChrzanowFORCED LABORThe trouble here wasn't with the work itself—the fear of forced labor arose fromthe insulting behavior, bloodletting, and simple brutality with which the Germanstortured their victims. At the beginning of the German rule in Chrzanow, the dirtywork of capturing Jews at home and in the street was carried out by the Polishcivilian militia authorized by the Germans. At first they took to this "holy task" en-thusiastically, but after several days, they turned out to be too weak for the job. Thenthe German soldiers took over, and Jews were taken in the streets and in theirhouses. No one was spared—neither old nor young, the sick nor the weak.Yom Kippur in the year 1939 is etched in my memory. Although no explicit orderforbade us to pray in the synagogue and the study house, the Jews of Chrzanow in-stinctively avoided doing so. They did not want to risk drawing the attention of themad beasts and giving them an excuse for more brutality. Thus Chrzanow Jewsgathered quietly on Yom Kippur in the smaller Chasidic synagogues or in privatehomes, broken-heartedly pouring out their hearts to God, who had so gruesomelypunished them. Suddenly the familiar voices of German soldiers were heard:"Jews, to work!" In the middle of the morning service Jews were taken away wear-ing their kitls and taleysim, some to clean the streets and others to clean the toilets inthe barracks of the Master Race. The Germans knew very well that it was a holy dayfor Jews and that the Jews were fasting. After several hours of hard labor and pro-found humiliation, the Jews were sent home, and finished the morning service as ifnothing had happened. Even Jewish humor wasn't lacking: the well-known Torahreader Reb Shloyme Proper m/b/a, who had worked together with the rest of theJews, used a common German phrase when he was about to resume leading the ser-vice: “Wetter machen!"THE FIRST INSPECTION OF HOUSESAs soon as the Germans entered the city, we immediately sensed that privateproperty and family tranquility meant nothing to them. The myth of Germandiscipline and order turned out to be a simple lie as far as the German soldiers wereconcerned. They frequently broke into private homes by day or at night. Germanregular army officers and enlisted men (at first there was no S.S., S.A. or Gestapo)entered stores, looked over the merchandise, asked the price out of sheer habit,ordered that whatever they had selected be packed, and left behind a small coin inpayment. As they were leaving, the more decent among them gave the excuse thattheir colleagues were taking even more merchandise from other stores, payingnothing, and meanwhile beating the merchants. They weren't lying.Gruesome deeds were committed in the dark of night. Two such incidents areworth mentioning.In the middle of the night a group of German soldiers went to the home of a well-known, established Jewish family (whose name, for understandable reasons, wewill not mention). No one was at home except for the mother and her grown daughter,a young, intelligent girl. One of the soldiers brought in a young man with whom the88Before the Warcommon grave at the Chrzanow cemetery was even worse. The heavens must havebeen wetted by the weeping and wailing of the parents, widows, and orphans. Eventhe few Poles who were present wept.HOSTAGESWhen the war in Poland was over and the mass slaughters by various militaryunits had slowed down, the German military command in Chrzanow began takinghostages. These respected members of the civilian population, both Jews and Poles,were interned in the county courthouse. At first this appeared to be a temporarymeasure, but this curse began to develop into a specific system. Naturally, the mostprominent citizens remaining in town were the ones selected. At first the Germansheld them for a certain time, then let them go free and took others to replace them.Of course, the Jews who were in danger of being taken hostage hid or fled, but theGerman sadists knew what to do about this as well. They simply stopped looking fornew hostages, demanding that the hostages themselves provide substitutes in orderto be released. Thus they tried to force Jews to betray others. But this gambit didn'tget very far, because the Jews who were interned bore their fate with honor.AVIGDOR KLAGSBALDUntil this very day it is not known whether a genuine act of sabotage took place, asthe Germans insisted, or an evil trick was played to frighten the populace. In anycase, it was said that a telephone line had been cut, and the Germans regarded thisas an act of sabotage. An officer went to the hostages, and smilingly announced thattwo of them were to be shot. According to German justice, he took the youngest ofthe hostages, one Jew and one Pole. The director of the health fund, Tshepla, wasthe Pole, and as for the Jew, the misfortune fell on twenty-year-old AvigdorKlagsbald, who had been taken instead of his father, Reb Yitschok Klagsbald. Thevictim was an active Zionist and a member of the bris hatsahar. The first victim of Ger-man "justice” went to his execution like a hero, refusing to have his eyes coveredwhen he was shot. Even the murderous officer who carried out the execution wasmoved by the proud bearing of Avigdor Klagsbald, and ordered that Klagsbald begiven the finest and most prominent grave at the Chrzanow Jewish cemetery.TAXESThe German system of not permitting the Jews to catch their breath made them ex-pert at finding new forms of torment. Not one day went by without new trouble. Thefact that regular taxes were levied only from Jews hurt us morally. From a practicalstandpoint, it was difficult to gather the sums demanded by the military commanderof the city, because the rich men and the better-off citizens hadn't returned to townyet. Jewish representatives were literally forced to go around town with a collectionbag, convinced that in this case, truly "charity saves from death."87Chrzanowheard, "Halt!” Several of the villains stood near us. "Do you have anyweapons?" We told them that everything had been taken away from us,and we never had any weapons. Suddenly some of them said, "Are youthe chosen people?"Klapholz replied, "No!"The German said, "What? No?"We were forced to shout three times, "Yes.” Then he ordered us toshout three times, "We are bandits, we are thieves."When that was finished, he said to us, "Hands up! You'll get it from usyet, you bandits." They herded us back into the brick factory. There wewere confined to the cellar.A short time later we were once again taken out of the cellar into thecourtyard and counted. A soldier asked another how many of us therewere, and the second replied that we were thirteen. "So! Yesterday thesebandits attacked our soldiers with razors. Now we have to give them ashave!" At that moment another soldier came out, carrying a long pistol.The officer asked him, "Did you bring along enough cartridges?" Theanswer was affirmative. We were taken out onto the football field inTrzebinia and as the gate was opened, we saw some twenty people lyingshot in various positions. We were herded further. The soldier grabbed thefirst four by their collars, threw them onto the sand and shot them. Thenhe ordered the nine remaining men to lie down on the ground with ourfaces down. At that moment we began to shout, "Shema Yisroel! " At thatwe heard wild laughter: "Let Jehovah help you!" Then he aimed at ourhearts and shot each one in turn. I was the last. After I was shot, I was stillconscious. I lifted my head to see whether the murderers were still there.When I saw that they had gone, I gathered my strength, made my way tothe fence and threw myself over to the other side. My friend YitschokGrubner also made it over the fence. With my last ounce of strength, Imade my way to the home of a Jew in Trzebinia. From there my wifebrought me home wounded. I lay in bed for six months.This was on the twenty-seventh of Elul, September 11, 1939, at 10:00a.m. The entire football field was covered with military personnel whowanted to attend the execution of a few dozen innocent Jews.The exact number of victims who fell during that gruesome slaughter is difficult toascertain. The Jews of Chrzanow alone, who were properly buried some time laterwith considerable difficulty, numbered more than thirty. The Judenrat at the timedid everything it could to exhume the martyrs and bring them to Chrzanow. Jewishvictims from other towns were buried at the Jewish cemetery in Trzebinia.Gruesome scenes took place while the martyrs were being exhumed. The rab-binical court of Chrzanow required the wives to identify their murdered husbands,in order to avoid questions about their right to remarry later. The scene later on at the86Before the Warand shut the door. The last one to come into the house said he had seen theGermans order Gentile women to get into the cart and drive away withMeir. We were under the impression that Meir had gotten home. We en-vied him. (Author's note: Meir Rosenbaum and his brother were murdered inanother location.)We sat quietly in that house all night. Then a Jewish stranger took a closelook at my brother Motl and said, "Motl, don't you recognize me? Westudied together in the study house in Chrzanow!" He was a Jew fromTrzebinia. His face was covered with tears."What happened to you?" Motl asked him. "Don't ask, my friend! Ihave to say kaddish. I had one son, who studied with the rabbi ofTrzebinia. When we fled we got to Kalisz. During the fire in the synagoguehe wanted to rescue the Torah scrolls. When the German murderers sawthat, they refused to let him leave the burning synagogue, and my childwas burned to death together with the Torah scrolls. Now we've decidedthat we can't wait another minute. As soon as God gives us daylight we'vegot to get out of here."Slowly the sun rose. At 6:00 a.m. we decided that Meir Rosenbaum'sdaughter should go out into the street to see how things looked. The girlimmediately came back, saying that it was quiet in the street. We slowlybegan to leave the house and continued as far as the main street, whichleads to the railroad station. At that moment we noticed in the distanceseveral soldiers washing up in a courtyard. We crossed to the other side ofthe street. When we got close to the soldiers, we heard a shout: "Comeover here!" We were taken to the local elementary school. There we sawthe Jew Zagorski from Chrzanow. He warned us that the situation wasgrim. Mrs. Zimnovodsky (Rosenbaum's sister) was also with us. For somereason she decided to greet the killers in German. For that, she received ahard slap. She could barely get up. We were ordered to strip. All of themen and women were lined up with their faces to the wall, "hands up."They took everything we had in our possession. They cut Mrs. Zimnovod-sky's brassiere open with a knife and took her money. After a short timewe heard them bringing some more people in.The shouts could reach the heart of Heaven. The house was full of peo-ple. The tables were loaded with thousands of zlotys in cash. The soldiers'pockets were full. We were taken out of the house and taken to astoreroom, where we had to kneel for more than two hours. Then we wereordered to get up, after which they released us.It wasn't until we got out onto the street that we saw several people fromChrzanow, including Avrom Korngold, Yitskhok Grubner, Klapholz andseveral others. Everyone wondered: "What are you doing here?" Thus allof us, a group of thirteen, decided to get away from this Hell and go home.When we got to the bridge next to Count Michtselski's brick factory, anautomobile drove by. We didn't pay any attention to it, but just then we85ChrzanowBy some miracle, a single Chrzanow Jew named Simcha Shonberg survived. To-day he is in Belgium. After he was shot, he managed to make his way out fromamong the slaughtered. The following is cited directly from his testimony:In 1939, on Saturday night, the second day of the war, my wife, my sonand I escaped to Cracow. On Wednesday, September 6 the Germans en-tered Cracow. After continuing to wander until Sunday, I decided to returnto Chrzanow, leaving my wife and son in Cracow, so that I would have achance to see what was happening in our town first. As we left Cracow webegan to sense that things were not simple with these brutes. Neverthelessmy brother Motl and I decided to continue. Another acquaintance waswith us. When we arrived at Bronovice, two kilometers past Cracow, wewere ordered to halt with wild shouts, “Bandits, where are you going?You're going to croak here!" Fortunately a cavalry regiment approachedfrom a narrow side street, and when the German soldier saw them, heretreated for the time being. In our hearts we thanked the Lord for thismiracle.Continuing two kilometers further on, we met Meir Rosenbaum and hisentire family from out of town, carrying all their possessions and riding ona cart driven by a Polish coachman. We were happy to meet a few friendsfrom Chrzanow, so that we could ride home together.We were stopped again and taken to a compound near a church to dosome work, but when we saw that there was no real work for us to do, wemanaged to get ourselves free for a small bribe and we left. We rode a goodway further, and then we saw the first victim from Chrzanow, the well-known butcher Reb Kalmen Siegel, lying shot in a gutter.We decided to get home as soon as possible, because the situation seemedto become too risky. At four in the afternoon we arrived at Kszeszowice.There I met my friend Chaim Hirshtal. He said to me: “Listen to me Sim-cha, don't go any further! Let's spend the night in Kszeszowice, and thenwe'll see what we have to do next." But all I wanted was to get home. Itold him that there wasn t a minute to spare, that evening was coming andwe had to hurry. And we proceeded. I said goodbye to Chaim Hirshtal andwe rode on almost until the curfew at 7:00 p.m. Thus we arrived atTrzebinia. When we arrived at the marketplace in Trzebinia, we were ap-proached by several German soldiers. Meir Rosenbaum was certain thateverything would go smoothly. One of them asked us, “Are you Jewish?"At first he wanted to deny it, but apparently the soldier realized that hewas a Jew. He shouted, “What? Aren't you a Jew?"Meir became afraid, and naturally said immediately, “Yes!"“Then you're coming along with us," the soldier ordered him.My brother and I immediately got down from the wagon. Rosenbaum'swife, son and daughter also came with us, and we went into an old house84Before the WarGERMAN RULE UNTIL 1940Around midday on Monday, September 4,1939, the Nazi hordes entered the city.Their first task was to grab people off the streets—Poles as well as Jews—and incar-cerate them. The Jews were kept in the synagogue, the Poles in church. No oneunderstood the purpose of this action; no one was harmed in any way, and the nextday everyone was released. Jews, instinctively sensing what they could expect fromthe "Master Race," hid at home, afraid to appear on the street.Food shortages began during the first days. Willy-nilly, one had to go outside tolook for food, in order to avoid starving. At the bakery, everyone had to stand in lineto receive enough bread to keep body and soul together. This was our first greatdisillusionment. We had made a sober reckoning of what we could expect from theGermans, and were psychologically ready for both moral and physical torture. Butsoon we received the first blow from none other than our "dear" erstwhileneighbors, the Poles. They were the ones who pointed out the Jews to the Germansoldiers, who couldn't tell the difference between Jews and Poles. They didn't knowany German, but with sign language they pointed out: "Jude! ”THE FIRST VICTIMThe first Jewish victim of the Germans in Chrzanow was Reb Chaim Reiber's son-in-law, a young man who was a bit hard of hearing. He was crossing the street; theGermans wanted to detain him, and when he didn't hear them shout "Halt!" theyshot him on the spot. Despite their fear of going outside, the few Jews who remainedin the town, led by a member of the burial society named Wolf Schif (m/b/a), attendedto the corpse and quietly buried the young man at the cemetery. The Germansoldiers coldbloodedly assembled 15 Jews and lined them up against a wall to shootthem. By some miracle, a higher officer came to investigate the situation, and theJews were released.THE TRAGEDY IN TRZEBINIAOn Friday, September 8, the Jews of Chrzanow who had escaped to other regionsbecause they believed that the Polish army would put up some resistance, began tostream back into the city. Actually the Germans were already at the gates of Warsaw.When the Germans arrived in Trzebinia, a town five kilometers from Chrzanow, theyseized these returning Jews en masse and shot them without mercy, old and young,throwing them still alive into a pit next to the monastery not far from the Trzebiniarailroad station. These mass slaughters continued on Sunday, September 10 andMonday, September 11. For the record it should be specified that this brutality wascarried out not by the S.S. Gestapo or the S.A., but by regular German armytroops—in fact, a unit of the German work brigades under the army's command,men of the working classes who used to shout slogans like "Freedom,""Brotherhood," and "Unity." It also should be noted that members of theMickiewicz nation gladly pointed out those who were Jewish.83Before the WarTHE OUTBREAK of the war did not come as a surprise to Chrzanow. As early asAugust 1939, people were growing anxious about what was to come. The proximityof the German border and the concentration of Polish military personnel in UpperSilesia inspired the population to do some hard thinking. Starting with the signingof the German-Soviet pact on August 23, the situation deteriorated steadily, untildaily life was thoroughly infused with a sense of panic. Located on the mainhighway between Katowice and Cracow, Chrzanow witnessed the evacuation of thecivilian population who lived near the German border. Long caravans of automo-biles, jammed with people and belongings, made their way through the city. Theycontinued ever onward into the countryside in order to be as far as possible from theenemy. For eight days the traffic continued without a moment's pause. Economiclife was almost entirely disrupted; people stopped believing in tomorrow.The wealthier Jews of Chrzanow deposited their valuables with relatives andacquaintances. Everyone who could do so sent his wife and children to a saferregion. The situation of the less prosperous merchants and storekeepers, small in-dustrialists and artisans, grew catastrophic in the days just before the war, becauseeveryone was hoarding cash. People simply stopped buying. Everyone wanted tosecure as much hard cash as possible in case it came to war.At home people were busy blackening their windows. The Poles were pessimis-tic—they were quite sure that war was coming. Jewish opinion was divided, withsome not believing that war would break out. It is worth mentioning that on theevening before war was declared, Poles belonging to the ruling party called a publicmeeting, which featured slogans about the struggle against Jewish business.At six in the morning on Friday, September 1,1939, even before we knew that thewar had broken out, German fliers bombarded the Trzebinia railroad station. Therethe first victims fell. Panic grew by the minute. It was announced on the radio thatCracow was being bombarded. Railroad traffic stopped almost completely, as did thetraffic between Katowice and Cracow. That afternoon and all day Saturday, thou-sands of refugees, including women and children, streamed through the city, somein wagons but the majority on foot. Most were Poles from Upper Silesia. The realiza-tion that even the Poles were afraid of the Nazi troops had a depressing effect on theJews of Chrzanow.On Sunday, September 3, the Jews began to flee in panic. Some had carts, somehad wheelbarrows, some had bicycles. But most of them left on foot on Sundayevening and Monday morning, going wherever their feet carried them, abandoningtheir homes and all their possessions.82PART II Introductionup various stories in order to avoid telling them the whole truth, from which, in ouropinion, many Jews would have drawn the correct conclusions.This also implies that we shouldn't place too much blame on the members of theChrzanow Judenrat who, during the ultimate extermination, danced like trainedbears to the rhythm of the music from Sosnowiec, unlike Betsalel Cuker, who waskilled earlier.Even Sigmund Freud couldn't comprehend the psychology of these people, whoheld sway over Jewish life during the occupation. People who were experienced incommunal affairs, people of deep understanding, carried out the German orders likewell-trained dogs. Suffice it to recall just one sad fact. The last member of theJudenrat in Chrzanow, whom the Germans left behind to carry out the "technical"liquidation of the Judenrat as an institution after all the Jews of Chrzanow had beentaken away to the gas chambers—this person, who watched his brothers and sistersbeing led away to the slaughter, followed the Germans' command two days after thefinal "transfer" and demanded that the few Jews who were still hiding in attics andbasements come out of their hiding places and report voluntarily to the police. Hehimself personally went through all the empty Jewish houses, shouting that theJews should come out of their bunkers, that nothing would be done to them. And thefew Jews who still believed him this time fell into the bestial hands of the Germans.If Jews had known the naked truth, the terrible reality, many individuals, especiallythe younger ones, would have been able to save themselves from destruction. Theleaders in Sosnowiec convinced themselves as well as others that if everyone waswell behaved and anticipated the will of the Germans, then there was hope thatsome might survive. We don't want to state that this was done intentionally, inhopes of saving their own lives. More likely it was their naive belief in the decency ofthe Germans, and their lack of ability to behave decisively and responsibly. Com-pared with other Jewish cities, the slaughter in Chrzanow took longer, was donemore carefully, and thus was perhaps even more gruesome than in other locations.In this second section I have attempted a chronological depiction of the slaughterof the Jews of Chrzanow. I have tried to use simple words to draw a picture for thegeneration to come, so that they will know of the death of a city full of Jews whowere honest and hardworking, who still believed in humane justice until they werekilled.81PART II - War Years!Introduction/ /Now go and write it downin a book that itmay be before themforever and ever.''—Isaiah xxx, 8ALTHOUGH THE system and the methods of extermination employed by the Nazimurderers were the same virtually everywhere, the slaughters in Chrzanow, asgenerally in the part of Poland that was incorporated into the German Reich, werecarried out "legally," according to "juridical formalities." All of the barbarism prac-ticed in Chrzanow was supposedly consistent with German jurisprudence. Thepolice followed set regulations; there were security organs for personal protection, alocal council, a German labor bureau, and so forth. Jews had access to the entire Ger-man bureaucracy. Jews paid regular taxes, and even received ration cards as did thenon-Jewish population. The ghetto that was eventually set up wasn't surrounded bya fence or barbed wire—the exit was open.Nevertheless, on the moral plane Chrzanow Jews suffered more than Jews inother parts of Poland and Lithuania prior to their destruction. This was because, liv-ing on the German border, for generations Chrzanow Jews had gotten along wellwith the Germans, done business with them, believed in their good character, andhad a high opinion of German culture. As a result, they weren't afraid of the Ger-mans. People knew that the Germans were foolish and hot-headed, but ChrzanowJews were unable and unwilling to believe them capable of what they eventually did.Thus the Jews of Chrzanow were filled with false optimism, and as a result only avery small number of them survived the terrible slaughter.More than one reader will wonder: How could it be that so close to Auschwitz, nomore than eighteen kilometers away, Chrzanow Jews didn't see what was going on?We've asked ourselves the same question—but not until it was already too late.Throughout the entire occupation we believed that what might be happening else-where wouldn't come to Chrzanow. In our city, we thought, the Germans wouldbehave in a more "cultured" manner. This view was justified to a certain extent, be-cause Nazi rule in Chrzanow was carried out more or less according to the legalities.Harassment and even murder—every cruel action—was carried out according to acertain plan, with forethought, with more sympathy and "practical" explanationsthan in the rest of Poland and Galicia, where the mass slaughters were carried out inopen brutality for the heavens to witness.The tactics of the central office of the Judenrat in Sosnowiec contributed signifi-cantly to the air of optimism. It is impossible to believe that Merin, the director of theJudenrat, didn't know what "transfer" meant. The fact is that the "transfers" fromChrzanow were carried out after those in Sosnowiec and Bendzin. Instead of warn-ing the Jews of the coming disaster, instead of shouting out, "Jews, run for yourlives, you have nothing left to lose"—he lied to his own Jewish brothers. He thought80How Goodly Are Your Tents, O Jacobeternity. Therefore, we proudly look back at our former Jewish life, and although ourhearts bleed on account of our colossal loss, nevertheless we cry out with all the feel-ings we can summon: "How goodly are thy tents, O Chrzanow!"79Chrzanowfrom the entire surrounding region, the generosity with which their receptions andfarewells were prepared, events at which singing and dancing were taken outsideinto the streets. Months later Gentiles could still recall the melody of the Chasidicsong' 'The voice of joy and salvation,'' singing it like a popular song. Yes, Judaism asa part of daily life in Chrzanow was not only seen, but also heard. The sound of theTorah echoed in the streets, coming out of the various Chasidic studyhouses in thecenter of the city, as well as the main synagogue and Talmud Torah.According to the rabbis of the Talmud, "every place which does not have ten menfree to study full time is not a city"; in Chrzanow their number reached dozens andhundreds. Most were scholars who had achieved a reputation throughout the worldfor their broad and deep knowledge, as well as their own compositions. TheChasidic sector, which influenced customary clothing in the city, was only a frag-ment of the overall Jewish cultural life. The external view was only a reflection ofdeep and rich Jewish content.Chrzanow was shaped by the activity of Jewish organizations of all descriptions.Not only did Chrzanow have a vital Jewish middle class, but also a substantialJewish wealthy class and a strong, organized Jewish artisan class. We had well-developed Zionist and socialist parties. The remarkable thing was that in Chrzanow,unlike most other Jewish communities, all of the parties lived together not only inpeace, but even in a certain harmony.Sabbath in Chrzanow deserves particular attention. Sabbath was entirely Jewish.The image described in Bialik's poem "The Sabbath Queen" was fully realized inour city. Sabbath in Chrzanow revealed the essence of Judaism in all its aspects. Notonly the calm and the absence of commerce made an impression, but also the streamof Jews with shtreimelech and long coats going to and from services added life andJewish charm. To go walking on the Plantn in a shtreimel and a Sabbath coat was en-tirely normal, as it was for a Jew wearing a shtreimel to take his horse to water on theSabbath.Despite the distinctiveness of Jewish life in Chrzanow, anti-Semitism was negli-gible. On the contrary: the strength of the Jewish community made it a force to bereckoned with by outsiders. It is worth mentioning that the Gentile town councilspecified that at public meetings and celebrations the rabbi or Jewish representativewas to make his address in Yiddish. (We remember what people said during thetenure of the Polish mayor named Gdula. When the rabbi took his place to deliver aspeech, it was "Torah and greatness [gdula] [joy in Yiddish] in one place.") We werenot only a qualitative but also a quantitative force in Chrzanow. We had our ownpotential force, which we fortunately never had to use.Now, when that entire vital Jewish city has been transformed into a cemetery fullof martyrs, now we are united only by our memories of that glorious past. Thesearen't memoirs. They are living symbols of Jewish eternity, which are connected toour city. The deep national consciousness, the feeling for love and justice whichwas etched into our hearts and minds, now leads us toward a better future. Our richheritage will enable us to forge our future and continue to spin the thread of Jewish78How Goodly Are Your Tents, O Jacob!Berish ZoltyWhen we describe our city, we don't need to be ruled by the sentiments that everyJew feels for the place where he or she was born and raised. When we look back, wecan free ourselves of subjective favoritism and still claim openly that Chrzanow de-serves a prominent place in the history of Jewish communities in Poland. It is noexaggeration to say that Chrzanow was distinct from many other Jewish cities inPoland, including larger ones, not only because a rich, vital, creative Jewish lifepulsated in Chrzanow, but also because the city's external appearance bore a dis-tinctively Jewish stamp.Chrzanow had a substantial Jewish majority. (For a long time it had a Jewish mayor.)In order to minimize the power of the Jewish population, the Gentile city govern-ment incorporated the surrounding villages into the municipality. To describe theexternal Jewish appearance of the city, we will give space to our greatest enemy, theHitlerite press.In 1945,1 came into possession of an article from the Ostdeutscher Morgenpost datedMarch 17, 1942, under the headline “The City of Krenau" (Chrzanow). During thedisinfection in Buchenwald, it was taken from me, but I memorized several verses:The City of Krenau (Chrzanow)Leaving the Old Reich and heading in the direction of the General Govern-ment District of Cracow, we encountered for the first time a city which,owing to its unmistakably Jewish landscape, made an especially negativeimpression on us. The place is swarming with characters who are all tooeasily recognizable in their bearing and behavior. Here, until quite recently,the Jews ruled the entire city, including its trade and industry. Today,however, they have been isolated from their center, and one day they willentirely disappear from the city.We see that even during the war, when the Jews in Chrzanow were forced to restricttheir action and to observe the saying “any attention of the princess is a danger"—even then the obvious Jewish character of the city was all too clear to the Nazireporter. We believe that the huge enmity expressed in the cited sentences bestdescribe Jewish Chrzanow. And we must add that its character was dominated bythe religious and Chasidic segment of the population. We have to remember howmany people flocked to the ritual meals conducted in Chrzanow by Chasidic rebesChrzanowinsane and thoroughly witless. If a candle sputtered or leaned on Yom Kippur night,Avremele Bentsher immediately arrived with a Gentile who would set it right. Thepoles for the chupah for weddings, the chair for Elijah The Prophet, for circumcisions,all were brought by Avremele Bentsher. At funerals as well, nothing began withoutAvremele Bentsher.As often happened, an epidemic broke out in town. At the turn of this century,epidemics weren't recognized as medical emergencies; rather, they were blamed onthe local sinners. Investigations were made, and eventually it would be discoveredthat the young couples weren't careful enough... Their beds weren't far enoughapart; or many young wives weren't careful enough with their wigs, leaving some oftheir own hair showing, may we be preserved! Such sins demanded a sacrificialatonement. The usual practice at the time was to atone by arranging a wedding be-tween a male and a female orphan at the cemetery. But the town had a problem:where would they get a pair of orphans? And there was an additional condi-tion—they had to be from among the poor.The problem wasn't hard at all for the joker Moyshe Mizel. He immediately cameup with a way to kill two birds with one stone—fulfill the commandment of arrang-ing weddings, and also ridding the town of the epidemic.As you've no doubt guessed, the groom was none other than our Avremele Bent-sher. Since he was over sixty years old by then, of course both of his parents haddied.A similar orphan "girl" was found. The younger generation in Chrzanow knewher as Hindzhe, who had carried large packs of clothing on her back for the pastseveral years, unwilling to part with them for a single minute. In her youth she hadbeen quite beautiful, but at the same time, as we used to say in Chrzanow, "a bitrobbed."Moyshe Mizel played the part of the father-in-law, and the draftees were the other"in-laws" and guests.The wedding was performed at the cemetery on a Saturday night. The things thatwent on there may be left to your imagination. Not only the living enjoyedthemselves, but also the dead in their graves doubled over with laughter. Agenerous wedding supper was served. Everyone danced and sang until well into themorning, and the draftees went home as drunk as Lot.And the epidemic was averted.76FolklorePoliceman: "What did he say this time?"Translator: "He said that when you're defeated, he's going to take revenge onyou."Policeman: "Tear that bum limb from limb and turn him into chopped meat."Policeman to translator: "Tell that Polish pig that if he were a Jew I'd shoot him onthe spot, and I'm going to give you a cigarette for your good translation!"THE DRAFTEESOlder Jews from Chrzanow no doubt remember what used to happen in the winternights with the draftees who had been called up for Austrian military service. Inorder to avoid service, they would torture themselves and stay up all night so thatthey would be released from the spring exercises, which were held around Passovertime. In order to stay awake, they would pull various pranks which made everyonelaugh. The following stories tell of some of these pranks.If You Don't Give Willingly, You Will Have to Give UnwillinglyA rich man in town, Reb Leyb Gross, once refused to give a substantial sum for acertain charitable purpose, saying that he was short of money because he wasbuilding a new house. At that time the leader of the draftees was the popularChrzanow joker Moyshe Mizel who undertook to force the rich man to come up withthe sum.Moyshe Mizel assembled all the draftees, and one night, under his command,they removed the bricks that had been stored for the new house and used them tobuild a path to the cemetery. The next day the rich man came up with the sum inquestion, promising to be good and pious forever.ExchangeOne beautiful winter morning the men of Chrzanow woke up to a city they couldhardly recognize. The butcher's sign hung on the doctor's house, the druggist's signhung at the shoemaker's, and so forth. At first the women said that this was thework of "demons," may we be preserved, but later the true explanation came tolight:Since the draftees, who stayed up all night, generally gathered in the municipalstudy house and caused damage there, the officers decided to close the study houseat night, and to forbid the draftees from entering. But the draftees immediatelydecided to take revenge in a way that would make the city remember them. They ex-changed the signs on all the stores in town, and it caused such confusion that thecitizens went to the officers and begged them to let the draftees back into the studyhall.Avremele BentsherYears ago there was a Jew in Chrzanow named Avremele Bentsher who was half75Chrzanowthat "Reb Shmuel's children should go the way their father went..."What Is True Honesty?It is possible to acquire the World to Come in a single hour. This saying applies toReb Velvele Loyber, m/b/a, a simple Jew without any pretensions, a wholesome manin the fullest sense of the word. The following story took place once upon a time.Since he knew that Reb Velvele was a responsible and honest person, the well-known money changer Reb Leybtshe Klein gave him several hundred dollars to takefrom Cracow to Chrzanow, as a favor. Reb Leybtshe didn't offer him a commission.When Reb Velvele arrived in Chrzanow, he realized that $200 was missing. After along investigation, the rabbi ruled that Reb Velvele would have to swear that hehadn't taken the money. But Reb Velvele refused, saying that he had never sworn inhis life, and he wasn't about to start. He would sooner sell his house and pay backthe money he had lost. But just as he was about to sell his only possession, hishouse, a miracle occurred. The Jew who had found the missing money appeared.Thus Reb Velvele, whom people had begun to suspect of foul play, went away withhis name cleared and enjoyed everyone's respect forever after.Don't Argue With MoneyYidl Kurts was once found sitting at home on Rosh Hashanah, while all the Jewswere on their way to the town river to say Tashlich. When asked why he wasn't go-ing to cast his sins into the river, he answered: "I can't let myself get away with thesame thing that Reb Itshele Yakov-Ruven's or Reb Yenkele Aba's do. Their sins con-sist of such trivialities as making a mistake in a single word while saying grace aftereating on the Sabbath. Or someone else ate beans for lunch, passed wind while say-ing his afternoon prayers, and couldn't wash his hands immediately... Sins likethese can be easily cast into the river, but my sins cost me a lot of money, and itwould truly be an even greater sin to simply cast them into the water!"Isser Lapke, TranslatorWhen the Germans first came to Chrzanow they used Jews as translators. TheJewish population felt even more hatred toward the Poles than toward the Germans,because the Jews expected evil from the Germans, and were psychically ready for it,but the Poles were noted for their provocations and treachery. Our hearts bledwatching the Poles gleefully rubbing their hands as they witnessed our tragedy. Justabout that time the Germans arrested for some trivial transgression a Pole who wasknown for his hostility toward Jews. The German, being unable to communicatewith him, called in Isser Lapke (who was well known as a joker in town) to translate.Pole: "I didn't know it was forbidden."Policeman: "What's he saying?"Translator: "He said that he's in his own home and can do whatever he wants."Policeman: "Slap the bum and knock out a tooth."Pole: "Why do I deserve to be hit?74Folklorewrite on the note that she had a son with three failings: first, he plays the violin; sec-ond, he sings very beautifully; third and worst, he writes verse. The rebe pushed hisspectacles up onto his forehead and looked at the woman as if she were mockinghim. “These are three of the finest virtues a woman could expect from a son."“Yes," the woman said, “he plays the fiddle, and some people realize he's a fool.It's worse when he sings, because then people in the synagogue realize he's a fool.But the worst is his writing—then the entire world knows he is a fool...“A Sin That's Not Mentioned in the TorahThe rabbi of Jaworzno, Reb Vove Rozenblum b/m, had a son who lived far awayand wasn't especially pious. The son sent the father money and gifts on several occa-sions. Reb Vove didn't want to accept them, because he wasn't sure the money hadbeen earned in the spirit of the Torah. One time the rabbi received a large sum ofmoney from his son, along with a letter saying that if he returned the money asusual, then just to spite him the son would commit a sin the likes of which aren'tdreamed of by Jews or by Gentiles. The rabbi didn't want to be responsible for such adreadful sin, so he accepted the money on condition that the son tell him what sin heintended to commit. His son responded, “I would have put on tefilin on the Sab-bath. .."I Know the Solution—But I'm Not Telling(from nearby Cracow)Reb Leyb Ziser of Cracow (owner of the large house at # 13 Kuzmark), was knownfor his intelligence, wealth, and impressive appearance. He had many Jewish vir-tues, but only one major failing. He was not well versed in traditional literature...Once when he was in the city of Pressburg—at that time one of the greatest centersof Torah—he went to the yeshiva of the Chasam Sofer to wait until it was time toboard his train. Just then two students of the yeshiva were debating a certain finepoint, and since they couldn't come to an agreement, they decided to ask Reb Leybfor the proper interpretation. Reb Leyb Ziser, seeing that he was stuck, said to theboys: Listen, children! You could, heaven forbid, have embarrassed a Jew withyour question, because a Jew like myself, despite the beautiful beard, could never-theless be an ignoramus. If that happened, you would lose your share in the worldto come. I have the solution on the tip of my tongue, but to punish you for being socareless.

Later, when hebuilt his own house and was quite comfortable, he said to his wife, "Ghana, the rabbialways sends messengers to fetch me.

When he went to see Reb Chaim in Sanz, his wife asked him to men-tion to the rabbi that he was having problems earning a living. On his way back, hiswife asked him, "Well? Did you mention money to the rebe?""No!" was Reb Yakov Ruben's response. "When I reach Sanz, I never rememberanything as prosaic as money. I only remember it when I get back home."Praying With a RoosterIn Trzebinia near Chrzanow, the synagogue and the study house were in the middleof the market place. In the summer, when the windows were open, the merchantsand customers used to say the prayers kedushe and borchu together with the con-gregations. A Jewish woman was in the middle of making a deal for a rooster whilesaying the kedushe, and lifted her heels at the words, "Holy, holy, holy." Thesaleswoman said to her, "You can jump up and down all night, I'm not going to giveyou the rooster for a penny cheaper!"CompetitionThe well-known Chrzanow marriage broker, Reb Chaim Gross, was summoned tothe tax department regarding the taxes he paid on his fees for arranging marriages.Reb Chaim said to the official: "I'll pay you as much as you demand, on conditionthat you forbid the boys and girls to meet at the Plantn because since the Plantnbecame popular, I have no more customers, neither boys nor girls..."Three Virtues Which Are FlawsA Jewish woman went to a rebe with a request.

He was always given an etrogby oneof the wealthier citizens on Sukkoth; on Passover he was a partner in the selling offlour, and on the Sabbath he was given a kugel, in addition to the salary he receivedalong with the cantor and the shames. The answer he offered was that the rabbi neededa salary so that at least he could put on his phylacteries without requiringpayment...Let It RotThere was a self-assured and demanding woman in town, who had a learned andwell-mannered son. The neighbors wore out their feet looking for a proper match forthe son. But no matter how much was offered as a dowry, it was never enough forthe mother. Once a marriage broker said to her, "Tell me, Kayle dear, what and howmuch do you really want for your son?" She gave him a very businesslike answer:"If you don't bring me a well-mannered and pretty girl with a dowry of five thou-sand dollars—let my goods rot in my warehouse!”Caught LyingBerish Frister, a well-known horse trader, wasn't an especially pious or observantJew. When he traveled to horse fairs, his wife always packed into his suitcase histalis and phylacteries, along with provisions: a challah and a stomach pouch filledwith meat. Once his wife decided to find out whether her husband actually prayedwhen he traveled, and she packed the stomach into the tefilin bag. When he returnedfrom his journey on Friday, her husband complained that she hadn't given him anystomach as she usually did. "It's because you didn't pray," his wife answered, tak-ing the stomach out of his tefilin bag.Good YiddishThe former Polish finance minister Michalski was the tax inspector in Chrzanowunder the Austrians.

Doctor—when a pot is available I have no problem!"ResurrectionThe former municipal doctor of Chrzanow, Dr. Klein (who served before Dr.Hochbaum), always said that he denied all the principles of the Jewish faith, exceptfor the principle of resurrection of the dead. Jews who suffer bitterly all week long,don't eat when they should or as much as they want to, nevertheless when the Sab-bath afternoon comes, make kiddush on an empty stomach over 96-proof liquor anda cracker, then they eat a portion of fat carp, fat galerete, cholent with fatty kishka(derma), kugel dripping with chicken fat and lots of heavy dessert and then, theirstomachs stuffed to the maximum, they take a mid-day snooze.

He lovedto celebrate at Chasidic weddings, but he knew very little of worldly affairs. Once hereceived a wedding invitation from an acquaintance of his, which mentioned that aseparate cloakroom would be prepared at the wedding.

The others are just as fine Jews as the Bobover, aren'tthey?"Menashe explained it to him: "It's just like the difference between Smiechowski'ssoap (a famous firm in Cracow, which demanded high prices), and Gasner's soap (asmall factory in Chrzanow, which belonged to Menashe's uncle).

Arriv-ing there late in the evening, they began to say evening prayers in their hotel rooms.One of them finished the Amida first, rapidly said Aleinu, and started out of theroom. The second, not wanting to interrupt himself in the middle of the Amida,winked at him and asked, "Nu akh?" ("Where are you going?")

Dr. Marek, came to Chrzanow from Cracow. After his speech in the court-yard of Berish Prister's house, which was well received, he drove away in hisautomobile which emitted a strong smell of gasoline. At that a supporter of an op-posing candidate (Reb Yisroel Shimen Grubner, b/m), called out to the crowd, "Yousee?

The father decided that the only ex-planation was that the spirit of a dead person had entered into his son's body. Therabbi assembled a minyan of Jews, ordered candles to be lit, and summoned his son,so that he could exorcize the evil spirit. When the shofar was blown he shouted threetimes, following the custom: "Dibbuk! Dibbuk! Leave my son!"To that the "dibbuk"—namely his son—responded: "Nonsense!

One of these German Jews observed his father'syortsayt during his visit to Chrzanow. He wanted to make sure that there would be aminyan the first thing in the morning, and he gave the shames two gulden to makesure of it. The German Jew arrived punctually, like a German, but the ten Jewsweren't there yet. The shames explained to the German Jew, "The Jews have to pre-pare themselves for prayer.""What do you mean, 'prepare'?" asked the German.The shames explained to him that before they pray, pious Jews drink tea, thenthey smoke their pipes, they go to the bathroom, and then to the mikvah. And that'swhat preparing means. The German Jew listened to everything patiently, and thenresponded in a strict tone: "When I come back next year. I'll give you five gulden.

The Master of the Universe should have done justthe opposite—he should have driven out the Egyptians and left the Jews in theircountry. He should have sent the Egyptians into the desert for forty years, honoredthem with exile in Babylonia, exile throughout the Roman Empire, and wanderingsdown to the present day. We Jews would have it just fine, if we had stayed in Egyptuntil the present day!67FolkloreSome stories have been left out because they could not be translated effectively.WITH THE death of millions of Polish Jews, a vast treasure of Jewish folklore, theproduct of generations of creativity, was lost as well. Every province, city, and townhad its own special sayings, parables, tales, jokes and the like. Even if many of thesesayings had the same moral, they were repeated in different versions in various loca-tions, always fitting the everyday existence of the Jews who used them.Entire volumes could be filled with the collected folklore which was passed amongJews, in their study houses, Chasidic synagogues, in the house and in the street.Even the unprintable was valuable for its sharp wit, which is so characteristic of ourEastern Jews.Our present task is a limited one, our capacities minimal. We have collected thematerials for this sample of Chrzanow folklore in haste, to save this tiny remnantfrom oblivion, and to serve as an example. Perhaps other Jews from Chrzanow willundertake the rewarding task of collecting and recording what we have neglected,because our memory has grown weak as a result of the concentration camp andother troubles. In fact, I have not limited myself to that which has an immediate con-nection to Chrzanow; rather, I have tried to encompass the folklore that wascharacteristic of Chrzanow Jews.A Saint Wearing FurGenerally this expression is used to describe someone whose manner is extremelyreligious, who seems to consider himself a fine Jew, but who does not give to charity.Rabbi Shloymele explained the expression thus: In the winter, when it is cold, onecan warm oneself in two ways. One can stay near the stove, or wrap oneself in a fur.The first way, someone else can benefit as well, but a fur benefits only the one whowears it.—Heard from Reb Ben-Tsion Hirshberg, b/m.“A Poor Man Is Considered as if Dead"Fat Moyshe Aron supported himself with money which he received from hischildren in Cracow every month. It so happened that one month the money didn'tarrive on time, so Moyshe Aron sent a telegram to his children: "Your father isdead." When the children arrived by train they went straight to the cemetery andasked the gravedigger when the funeral was going to take place. The gravediggerlaughed out loud and told them that he had just seen Moyshe Aron joking around atthe market place. When they met their father, the children asked why he had tricked66Leisure ActivitiesCracow nibbler; Oswiecim doltnfreser: Tshebiner Korach.Ksheshovitser/Sodom: The people from this town were considered immoral.Chrzanow Tsaban: "Purebred/' born Chrzanowites.Polish Pig: An epithet for people from Congress Poland.Galician Disaster: Those who stemmed from Central or Eastern Galicia.A large number of Jews weren't called by their last names, but rather by theirfather's or grandfather's names, such as: Yosl Moyshe Reb Simen's, ShloymeMoyshe the Rabbi's, Itshele Reb Yankev Ruven's, Moyshe Avrom Heshl's, YankeleAba's, Faygele Melech's, Mendl Cini's, and so forth.Names deriving from physical characteristics included: Big Aron, Tall Motl, TallDovid, Little Shmuelke, Fat Pinkhas, Skinny Leyb, White Zelig, Red Shmuel, BlackDovid, Green Gershon, Pink Moyshe.Names indicating where the individual came from were Reb Shloyme Kotzker,Miriam from Mentkov, Reb Meir Tshebiner, the teacher from Cracow, the teacherfrom Dombrowa, the teacher from Warsaw, Polish Mendl, and so forth.All of these nicknames were used on a daily basis, to the extent that someone fromout of town with the address and last name of the person he or she was looking forhad a hard time finding where to go. A number of comical incidents also arosebecause a stranger couldn't properly pronounce a certain nickname. Thus, trying toindicate who he was looking for, he instead invented a new nickname... and itstuck.ChrzanowBocian (Stork): He had a long neck.Cap (Male Goat): A nickname for someone who didn't understand much... a dope.Droybe: Skin and bones, without a bit of flesh; emaciated.Doydele: Useless, always had bad luck.Homen (Haman): A bad-natured person.Zimna-Dupa (Cold Behind—from Polish) A lifeless, phlegmatic person.Zhlob: A glutton; a slob.Ciucmak: Almost an idiot; schlemiel.Ciol: Thick-headed, slow to comprehend.Jajcorz (from Polish for egg): An egg dealer.Loksh (Noodle): Tall and thin. Since the first "Loksh" was named Shiye, othersnamed Shiye were also called Loksh.Mocher-Litke: Mentioned in Chrzanow folklore.Naser (The Wet One): He had been rescued from drowning in the river.Sroydali: A Jew who had a textile goods store in the market; whenever a Gentilecustomer didn't want to pay the stated price, this was his response. It's a factthat 90% of the Jews of Chrzanow didn't know his real name, and called himby this nickname.Tsap (Pourer): Son of an innkeeper, whose father often ordered him to draw beerfrom a barrel.Kelbl (Calf): There were two brothers, and since one of them was called Cow, theyounger was called Calf.Koze (Goat): Someone who was lively, half wild.Knaytsh (Bend): A tavemkeeper who served beer on credit on the Sabbath, sincehe wouldn't take any money. He had a book containing the names of his steadycustomers, and in order to keep track of their tab, he would bend over thesheet with the appropriate customer's name. Every time he poured a glass ofbeer, he told his daughter, "Mirl! Bend!"Kozemashin: An enterprising Jew. He was the first to bring a booth with a stove toChrzanow, and it looked a bit like a car. He roasted potatoes and chestnuts,drew apple wine with seltzer from a copper jug, and most impressive, had asort of roulette game—a wheel with a wooden stork in the middle. One couldwin an entire string of figs, or a round coconut. The whole business was calledthe Kozemashin. Even the owner's children and grandchildren werecalled Kozemashinen.Ribbentrop: This insulting nickname belonged to a Jew named Ruven, whosenose always dripped. People would say: "Ruven s'tropt (your nose isrunning)." That evolved into Ribbentrop, later the name of Hitler's foreignminister.Shvitser (Sweater): A boastful character who was actually a wind bag.In addition to all of these, there were others which were faintly derogatory, andwhich designated people by the locales they had come from, such as:64Leisure Activitiesthe Jews of Chrzanow for many years. Thousands of Chrzanow Jews went to theriver to perform the tashlich ceremony on Rosh Hashanah. Willow branches for Suk-koth came from the banks of the river. Jewish housewives waited by the river for pea-sant women to come on market days, so that they could get a bargain on a chickenfor Sabbath or for the kapore ceremony before Yom Kippur. A number of Jews lived atthe Piaski. A Jewish tannery was located there, and people felt more secure therethan in the forest. The Chrzanow youth spread their wings, finding a sandy spot andbathing just as if they were at an elegant beach.But the old magic of the forest was missing. The very fact that the forest had to besurrendered to newcomers discouraged the youth. To spite their enemies, theyoung men and women of Chrzanow refused to give up entirely. Although theywere originally forced to the Piaski, they made it their own. Herded about, first bythe Poles and then into the ghetto by the Germans, the young people gathered at thePiaski, and in summer evenings the sound of Yiddish and Hebrew songs could beheard. They sang from the heart, with hopes for a better future.The Piaski remained the only place for strolling outdoors during the German oc-cupation. Then its cheerful atmosphere faded away altogether, as some of the youngpeople were already in forced work camps. Only occasionally did individuals gothere, along with small groups of 'politicians/' looking forward to some news ofthe outside world. Now the secret may be revealed: the town's "Jewish radio" waslocated at the Piaski. It was the source of illegal news during Hitler's war—news thathelped to keep hope of redemption alive.NICKNAMES IN CHRZANOWUnfortunately not all can be translated effectively—Publisher.In Chrzanow nicknames were used as if they were entirely natural. According toolder Jews from Chrzanow, the nicknames began because once upon a time, whenthe railroad station was still at the old Station Street, young people would wait forthe arrival of every new bridegroom from out of town, and express their opinion ofhim. Of course there were always jokers among them, and after the "evaluation" ofthe new member of the community, they would assign him an appropriatenickname. To a certain extent these nicknames were individually earned—somereferred to one's occupation; others expressed physical qualities, while still othershad to do with the owner's character.Today it is hard to give an accurate philological account of these nicknames, eventhough in its time each one was appropriate. Following are a few examples:Bobe (Grandmother): He had no beard, or it was barely visible.Budke (Booth): His store consisted of a stall of boards nailed together.Baal-Shem (Saint): A Jew who dealt in old clothes and rags; quite learned, couldresolve difficult points of observance, and because of his modest bearing hewas called a saint.Bas (Bass): A musician who played this instrument.63Chrzanowtheir heads awkwardly and blushing as they did so. Once upon a time, speaking to agirl was not taken lightly in Chrzanow. It took both courage and a bit of audacity.People took into consideration those who might be watching, and even more so thegirls themselves, who might go bearing tales later on. In the earlier years, the Plantnserved as a sort of passageway to the suspension bridge. As a rule Chasidic mothersand fathers did not permit their grown children to go out strolling unaccompaniedby those older and more experienced. But the young people always found excuses,saying that they had to meet someone at the railroad station, or see someone off.However, the real goal was the suspension bridge. In addition to students from thestudy house, young people of every sort, from every class and estate, boys as well asgirls, gathered there. Of course, the boys and girls were in separate groups.At the beginning of the twentieth century, when the socialist and nationalist youthorganizations were established, the Plantn changed radically. The young peoplebegan reading fiction, both good and bad. They became bolder, and a short timelater both accidental and arranged rendezvous began to take place, as is the moderncustom. The Plantn and the free air also influenced the spirits of the youth.THE FORESTFor the modern youth, aspiring to freedom, these areas had become too narrow,too stuffy. They set off for the forest nearest to the city, about one kilometer awayfrom the Jewish cemetery. Until 1918, the forest was the ideal spot for the moremature Jewish youth. Here they weren't afraid of their strict mothers and fathers.They were also safe from the all-seeing eyes of God's spies and everyday gossips,who were always seeking new material.In the forest the youth passed their time free and unconstrained, but their be-havior was cultured and respectable. "Love affairs," Platonic and romantic, werecarried out on an elevated level. Intelligent, informed discussions were held ongeneral as well as Jewish topics, about the newest creations of that shining period inYiddish, Hebrew, Polish, and German literature. If trees could speak, they wouldhave much to relate about the young people of Chrzanow. Achad HaAm and MaxNordau, Peretz and Nietzsche, Bialik and Mickiewicz were read in their originallanguages.With the collapse of Austria everything in the forest changed for the worse. Alocomotive factory was established and a workers' dormitory was built in the forest.The local Poles began to harass the young Jews in various ways, eventually resortingto physical attacks and stone throwing. This embittered the Jewish youth, fillingthem with hatred for the grandchildren of Kosciuszko and Mickiewicz.These frequent aggressions led the Jewish youth to seek another place to relax.Thus they spent the last several years before the catastrophe at the piaski (sands).PIASKIThis was a pretty spot near the river Hechlo, which had played a part in the lives of62Leisure ActivitiesPLACES FOR AMUSEMENT AND STROLLING-(The Synagogue "Bobowianka" Lawn and the Polish Bridge)CHASIDIC JEWS occupied the so-called Synagogue Lawn as far as the slaughter-house, and from the Polish Bridge lengthwise from the railroad station to thecemetery. Within those boundaries on summer evenings one could see respectableJews in black overcoats with wide silk belts, long pipes in their mouths and carryingsticks as protection, taking in the fresh air from the surrounding woods, a blessingwhich Chrzanow enjoyed in plenty.Usually the evening strolls of our fathers, Chasidim and scholars, were a continua-tion of the rambles they had just taken through the Talmud and law codes. Theirminds were still mulling over the material they had learned in the course of the day.Naturally, when they began to breathe the fresh air, they sometimes permittedthemselves to speak about lighter matters, such as pithy sayings or interestingparables attributed to Chasidic rebes.Young men who studied at the study house delved deeply into the particulars ofthe material they were working on. Women wearing hair bands and wigs settledmodestly on the lawn, chatting about their daily concerns, sometimes throwing in abit of gossip as well. When a male had to pass, the women withdrew to one side, sothat he wouldn't be forced to pass between two females.In fact the synagogue lawn was quite overgrown, both literally and with theJewish life of Chrzanow. Before Passover, it was the place to light fires to burn one'sleavened goods (Chometz). Here Jewish children from the nearby municipal Hebrewschool played games of nuts, and on Lag Baomer the youthful troops fought battleswith bow and arrow. On the Ninth of Av pranksters took burrs from the lawn to allof the study houses and Chasidic synagogues, to torment the worshipers during therecitation of the laments for the destruction of the Temple. On Yom Kippur Jews whowere beginning to suffer from the odors of the melting candles in the mainsynagogue and the other houses of worship came out onto the lawn wearing theirtaleisim to get a bit of fresh air.Although the lawn belonged to a Gentile, the Jews considered it their own.Despite the owner's protests, they felt as if they were in their own father's vineyard.For younger people seeking pleasure, there were the Plantn (Alea Henryka) andthe suspension bridge near the railroad station. There the atmosphere was freer andthe mood lighter, as the spiritual realm gave way to the material. Young men permit-ted themselves a glance at young ladies, and sometimes even greeted them, nodding61ChrzanowSchwartz, the leader of Gordonia in Chrzanow.This picture of the Jewish students of Chrzanow would not be complete withoutmentioning a small, closed group of older scholars, who actually did not study inChrzanow, but who came home on vacation each year. These included the talented,serious and very intelligent Heniek Rieser (who became a doctor and engineer inMilan), the "Casanova” and prankster Heniek Nadel (in Shanghai), the brothersYosef and Dovid Bachner, both engineers (in Canada), the rebellious son of theChrzanow magnate Reb Zisme Kinreich, Boruch (later a doctor of economics inBerlin), and the extraordinary student and joker Yukl Kurtz. They looked down atthe younger students, as if they were talking to puppies, to use Yukl Kurtz' words.When they came from "outside" to Chrzanow, they kept to themselves, speakingabout theatre and about new books, attracting youngsters and mocking them end-lessly.In the 1930s the distance between the "Plantn Jews" and the "city Jews" began tolessen, and the students changed as well, becoming more imbued with sensitivityand involvement with Jewish national problems.60Jewish Students in Chrzanowthe matsheyavke before I entered the synagogue.I always went to pray in the little synagogue at the Plantn, where my father b/mwas the secretary for many years. I can still feel the warmth and hospitality that sur-rounded me there on winter Sabbath afternoons, before the afternoon prayers. Agroup of Jews sat around a table, listening to a lesson in Talmud taught by the well-known scholar Reb Shachne him. Around the iron stove sat prominent elders,serious and preoccupied during the week, but today with cheerful, calm smiles ontheir faces. They chatted of politics, dissecting Itshele's "Political Letter" and Kipnis's"Over a Glass of Tea." (Itshele and Kipnis were famous commentators at the time.)While there, I forgot about the meaningless world of the student, forgot about thepiercing remarks of the anti-Semitic Polish professors, and the mockery of my Gen-tile comrades. There one was surrounded by an unforced, free atmosphere, and anintimate Jewish warmth informed by the light but sharp wisdom of the synagogue.During the years after World War I, the Jewish students numbered around forty-five or fifty. As assimilation increased, they became distanced from Jewish nationalsentiment, and empty arrogance reigned among the Jewish students of Chrzanow.They were ashamed to speak Yiddish or to find themselves in the company of Jews;it wasn't befitting for them to go to the speeches organized by the hard-workingZionist organizations. After they finished their homework, they strolled back andforth on the Plantn with nothing to do. They flirted with girls, lay around on the hillsor by the river, and sat listening to the concert of frogs, speaking of football or idlyjoking until late at night.The efficient Zionist student organization in Cracow tried to make some headwayin the provinces and establish cells in the smaller cities. The Polish Jewishnewspaper Noivy Dziennik published inspiring articles by our beloved leaders, theunforgettable Dr. Tohn, Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart, and Dr. Berklamer, who stormedagainst the indifference and passivity of the provincial intelligentsia, trying to forcetheir way into the closed minds of our provincial Jewish students.Certainly some of our students in Chrzanow were sensitive to the ideas of thetime. Hershl Brener certainly wasn't one of the' 'Plantn crowd.'' A boy who had beento cheder and had a good mind, he would sneak off into the Libianzer woods earlyevery morning with Marx's Capital under his arm. Izak Daytsher with his offbeatsensibility later became a talented journalist in Warsaw. Yosek Bester from the villageof Lipovice, a pitifully poor child of the countryside, later became a popular doctor intown. The socially conscious Chane Dunkelblum, the sisters Wolf and the com-mitted Zionist youth leader Rose Orenstein also belonged to this group, as did IdekVemer, the intelligent Chrzanow youth who became a lawyer. Izak Reifer, who onlybegan to devote his youthful enthusiasm to socialist community work after he com-pleted gymnasium, made his way to New Zealand after finishing the Politechni-kum, where he occupied a government position and worked as a scholar. I also wantto mention my friend Yosek Bochner, a brilliant mathematician, who later studied inBerlin and went to Moscow, where he worked in an airplane factory. There was alsoa seminary in which about fifteen Jewish girls studied, several of whom took activepart in Zionist organizations. Among the latter was the unforgettable Chava59Jewish Students in Chrzan6wby Engineer S. SchwartzLIKE EVERY Polish town, Chrzanow had its Jewish students. The Jewish Enlighten-ment had been at work in nearby Cracow for quite some time, and the spirit of prog-ress began to seep into neighboring Chrzanow.While still under Austrian rule, Chrzanow had possessed a gymnasium and in itsstreets, as in the rest of Austria, the students strode about proudly in their blackuniforms and tall hats, with gold stripes on the collars of their jackets.True, even before the gymnasium was established a few families, such as theSchwartzbarts, the Cyfers, the Riesers, sent their children away from Chrzanow tostudy. They did not belong to the student circles of Chrzanow.Later, Jewish students were recruited from among the families who lived on thePlantn. Called the "Plantn people," or the "better class," they lived in fine apart-ments, dressed in "German" (that is, modern) clothing, employed Polish servants,sent their children to secular schools, generally spoke Polish with them, andgenerally aspired to have well-educated children. The parents were religious, buttolerant. The mothers went to the synagogue on the Sabbath and on holidays justlike everyone else, behaved like Jewish women, maintained Jewish customs. Thefathers were well-respected merchants, who had even worn shtreimelech at first,which they later exchanged for modern European hats. They sent their sons toCheder, and saw to it that they studied well. On the Sabbath they examined theirchildren to be sure that they had thoroughly learned the Torah portion of the week.If the children studied diligently, they were rewarded, but when they didn't learntheir lessons thoroughly, the Sabbath was ruined. Fiery slaps found their mark morethan once. The shouts of the father mixed with the weeping of the children could beheard in the street.When the children finished the fourth or fifth grade of elementary school, theparents usually decided to send them to the gymnasium. The fathers, however, onlyagreed on condition that the melamdim would come to the house after school andtutor the children in Jewish subjects. Thus the parents were confident that theirchildren would be respectable in the eyes of both God and society.At first the Jewish students were excused from gymnasium on the Sabbath, so thatthey could join their fathers in prayer. Later, when the gymnasium was run by thePolish state, the Jewish students had to come on the Sabbath, but they were not forcedto write. Nevertheless they had to wear the student's matsheyavke on their heads,and many parents were embarrassed when their children came to services wearingmatsheyavkes. I remember keeping another cap in my pocket and exchanging it for58The Jewish Nationalist Movementpolitical and social life of Chrzanow. But in the last years before the Holocaust twoother parties came as well which, although they played a major role on the globalscale, were hardly significant in Chrzanow. These were the Agudat Yisroel and theRevisionists. While they had a fair number of members, they had little influence onpublic opinion.We should also mention the Anski Drama Club, which was apolitical, and a sourceof true Jewish culture and secular knowledge.It is also worth noting that despite the various differences of opinion among theparties, there were never any serious conflicts or personal rivalries in Chrzanow. Onthe contrary: the young people of every tendency lived together in friendship. It wastruly an ideal to which one should look up.57ChrzanowBut in fact, the “Rachel" society actually did preparatory work for all of the Jewishnationalist parties. It awakened national consciousness among the Jewish women ata time when assimilationism and pietism combined to combat the national con-sciousness of the Jewish people.Cadres of women sympathetic to Jewish nationalism and members of WIZO wereamong the products of this society.The "Rachel" society was unique to Chrzanow. Its members were recruited fromamongst various classes and segments of the population. Its leaders, as far as we canremember, were: Libe Klein; Chayetshe Lezer, later Koral; Faygush Gasner, laterFishier; Yocheved Dunkelblum, later Haftl; Malke Rosenbaum, later Klein; and thesisters Zajac.MIZRACHIMizrachi was virtually the last of the Zionist parties to be established, although in acity as religious and pious as Chrzanow, it should have been the first. On the otherhand, Mizrachi's task was much easier, because the ground had already beenprepared for Zionism by the other parties. Zionist fund-raising was already func-tioning well, and many people longed to go to Erets Israel. Mizrachi served as a lineof defense against the Agudat Yisroel, which promoted an uncompromising anti-Zionist line. And though its numbers were not large, Mizrachi grew into an influen-tial force with which the Zionist parties had to reckon. Its moral influence on other-wise uninvolved religious Jews grew steadily, thanks to its charismatic activists,such as Avrom Zilbiger and Betsalel Cuker, the latter of whom later played such abitter and tragic role. Other activists were Yechezkl Reich, Chaim Hirshtal, ChaimGutter (all victims of the Nazis) and, may he enjoy long life, Baruch Hirshberg.These experienced activists devoted all of their energy to the Zionist idea.One of the finest accomplishments of the Mizrachi was the maintenance of itssynagogue on the Plantrt. In addition to Zionist activists, the place was frequentedby a group of music students devoted to Reb Hirsh Leyb and Reb Leybish Mayzeles'musical works, such as Avrom Zilbiger, Simcha Shenberg, Berl Frankel, and others.Prayers were sung with musical competence and piety. It was sheer pleasure to wor-ship at the Mizrachi synagogue on the Sabbath or on holidays; every comer was filledwith wonderful melodies.Mizrachi was also the first group in Chrzanow to introduce the custom of holdingmodern Sabbath parties, following the example of Chaim Nachman Bialik's Sabbathparties. It was delightful to observe Jews in their shtreimelech and Sabbath garmentsdiscussing contemporary issues between hymns, or listening to the variousspeeches that were given.Mizrachi also established a youth group called Hashomer Hadati (the ReligiousGuards). However, this group's achievements were unimpressive in comparisonwith those of other Zionist youth organizations, especially Akiba.We have tried to give a brief account of the most prominent movements in the56The Jewish Nationalist Movementovercame every obstacle. Energy, patience, and stubbornness on the part of theLabor Zionists strengthened the organization at a time when the Bund ruled thehearts and minds of a large number of workers.In a short while the Labor Zionists, thanks to their energetic activist MordechaiShor, the two brothers Blitzer, Chaim Wiener and, first and foremost, the eternallyyouthful Motl Rosner ml hi a, began to make headway among the workers. Their fre-quent meetings, speeches, and entertainments brought new life to town. Thanks tothe Labor Zionists and their activities on behalf of Jewish culture in general,Chrzanow soon was graced with such world-famous guest speakers as Dr. NatanBimbaum (Matisyohu Akhar), Dr. Chaim Zhitlowsky and Dr. Yitschok Schiper.Zionist labor leaders such as Berl Loker, Leah Chazanowitsh, and (Casriel) NachmanMifelev were frequent guests among the Labor Zionists of Chrzanow.Although stagnation was the general rule among the Jewish parties during the waryears 1914-1918, since some of the young men were at the front fighting for theAustrian empire, others were serving with the military behind the lines, and manyremained “neutral" in attics and cellars—nevertheless the Labor Zionists ofChrzanow did not stop working. Motl Rosner, who was the ideologue and, for all in-tents and purposes, the leader of the Labor Zionists after Mordechai Shor's depar-ture for America, strengthened the party's work. The group known as Frayhayt wastransformed in later years into a Zionist pioneering movement, led by AvromTagner, who emigrated to Palestine a short time before the Holocaust.After the split between Left and Right Labor Zionism, the group known as Unityreigned in Chrzanow thanks to the activities of the well-known Hebrew teacherMenachem him. The socialist Zionist idea took hold among ever-widening circles ofthe working class, thanks in large measure to the intelligence and dedication of theleading comrades of Unity, such as Yechezkl Guter, Berek Laufer, and Izak Urbach.After World War I, this labor Zionist group provided the largest number of Zionistpioneers, and in the last years before the Holocaust, a youth group named Gordoniawas established, by the active Unity member Yakov Forst. This group was veryhelpful in spreading the pioneering spirit among the young people of Chrzanow,thanks to whom quite a number managed to get out in time.RACHELThis girls' society in Chrzanow only existed from about 1910 until 1914, and itsprecise nature cannot be delineated. Actually the group was not connected to any ofthe Jewish parties but was, rather, an artificially created umbrella group, beneathwhich Enlightenment tendencies took shelter. In the conditions which obtained atthat time, it was worthwhile in itself for daughters of Chasidic homes, of piousfathers and mothers, to have the chance to come together in their own space, in athoroughly Jewish atmosphere, to hear lectures about Jewish and general literatureand Jewish current affairs. This alone was a real gain for these Jewish girls, who weredestined to bring up the next Jewish generation.55Chrzanowwho arranged various cultural productions and also supplied the young people withYiddish literature.The Bund's appearance among the Jewish public in Chrzanow caused a stormyreaction on the part of the pious Chasidic masses. The latter were not acquaintedwith the movement's goals, and saw the Bund as attempting to destroy Judaism andlead the youth away from the true path. But the reaction of the Chasidim, who laterresponded in force, was not really aimed against the Bund; rather, it was primarily anatural agitation against progressive tendencies, against the "little Gentiles'' whodidn't want to obey the good and pious people. The Bund, through its open hostilityto traditional Judaism, only summoned the wolf from the forest. It became thescapegoat for a major offensive carried out by the pious Jews of Chrzanow one Sab-bath in the summer of 1905.One Friday afternoon the Bund displayed a sign announcing that on the afternoonof the Sabbath, a speaker from Cracow would be present. (Apparently this was Dr.Bros.) The rabbi, Reb Naftoli, countered this with an announcement that peoplewere to assemble and forbid this desecration of the Sabbath. After the Sabbath meal,crowds of Jews in their Sabbath garments streamed to the assembly area in front ofthe synagogue, foregoing their accustomed Sabbath nap. A. large demonstrationbegan at the synagogue and went to Krzyska Street, where Bund headquarters werelocated. When they arrived at the locked headquarters, the rabbi and the crowdstopped. In the rabbi's presence, one man in the crowd broke through a windowand threw out everything he could lay his hands on—books, newspapers, and cor-respondence. He also came upon a postcard bearing information concerning thetime of the speaker's arrival. With such clear evidence, the rabbi and the entirecrowd set off for the train station. (Here they had to wear their kerchiefs around theirnecks, because they were outside the boundaries within which they were permittedto carry objects during the Sabbath.) The speaker arrived at the station and unwit-tingly fell into the crowd of Chasidim, who gave him a thorough thrashing, beatinghim mercilessly and piercing him with pins they had brought from home. He wasbarely recognizable when they were through with him.The epilogue of this incident, played out in court, is unimportant for our purposes.But two elements are indeed worth noting. One is the decisiveness and aggressive-ness of the zealous defenders of religious Judaism and especially of their leaders,Reb Shloyme Naiman, Tall Yoske, and others, who rightfully or wrongfully threwthemselves into the battle. On the other hand was the calm behavior of the youth atthat time, who avoided physical arguments throughout that period of hot debate.LABOR ZIONISTSAt first the Socialist Zionist workers' movement had difficulty establishing itselffirmly in Chrzanow, since the Bund had already captured the loyalty of a significantportion of the working class. It was even harder to take on the Bund's talentedleaders, Herman Heifer and Nachman Shneyder. But the power of the Zionist idea54The Jewish Nationalist MovementHall,” which took place on winter Saturday evenings in the large room at LeybischKlein's house, where well-known Zionists from Cracow, such as Dr. Shimon Feld-blum. Dr. Bulva, Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart, Dr. Chaim Hilfshtein and others came togive lectures.Some 30 plus years later, the first pioneers left the ranks of the Bnai Zion inChrzanow for Erets Israel, carrying Herzl's Jewish State in their packs. They led theway toward realizing Zionism, even though they were the children of well-to-doparents. They were the avant-garde of the several hundred Chrzanow Jews wholater emigrated and thus saved themselves from Hitler's Hell and slaughter. HershlKlein, Shimon Volf Yungervirt and Shloyme Guter—these Enlighteners and kolpak-bachurim had enough sense and courage to forge a better future for the Jewish people.After the departure of these first members of Bnai Zion, the work did notdiminish; on the contrary, it increased in intensity. Thanks to the effective andenergetic Zionist work of its members, such as the tragically murdered Lipe Wiener,Hershl Bochenek, Kalmen Proper and Moyshe Leyzer Wachsberg (Pidele), Bnai Zionalways took the lead in all of the Zionist institutions, such as the Jewish NationalFund, the Jewish Foundation Fund, and the rest of the national and Zionist under-takings.After World War I, thanks to the establishment of the general Zionist youthorganization Akiba, which acted as a transfusion of new blood on the older Zionists,Bnai Zion became even more lively. Hebrew teachers were brought to town, andthanks to the tireless Zionist activist Aron Grajower, served their people faithfullyuntil their tragic death. May these few lines serve as a monument to them.THE BUNDIn fairness, we must admit that the Jewish Socialist Party, as it was originallycalled—later known as the Bund—at first displayed impressive and moving activismin Chrzanow. There were two reasons for this. First, there was strong support fromthe Polish Socialist Party, which was then at the height of its strength, and whichboasted its popular Galician tribune, Daszinski and Marek in Western Galicia andDiamant and Liberman in Eastern Galicia. These men enjoyed extraordinarypopularity among the working masses. The second reason was more important. Agroup of socialist idealists, fanatically intense fighters and competent, intelligentChrzanow organizers, including the major Bundist activists Nachman Shneyder,Herman Heifer, and later Sholem Goldshtein, filled in the gaps in the Bund as aJewish movement with their own personal acts, sense of life, and faith in socialism.It wasn’t the Bund as an ideological movement that was successful in Chrzanow.However, until the Zionist parties appeared on the scene, the leaders of the Bundistparty managed to gather around themselves certain parts of the Jewish population.Undeniably, the Bund was the first group to bring a bit of light to the oppressed ar-tisans of Chrzanow. This was accomplished more in the spiritual than in theeconomic realm. The Bundist activists were the first to bring delegates from Cracow,53Chrzanowof the education these parents gave their children.These two families gave Jewish Chrzanow two brilliant personalities of whom thecity was justly proud: Dr. Shmuel Cyfer and Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart. Although thelatter took no major part in the development of the youth organizations ofChrzanow, they served as an example of national pride and Zionist enthusiasm in atime of deeply-entrenched political and cultural assimilation, which touched a largeportion of our people.THE FIRST ZIONIST SOCIETYReb Leybl Cyfer also deserved credit for having the initiative to be among thefounders of the first Zionist organization in Chrzanow after the publication ofHerzl's The Jewish State. This group consisted of Enlighteners and Torah Jews whoraised money for the settlement of Erets Israel, working under strictly conspiratorialconditions. In order to avoid attracting the attention of all the various rebes of thetime, who suspected Zionism of heresy, those true idealists continued their workuntil the youth took over the Zionist idea and carried it into the open. The names ofthe first Zionist pioneers may be recorded here for posterity:Reb Leybl Cyfer Reb Mordechai (Saul) SchwartzbartReb Yehoshua Holander Reb Ziml ShternfeldReb Shimen Biderman Reb Shabsay VurtselThe minutes book of this first Zionist society in Chrzanow was, until 1939, in thepossession of Boruch Holander, who died in Auschwitz.BNAI ZION(General Zionists)Quiet, modest, without noise or tumult, were the beginnings of the first purelyHerzlian Zionist society, Bnai Zion. If we are not mistaken, this group was created inan attic room in Eliezer Boruch's house across from the community building (themagistrate). Conspiracy was a necessity because the first comrades of the Bnai Zionwere "silk and satin," youth from the privileged classes. They were students of theTalmud who had left their studies and wore silk coats and kolpakes—a sable shtreimelwhich the Chasidic youth used to wear on the Sabbath. Since they had no trade toearn a living, they lived at the mercy of their pious fathers, and their dependence ontheir parents forced them to be discreet. Most of all, however, they were well-raisedchildren who did not want to cause their parents any unnecessary anguish. On theother hand, their love of Zion was genuine and hot, full of enthusiasm and commit-ment.This initially small circle eventually developed into a significant pleiad of con-scious Zionist activists, who carried out thoroughgoing nationalish and Zionistpropaganda activities. Their forum for these activities was the so-called "Toynbee52The Jewish Nationalist MovementIN ORDER to describe the activities of the modern nationalist and socialistmovements in our city, we must first return for a moment to the age of the JewishEnlightenment. Although the Jewish Enlightenment was not directly related tothese movements, to a certain extent it laid the groundwork for their developmentby producing talented individuals, who later served the political organizations.It should immediately be mentioned that the Jewish Enlightenment foundrelatively little sympathy in Chrzanow. The movement did not inspire the same self-sacrificing enthusiasm in our city as in the rest of Poland, or in the Russian Pale ofSettlement, where love of secular culture was an overwhelming passion. In thoseregions this passion demanded many young Jewish sacrificial victims, who lost theirhealth and became tubercular in the brutal conditions in which Jewish students livedat the time. The lack of involvement may perhaps be explained by the fact thatChrzanow was located close to the centers of culture. Since no particular restrictionswere placed on Jews, and since they could eat openly the fruit of the Tree ofKnowledge, the evil impulse had less influence and the passion lost its sharp edge.Only a few individuals permitted their children to be students at the end of the lastcentury. Interestingly, these Jews were not "secular." The fathers of the future doc-tors and lawyers were pious men with beards and peyes, who wore Chasidicclothing, shtreimelech, and silk overcoats. They had certainly never missed an after-noon or evening prayer in their lives, nor had they failed to pour water over theirfingertips when they arose in the morning.We would like to name here two of these citizens of our town who, in letting theirchildren study, were motivated by Enlightenment impulses and Jewish nationalistambitions in addition to practical material considerations. The first was Reb LeyblCyfer along with his wife Fannie, who gave Dr. Shmuel Cyfer to our city, and inwhose house the first Zionist circle in Chrzanow had its earliest meetings. The sec-ond was Reb Mordechai Shaul and his wife Chane Schwartzbart, whose childrenwere among the first Zionists in Western Galicia—not to mention their son Itzchak,the future Sejm deputy. They raised their children not only in the spirit of theEnlightenment, but first and foremost in the nationalist Jewish spirit. The eldest son.Engineer Dr. Joseph Schwartzbart, who lived in Bruenn (Czech territory), was apioneer of Zionist thought and developed strong Zionist activities. He died in Israel.Their second son. Dr. Aron (Adolf) Schwartzbart, a well-known medical expert andactive Zionist, lived in Tel-Aviv. Their only daughter. Dr. Eli Rieger, was a professorin the teachers' seminary in Tel-Aviv. These details demonstrate the Zionist character51ChrzanowTHE BURIAL SOCIETYRemarkably, none of the foregoing institutions had as much independent author-ity as the burial society. Nevertheless the burial society was organized on ademocratic basis—the trustees were elected according to the old Jewish system ofcasting lots, so that every single member had an equal say in the outcome of the elec-tions. The acceptance of a new member into the burial society was not a simple matter.First of all, the applicant really had to deserve to be a member of the society. Powerand money had nothing to do with it—moral purity, honesty, and genuine fear ofGod were the main criteria for any candidate.The trustees of the burial society were responsible first, for maintaining thecemetery; second, for distributing burial plots; and third, for arranging funerals.Since the burial society had no other source of income, it had to charge a fee forburial plots. Thus there were frequent disputes between the families of the deceasedand the society's trustees, who had to be absolutely aboveboard and honest in theirfinancial dealings. They only took money from those who had it and could afford topay. Larger sums were also taken from those who had been reluctant to give to charitywhen they were alive, whereas poor people were not charged at all.The secretaries needed to exercise tact in the distribution of plots. Such decisionshad nothing to do with the deceased's wealth or power. The burial society was in the"true world." The rich man and the poor man were equal, and the secretaries refusedto be influenced by the children or the more distant relatives of the dead. If thedeceased had earned an outstanding burial plot during her or his life, then it wasgranted. To the credit of the Jews of Chrzanow, the burial society was always runappropriately, and misdeeds were few. The secretaries' power was indeed unlimited,but their morality was beyond reproach.50Philanthropic InstitutionsOut of the money collected from voluntary monthly payments, the society distrib-uted medicine, and often paid the doctors for their treatment of poor sick people.Medical instruments were also loaned to those who could not pay for them.This institution was something for which the Gentile neighbors could really envy us.THE SOCIETY FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF PREGNANT WOMENIn our age of modern hospitals things are much easier for pregnant women. Ourmothers and grandmothers had it a bit harder—especially the poor among them.Although women had more children in earlier times, and a birth was nothingunusual, still it was a more important family event than it is today. Jewish women ac-tively participated in earning a living, and many simply didn't have any time toprepare themselves for the big event. While on their way to fairs, or standing in theirstores, they began to feel labor pains. As they lay in labor, Jewish women often lackedeven a bit of cereal to keep body and soul together, let alone enough to prepare forthe circumcision feast or the redemption of the firstborn son. In these circumstancesthe Society for the Assistance of Pregnant Women rendered valuable assistance,delegating its female members to visit the women in childbirth and help them in anyway possible.Among the activists in this society, Mrs. Yocheved Wiener and Mrs. Fannie Cyfershould be mentioned. These women who were so dedicated to the community alsolaid the foundation for the future branch of WIZO, the Women's InternationalZionist Organization.WIZOWIZO in Chrzanow wrote one of the finest chapters regarding philanthropic andsocial activities in town. It was directed by educated women, with Mrs. Rieser at theirhead, and had significant achievements to its credit. First of all, thanks to their in-telligence and education, the founders of WIZO took a modem, practical attitudetoward every problem of the Jewish woman and the Jewish child. WIZO had roomfor women from every tendency, from the conservative Chasidim to the progressiveZionists, even including assimilationist circles. Goodwill toward everyone reignedin this organization, and this goodwill brought together people of opposing views,such as the above-mentioned Mrs. Rieser and the conservative, Chasidic, but highlyintelligent and refined Mrs. Zajac (widow of Reb Jecheskiel Zajac).The best and most refined women of Chrzanow belonged to this organization. Weneed not list all of the social accomplishments of WIZO, since everyone fromChrzanow is quite familiar with this list. However, worthy of special note is the idea,which originated with WIZO, of establishing an orphanage solely for Jewishchildren. With great difficulty, a fine building was erected in the late 30's for this pur-pose. To our great sorrow, the children could not long enjoy this wonderful gift.WIZO was also the first Jewish women's organization to set itself the task of reliev-ing distress without regard to party or class. Perhaps this was the main reason for itssuccess and popularity in our town.49Chrzanowpeople who had just arrived in town, enabling them to avoid sleeping on the hardbenches of the study house or the Chasidic synagogues, and avoid freezing inwinter. Reb Usher Stem b/m, a childless and warm-hearted Jew, was the founder ofthis "hotel." When a Jew arrived in the city, all he had to do was ask for the secretaryof the free shelter. When he received a pass, he was sure of a safe place to stay—witha glass of tea thrown in.THE SUPPORTERS OF THE POORThis institution, founded by Reb Henoch Timberg b/m, had two tasks. First, itdealt with the masses of wandering paupers who came to town and went fromhouse to house asking for alms, many of whom treated the residents of the city veryrudely. The Supporters of the Poor gave these people "travel expenses," so thatthey could continue on to other Jewish communities, and leave the burghers ofChrzanow alone. Second, it benefited weak or elderly paupers who had difficultymaking the rounds of the houses, as well as those who were afraid to beg actively.The initiators of the Society had the best intentions, but as a practical matter it didn'twork because the paupers were smarter. They both accepted' 'travel expenses,'' andbegged. In the last years before the war, this society dissolved more or less of its ownaccord.THE TIFERES BOCHURIMAlthough this society was little known, and hence not very popular among thepublic, it had a good influence on the young men who studied at the Study House.The society's goal, if the expression is appropriate, was "mutual aid." Amidst thecommotion of everyday life, the young men looked after their poorer comrades.When a poor young man got married, he received money toward the wedding ex-penses. On occasion respected Jews also turned to the society for assistance. Thesociety mobilized young men who went out in groups across the city, and gatheredmoney for the needy, yet embarrassed poor.THE SOCIETY FOR VISITING THE SICKOur parents always had the best intentions, wanting to help out, whatever thesituation. Unfortunately, they did not always take the proper approach, and some-times the necessary conditions were not met. Although this society was run accordingto the same stale, outmoded conceptions as in other Jewish towns, it performed auseful function.The society's first task was to stay with seriously ill people at night. The secretarywas responsible for seeing to it that appropriate companions were sent for the in-valid in question. Voluntary discipline was the rule in this respect. Rarely did some-one refuse to spend the night at another's home.48Philanthropic InstitutionsTHE FREE LOAN SOCIETYAMONG THE Jewish philanthropic institutions that were active in the city, the firstthat deserves mention was the free loan society.The initiative for creating this useful institution came from the Kamienica family.Its founder and long-time secretary was the famous and wealthy philanthropist RebEli Rauchwerger him. The free loan society benefited householders and merchantswho were down on their luck, rather than out-and-out paupers. Its activity waslimited to the distribution of interest-free loans in exchange for collateral which theclients entrusted to the society.This fine and genuinely beneficent society was thoroughly Jewish, lacking the ex-aggerated bureaucracy that appeared later in many of the Jewish national banks. Forinstance, if a Jew needed money to make up his daughter's dowry, he went to thesecretary of the free loan society with whatever jewelry he possessed, and thetrustee loaned him as much as the collateral was worth, more or less. More than onceit happened that the same Jew would go to the secretary of the society on the day ofthe wedding, and say, "Dear Reb Eli, listen. I'm ashamed to walk up to the weddingcanopy without my gold watch and chain which I've left with you as collateral, andmy wife would also like to have her gold earrings until after the wedding." And RebEli, or whichever one of the secretaries was approached, believed him and loanedthe items back out. The Jew was honest, and brought back the items right after thewedding, leaving them until "God" helped him and he was able to redeem them.THE OLD AGE HOMEDespite the high and humane standards set by the original promoter of this worthyidea, nevertheless the city of Chrzanow was sadly neglectful in this area. It is simplyincomprehensible that in such a thoroughly Jewish city, with a sufficient sensitivityfor social institutions, so little was done for the weakest and loneliest in our midst,the elderly men and women who, lacking children, were doomed to enter this in-stitution. To say it was "neglected" is to put the case very mildly.THE FREE SHELTERThe initiative displayed by our fathers and grandfathers in their search for gooddeeds to perform may well be wondered at. This truly useful institution aided poor47Chrzanowsidelocks, and had his wife put on a wig. He traveled to see rebes, and in generalbecame a strictly religious and pious Jew. This Dr. Julius Feifer later became the mainleader, theoretician, and propagandist of the Machzikei Limud movement (some-what similar to the Salvation Army). The Machzikei Limud did not get involved innational politics as a party, nor did it have anything to do with the Jewish nationalistrenaissance or the struggles for social justice. It limited itself to keeping the youthtrue to Torah and faith, using modem methods. In addition to the various lessons inBible with Rashi, Ein Yakov, Prophets and Writings, a lending library with Polish,German, and especially Yiddish books was established—books that had previouslybeen censored, on suspicion that they might contain heretical ideas. Members of thesociety also produced full-scale theatrical performances. The Machzikei Limud alsoorganized religious services at their party headquarters, where the young peopleprayed together on the Sabbath, holidays, and also on weekdays. In this fashion acollective religious and traditional spirit was inculcated. Reb Jecheskiel Zajac, whohas been described previously, played a significant role in the development of thelocal Machzikei Limud, as did Mendl Ashkenazi, who was blessed with organiza-tional talents. The Machzikei Limud in Chrzanow was the only organization inGalicia that existed for over thirty years without interruption.BEIS YAKOVAs in almost every Polish city, a Beis Yakov school was established in Chrzanowafter World War I. Without doubt it was needed, and it came at just the right time.Although Chrzanow considered itself a pious and religious community, never-theless nothing was done to ensure the religious education of Jewish girls until thePeis Yakov was established. A kind of religious amnesia was the rule among theJewish girls of Chrzanow, even those raised in Chasidic families. This changeddramatically after the establishment of the Beis Yakov school. If we are not mistaken,it was thanks to the experienced community activist Yocheved Wiener, who had alarge role in shaping the model curriculum, that many progressive parents sent theirdaughters to the Beis Yakov school, where they received a Jewish education. TheBeis Yakov school indeed went a long way toward eliminating religious ignoranceamong Jewish girls.46The Educational Institutions of ChrzanowAs time passed, the Psalm Society began to offer classes in religious texts, butwithout losing its focus on Psalms. The society owed its good reputation to RebNoyech Holzer b/m, the director of studies. He was a Kabbalist and a remarkablescholar, and he continued teaching classes until he was quite elderly, even after losinghis sight. The last teacher in the Psalm Society was the excellent Talmud scholar andmoral exemplar, Reb Itshele Weitzenblum, m/b/a.All of the other societies, with their fine-sounding names, accomplished little,despite the best intentions of their founders and the sacrifice of the trustees. Butamong them are worth mentioning, along with their founders:1. Love of Torah. Classes there were taught by the scholars Reb Avrom HirshReifer, the selfless philanthropist Reb Moyshe Lipschitz, and the learned RebMendl Landau;2. The Eternal Light society, where the judge Reb Sholem Aba's was the teacher;3. The Tree of Life society, headed by the extraordinary scholar Reb ShachneHamerman;4. The Supporters of the Torah yeshiva, headed by Reb Nute Dayan; and5. The Crown of Torah yeshiva headed by the brilliant Talmud scholar Reb ChaimTobias.We should also mention the Buttercake society, where the greatest ignoramuses intown prayed. Classes in that society were taught by Reb Motele Kolomeyer, whowas a scholar, but very easy-going.Particularly important in the religious education of the young people of Chrzanowwere the Supporters of Study and the Beis Yakov—two institutions in which JewishChrzanow could take pride.MACHZIKEI LIMUD(Supporters of Study)This society had more luck and influence in Chrzanow than the others. A large-scale movement, with its own lecturers and large popular gatherings, it evenboasted its own press (The Religious Jewish Worker), along with a full complement ofthe tools of propaganda and instructions, thus providing a balance to the Bund andPoalei Zion. The newspaper was founded in the year 1906 with a goal of spreadingTorah and religious tradition among young artisans and commercial employees. Itsheadquarters were in Cracow. The Chrzanow chapter grew until in time it becamethe strongest of all of the local Machzikei Limud branches. It is worthwhile to ac-quaint ourselves with the history of this movement, its founders and leaders.In 1906-7 in Cracow, there was a Jewish lawyer named Dr. Julius Feifer. Like mostJewish lawyers at that time, he had relatively little to do with Jews and Judaism. Itwas even said that his connection to the Jewish people consisted of composing falseaccusations against Jews on behalf of his clients. However, one morning this lawyerwoke up from a bad dream (or was it a good dream) and decided to repent andbecome a good Jew. He threw away his non-kosher dishes, grew a Jewish beard and45Chrzanowbooks, clothing, and food.Nevertheless the school could not withstand the passive resistance, the silent banimposed by the Jews of Chrzanow. Its teachers, for the most part half-assimilated,half-apostate Jews, could not earn the trust of the pious population. For the fewyears of its sad existence the school attracted only poor students, and aftervegetating for a few years, it had to close its doors. It left no trace of its existencebehind in Chrzanow.THE REGULAR STUDY GROUPThe various societies established in town for the purpose of teaching the simpleJews and householders Bibles, midrash, the Ethics of the Fathers, and the sermonsof preachers, made a larger impression on the life of the population. Every few yearsone of these societies would experience a period of growth, and then give way toanother society. The richest of these was the Regular Study Group; its Hebrewname, Kovei Atim, was popularly shortened to Kvaytim. The members built a head-quarters near the large study house, the finest building any of the communal institu-tions possessed, where the well-known preacher Reb Shloyme Baruch Mayer b/m,taught. An unusual character, he had been educated in the modern, but strictlyreligious yeshiva in Pressburg, was a follower of the Hsam Sofer, and had alsostudied in a German gymnasium. He was extremely attentive to Jewish law in bothmajor and trivial matters.After his death, the lessons at the Regular Study Group were led by Reb JecheskielZajac, the son of the Rabbi of Olkusz and member of the Kamienica family. Thiscomplicated, multifaceted character, with a partially modern education and muchJewish knowledge, was an important, wealthy lumber merchant with aristocraticurges, and at the same time a man of the people who was drawn to social affairs. Hetaught lessons in the Ethics of the Fathers and in the midrash, and his extraordinaryrhetorical skills attracted a large crowd of listeners. Apparently the Regular StudyGroup was lucky in attracting good teachers, because the last of them, Reb MoysheHochbaum m/b/a, was also an unusual man. Born and raised in the family of ashoemaker from Chrzanow, he was nevertheless a great scholar, and the son-in-lawof the rabbinical judge of Chrzanow, Reb Chayem Volf Richter b/m. He was well-read, popular and possessed remarkable pedagogical talents.THE PSALM SOCIETYAs its name implies, this society was created for the simple Jews—artisans andstorekeepers—so that they could pray and read Psalms together before praying onthe days when there was no market. Also, on the second day of Shevuot (which istraditionally regarded as the day of King David's death), they organized a great cele-bration, marching with large burning candles into the synagogue across the way,where the synagogue cantor and the choir triumphally sang the traditional Psalm ofDavid. At the same time they arranged a festive meal for all of their members.44The Educational Institutions of Chrzanoivhimself, and bitter on account of his poverty. The boys, aged between ten andtwelve, studied for ten hours a day. When they turned thirteen they were sent asapprentices to an artisan—a tailor, shoemaker, or employee in some business. Theyleft the Talmud Torah as ignoramuses, and if they became free thinkers in time, it isbecause they became hostile to Torah Judaism at the Talmud Torah.Most of the income of the Talmud Torah was raised through the second pledge ofeveryone who was called to the Torah on the Sabbath, in any of the synagogues—and even more from all of the pledges during the week of the Torah portion of Yittro.Sometimes, there would also be modest bequests by people who were near death.But despite the popularity of the society that ran the Talmud Torah, and despite thefrequent meetings and appeals in the name of the prominent men of the city, theschool's income was small. The teachers' meager salaries were rarely paid on time,and often not paid for several months at a time. Thus most of the teachers were in-competent ne'er-do-wells, who disseminated the Torah with the whip and the fist.One exception was an extraordinary pedagogue, the well-liked Reb Elye Rosen-boym b/m. (He was generally known as Elye Reb Meir's.) He taught the highestgrade of the Five Books with Rashi's commentary at the Talmud Torah. He wouldalso often read from books of morality. With his great logical powers and his story-telling, parables, and legends, he appealed to his young listeners. He gave them alively description of every chamber in the Gehenna described in the book The Begin-ning of Wisdom. He also described the great envy the nations of the world felt towardthe Congregation of Israel on account of the Torah, which is the crown of all theseven wisdoms bestowed by God. The students regarded Reb Elye Meir withrespect and affection, and he had great influence on them.In the years after Reb Elye Rosenboym's death, a second Bible teacher, YehoshueShlayderer, was also something of an exception. While he didn't have Reb ElyeMeir's power of interpretation, he did have a good heart. He had a careful, almostpaternal attitude toward the children, washing their hands and faces before he sentthem home. He was also acquainted with modem mores, and tried to update thecurriculum a bit.Often this neglected institution managed to find people who gave all of theirenergy on its behalf. For instance, the well-known philanthropists Gitl Nachman's,Yocheved Wiener, and Fanny Cyfer collected clothing and shoes for many years,which were distributed among the Talmud Torah children during the winter.THE BARON HIRSCH SCHOOLThanks to this Foundation, a Baron Hirsch school was established in Chrzanow, asin several other cities in Galicia, at the beginning of the twentieth century. Thisschool, with the help of its substantial funding, was expected to take over Chrzanow.It was set up in finely-appointed rooms in Reb Leybish Yungenvirt's house onKrzyska Street. Experienced teachers were brought in, and the students receivedfree instruction in secular studies, Polish, and German, as well as religion, includingthe Bible with Rashi's commentary. The students were provided with free text-43The Educational Institutionsin ChrzanowCHRZANOW WAS known primarily as a city of trade and artisanry, with its Prussianmerchants, its tailors, and market merchants. Its inhabitants were Chasidim andmen of good deeds. Chrzanow never boasted any world-famous yeshivas; it neverproduced any great men of the Torah famed throughout the world. NeverthelessTorah education occupied an important position. In the early days prior to WorldWar I, the major center of Torah was the large study house. It was always packedwith young men and boys who studied there day and night. Later, after World War I,and especially after 1919, when General Haller's anti-Semitic armies turned thestudy house into a barn for a short period (later it was ruined and demolished), thecenter of Torah was diminished and dispersed to the Chasidic synagogues of theSanzer, Bobower, and Radomsker Chasidim. Only when someone wanted to checka reference in a rare volume did he go to the large abandoned study house, because itswalls were still filled with shelves of rare, precious volumes.The pious Jews who resided in the city did not possess any particular sense ofsocial good, nor did they establish any significant educational institutions. Theeducational societies they did establish, such as Talmud Torah, the Psalm Society,the Regular Study Group and the like, generally flourished for only a short time.These groups died together with their founders, who had devoted so much energyand sacrifice to them while they were still alive. The only exception was the Sup-porters of Study, which existed for three decades without interruption, and whichhad a great influence on the education of Chrzanow's youth.In the following pages we will review each of the major educational institutions.TALMUD TORAHIn every Jewish settlement, a communal Jewish school was established, and itshould have been the greatest of the educational institutions. However, the TalmudTorah, which existed for over 150 years in Chrzanow, flourished only rarely. All of itsstudents were poor, or more accurately, the poorest of the poor, including a largenumber of orphans. The level of study was quite low. Thousands—tens of thou-sands—passed through its classroom doors, and we can say without any exaggera-tion that the Talmud Torah did not produce a single rabbinical scholar. For the mostpart its students were ill-clothed, hungry boys who studied in poorly maintainedrooms, with up to eighty in a class, taught by a teacher who was dreadfully poor42Prominent Folks of the CityMunich went straight to our bones. In 1946 he was summoned to America to directthe organizational department of the World Jewish Congress.It is indeed difficult to characterize Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart. Should we beginwith the organizational activist or the journalist? The Zionist leader, the politician, orthe representative of the people's wishes? His multifaceted character demands moreextensive treatment, and a thorough picture of this great personality cannot be pro-vided in the narrow framework of this volume.At the time this book is being written, in the late 1940s, it is too early to evaluate hisactivities. Despite his sixty years and hard work. Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart is still inthe midst of his work on behalf of his land and his people, toiling with faith andcourage. We hope and wish to see Dr. Schwartzbart as a leading personality in theState of Israel for which we have longed and dreamed, speedily and in our days.41ChrzanbwShe participated in all of the philanthropic institutions in the city, without neglectingher home and children. Together with her husband, she worked in the business, andshe did not forget about paupers, the elderly, and the sick of the city.If Polish and world Jewry owes something to Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart, then weshould say, as our parents used to, "Happy is the woman who bore him!" ChaneSchwartzbart honestly earned the right to be mentioned together with her great son.Moving and just is the inscription on her grave at the Chrzanow cemetery: "Sheraised her children to be faithful to their people."Ignac and Itzchak Schwartzbart aren't quite the same person, however. Ignac, thegymnasium student, looked for a semblance of truth in socialism. Later, however,Itzchak discovered a purely Jewish truth when he went to the univeristy and en-countered the Jewish national renaissance movement represented by Herzl'sJudenstatt and by Yiddish and Hebrew culture. As soon as he convinced himself ofthis Jewish truth, twenty-year-old Itzchak threw himself into the work heart andsoul.Dr. Itzchak Schwartzbart was born on November 13,1888 in Chrzanow. In 1911, atage 23, Schwartzbart was already playing a leading role in nationalist circles, beingelected chairman of the Zionist academic organization Hashachar in Cracow. Thisgroup later became the avant-garde of the Zionist leadership in Western Galicia andSilesia. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 sent Schwartzbart to the countryside ofcentral Poland as a judge in the Austrian military courts.At the end of the war, he was entrusted with the general secretariat of the newly-formed Zionist executive of Western Galicia and Silesia. At the same time Dr.Schwartzbart participated in the founding and direction of the Jewish national coun-cil in Cracow, under the leadership of his great teacher and future adversary. Dr.Yehoshua Tohn him.In 1921 Dr. Schwartzbart was named editor-in-chief of the Cracow daily NowyDziennik. A Polish-language newspaper, it was nevertheless a proudly Jewishnational tribune, and the Jewish and even Polish public gave its opinions seriousconsideration. At the same time he was a collaborator on the Lemberg Chwila, theWarsaw Moment, and countless other periodicals. By the late 1940s, Dr. Schwartz-bart had been a delegate to virtually every Zionist congress for almost forty years; in1933 he was elected a member of the Zionist action committee. A short time later healso became a member of the administrative council of the World Jewish Congress.As a candidate for Dr. Tohn's position in the Polish Sejm, Schwartzbart received94% of the Jewish votes. He was also a member of the Cracow city council, and chair-man of the Jewish councilmembers' club.When Hitler's war broke out. Dr. Schwartzbart managed to escape to Rumania,where he became involved in intensive social action among the Jewish refugees. Allof his energy was devoted to getting Jews to the Land of Israel. In 1940, GeneralSikorsky summoned him to join the Polish government in London. At the end ofHitler's war Dr. Schwartzbart was the first Polish Jew to return and visit the surviv-ing remnant in Germany. His speech at the first congress of the Jewish survivors in40Prominent Folks of the Cityby rare individuals. He was the only Talmudic scholar in Chrzanow to publish abook that would have a major impact elsewhere.Reb Moyshe also completed a second volume in his last years—a sort of anthologyof Torah insights and commentaries on difficult passages of the Talmud. Unfor-tunately the manuscript was destroyed by Nazi murderers. Among the Talmudscholars of Chrzanow, Reb Moyshe occupied the most prominent place, despite hismodesty and humility, despite the fact that he fled public honors. His extraordinarysimplicity served as an example for those around him, who appreciated his finecharacter. He lived among Chasidim, and yet he was no Chasid; he didn't thinkmuch of the rebes with their “courts/' unless they were sources of pure, genuineTorah.Reb Moyshe suffered the full cruelty of the destruction of his city. In May 1942, atage 79, he was sent to Auschwitz during the first deportation. He was accompanied byhis youngest daughter Taybl, who would not abandon her father to the murderers,even though she could have escaped. His pure and honest soul left his body, alongwith the souls of many other Chrzanow Jews, there in Auschwitz.May vengeance befall his murderers! (Will they ever be avenged?)DR. ITZCHAK SCHWARTZBART (see Introduction)And last but not least, the best and the brightest gift of the city of Chrzanow toworld Jewry in general and to Polish Jewry in particular. The son of the city who isthe pride of Chrzanow Jewry, and who miraculously survived, from among the largecircle of Jewish personalities which Polish Jewry once boasted.If a few Jews get together and start talking about Dr. Schwartzbart, you will im-mediately discover which, if any, of these Jews comes from Chrzanow. The Jewfrom Chrzanow won't refer to him as Itzchak, but rather as Ignac, since that is how weknew him from his earliest childhood on. Forty-odd (circa 1905) years ago he used tocome home to his parents for the Jewish holidays wearing the uniform of anAustrian gymnasium student, with gold stripes on his collar. We who were stillsmall boys, although strictly Chasidic, drew strength and pleasure from every newstripe, which indicated that he had passed into a higher grade. Eventually, he wentto the university to become a doctor. Somehow we children of that generation in-stinctively sensed that Ignac would make something out of himself. We just didn'tknow that he would go so far, that he would be known throughout the world.His father, Reb Mordechai Shoyel, was a simple, honest Jew, who maintained aproper, religious Jewish house. He maintained a tavern (first across from the Ka-mienica, and then on the marketplace, where Bochenek most recently ran the inn),where he earned his living by honest toil. Reb Shoyel was strict, but upright. Hecould pronounce the truth straightforwardly, without flattery or ulterior motives.Ignac's mother was a precious Jewish woman, a “kosher soul" as they used tosay, with a native nobility. Like every pious Jewish woman, she wore a wig. Never-theless, she had a sense of modern education and modern methods of child-rearing.39Chrzanowcity. He was sensitive and energetic, and despite his 56 years—he was born about1888-90—he had an activist's youthful temperament. He was tied body and soul toChrzanow, both as a founder of Poalei Zion in 1905, forty years before this writing,and also by seeing to the needs of the surviving Jews from Chrzanow in Americaafter Hitler's war.Mordechai Shor was one of the most interesting of the characters who stood at thecradle of the Zionist movement in Chrzanow early in this century. He stood out bothfor his seriousness as a leader, and for his eternal good humor, which earned him theaffection of all the young people. He was very popular everywhere, and was referredto as "Comrade Shor," a title he earned honestly by his friendly and compassionateattitude not only toward his own comrades, but also to the opposition camp. Evendyed-in-the-wool pietists treated him with more sympathy than any of the otherparty leaders in the city.And as it turned out Mordechai Shor remained the same always; only the circum-stances changed around him. He remained the same "Comrade Shor," and perhapsbecame even more so. Right after the war, when the news spread about the greatdestruction of Polish Jewry in general and of the Jews of Chrzanow in particular,Mordechai Shor was the first to spring into action. He was the only Jew fromChrzanow outside Europe who responded to the great disaster. With self-sacrificeand abundant energy, he organized assistance for the Jews of Chrzanow, although itwas bitterly difficult for him to assemble petty sums from the poor Jews fromChrzanow (rich people do not give easily). When the money was finally counted,however, it came to several thousand dollars. He himself bought goods, packedthem, and sent them to the surviving Jews of Chrzanow wherever they were living.And for this the Jews of Chrzanow will eternally remember him.May these few modest lines serve as an acknowledgment of his altruistic efforts,and comfort for all of the bitterness and anguish he doubtless experienced. And maythe Lord give him his reward.REB MOYSHE BOCHNER-MAY THE LORD AVENGE HIS BLOOD(Moyshe Avrom HeshTs)Just like his grandfather, the first rabbi of Chrzanow, Reb Moyshe Bochner wasalso a modest man who kept his light under a bushel. He didn't seek fame, butstayed within his own four walls. Even among the Jews of Chrzanow he was not par-ticularly popular, because the public did not know him well. They were unaware ofhis sharp insight and his thorough knowledge of the sea of the Talmud and of therabbinical literature. He was valued at his proper worth only by the scholarly circlesin Chrzanow, and to some degree in Cracow as well, since he lived there for severalyears.He only revealed himself to the public, and to the scholarly world in particular, in1926 when, already 60 years old, he published his Book of the Thoughts of Moses. Itscontents display unusual breadth of knowledge and insight, of a kind attained only38Prominent Folks of the Cityscale, with a deep understanding of others' needs. The story is told of how he wasonce visited by a pauper whom he did not know. Seeing that the Jew was welldressed, he gave the man a gold piece, assuming that he had once been well-off buthad lost his money. That night, however, a member of his household reported see-ing the same pauper at a restaurant, spending the entire gold piece on goose andwine. Hearing this, Reb Cyna left his house, found the poor Jew, and gave himanother gold piece, saying that if he had known the Jew was accustomed to eatinggoose and drinking wine, he would have given him two gold pieces in the first place,instead of just one. This episode is generally characteristic of the wealthy Jews offormer times, who distributed charity not for the sake of their own reputations, butbecause of their desire to help the needy.Reb Cyna Kurz was always cheerful when it came to giving money. He and hispartner Reb Shloyme Zelinger held the monopoly on the sale of spirits under theAustrian government. He was a loyal devotee of Reb Naftoli, and since he wanted tosupport the latter somehow, Reb Cyna invented various disputes with his partner,whose handling of financial matters left something to be desired. Reb Naftoli earneda fine living from these frequent court cases.Although he was wealthy, Reb Kurz lived modestly; although not a scholarhimself, he supported rabbinical scholars and Torah institutions; although he wasnot a Chasid, any rebe who came to town found a warm welcome at his home. Thatwas the kind of Jew the master of the courtyard was. And now a few words about thecourtyard itself.If Chrzanow was a true Jewish city, Reb Cyna Kurz's courtyard was the mostJewish spot in town. In addition to Reb Cyna and his children, other Jewish familieslived there, and together they comprised one large Jewish family.A purely Jewish life pulsed in that courtyard. A clock and a Jewish calendar weresuperfluous there—all of the neighbors arose to say penitential prayers at the sametime; everyone lit Sabbath candles simultaneously. Even if someone had forgottenthat it was the Sabbath, the redolence of fish and cooking cholent would havereminded him. And it was the same at every Jewish holiday.A contemporary description of this courtyard was printed in the YlVO-Bleter,published in Vilna, as an example of genuine Jewish culture. There were otherJewish courtyards in town, but Gentiles sometimes made their way into those. AtReb Cyna Kurz's courtyard, on the other hand, the air was purely Jewish.For various political purposes, such as elections, the parties would send represen-tatives specifically to concentrate on this courtyard. In the earlier years all that wasneeded was Reb Cyna's approval, and the entire courtyard would vote along withhim. Reb Cyna's word was law.MORDECHAI SHORReb Mordechai Shor, who was well known to the people of Chrzanow both in thepast and today, must not be omitted from our pantheon of the prominent folk of the37Chrzanowwonderful parables. Since he was himself an experienced merchant with a solidknowledge of the practical world, his influence over his audience was significantlygreater than that of the professional preachers and the speakers who had no otheroccupation.Because of his fine personal character and his friendly attitude toward his fellows,he was loved and respected by a large number of Jews in Chrzanow. May hismemory be blessed.REB SHMUEL GRAJOWER OF BLESSED MEMORYReb Shmuel Grajower was neither a community activist nor a simple busybody.He was neither a 'big shot" nor even a representative of the community in its deal-ings with the authorities, although his intellectual capacities and his material meanswere such that he could have held a prominent position in society. Nevertheless,Reb Shmuel Grajower was one of the brightest lights among the leading per-sonalities of our city.He was a descendant of the rabbinical judge of Cracow, Reb Yidl Grajower b/m,and also of the well-known Cracow family Shamrot, who were famous for theirquick and "wild" minds. Reb Shmuel was among the "last of the Mohicans," arepresentative of the old-style Galician Jewish Enlighteners, and a leading student ofthe founders of Wissenschaft des Judentums (Jewish secular knowledge), Reb S. Y. Rap-poport, Reb Nachman Krochmal, and Reb Josef Perl.Among the large number of rabbinical scholars in Chrzanow, Reb Shmuel stoodout with his thorough, encyclopedic knowledge, his phenomenal memory, and hislogical analysis. He was a man of deep erudition both in Talmudic and secularknowledge, and he had a modern, relevant approach to all of the problems ofJudaism in general, and to Jewish research in particular. Reb Shmuel represented afine Jewish synthesis of deep religiosity and modern humanist thinking.In addition, Reb Shmuel, along with his brothers Reb Chayeml Grajower fromKwocala and Reb Sender Grajower from Jaworzno, were known throughoutWestern Galicia for having the most thorough knowledge of the Book of Books—theFive Books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Writings.As a good Hebrew stylist and grammarian, he devoted a great deal of study to theolder Jewish literature. Catholic clergy visited him frequently, in order to hear hisopinions regarding various philosophical or religious questions, although theymanaged somehow to avoid unpleasant religious disputes.The nobler individuals among the Polish intelligentsia also treated him with greatrespect, which was a source of great honor for Jewish Chrzanow.REB CYNA KURZ OF BLESSED MEMORY AND HIS COURTYARDReb Cyna Kurz was a sort of Jewish patrician, quite a wealthy man, and the verymodel of the old-fashioned Jewish patriarch. He was a philanthropist on a generous36Prominent Folks of the CityCyfer's talent, potential, stubbornness, and Jewish pride became obvious. He washeld back neither by the petrified attitudes of the Chasidic masses, nor by the'' Whatwill the Gentiles say?" crowd, the distorted ideologues among the small group ofassimilators.During the elections to the Austrian parliament, the rabbis and rebes, who did nothave an activist conception of politics, controlled the masses and always orderedthem to vote for the candidates put forward by the government, even if they werethe worst anti-Semites, to keep the aristocracy satisfied. But Dr. Cyfer fought like alion in defense of Jewish national principles and political aspirations.In matters that had to do with defending Jewish interests, Shmuel Cyfer was acompetent lawyer of deep erudition. At the same time, however, he was anoutspoken fighter against discrimination. He thoroughly opposed the accommoda-tionist politics of many of the leaders of Chrzanow, and he struggled against themdespite their temporary successes. Jewish national honor was more important tohim than all of the little favors and kindnesses which the well-known Jewishrepresentatives Reb Faytl Halman and Reb Zisma Kinreich won from the Polishauthorities by dishonorable means.When the Germans arrived Dr. Shmuel Cyfer fled deeper into the country with hissister, believing that he would be able to escape them someplace where he was notknown. He and his sister both died at the hands of German murderers during theslaughter in 1942 m/b/a.REB JECHESKIEL ZAJAC OF BLESSED MEMORYThe older generation has tragically disappeared, and in the future we will neveragain have the opportunity to meet such fine and interesting Jewish characters asReb Jecheskiel Zajac. Therefore it is worthwhile to include a brief and modest pictureof this rich personality amongst our gallery of the city's prominent people.A son of the Rabbi of Olkusz, in his youth he had absorbed Torah for its own sake,without neglecting books of Jewish morality as well as secular books. Nevertheless,he didn't lose his soul, as the expression went in those days. On the contrary: it waswhile reading foreign literature that he first became a devoted patriot of higherJewish morals. The education of the younger generation became his main mission.Reb Jecheskiel Zajac believed that neither the slaps of the fathers nor the whips of theteachers were proper means of education, but rather kind speech and impassionedappeal to the conscience of the child. Some extremely moving scenes took placewhen Reb Jecheskiel addressed the children in the study house or the Talmud Torah.His native talent as a spiritual guide greatly influenced their religious and intellectuallife.Reb Jecheskiel Zajac also devoted a good deal of time and energy to elderly Jewishartisans and storekeepers, giving them lectures in the Jewish morality books and theTorah portion of the week on the Sabbath and holidays. He also stood out as apreacher, drawing large audiences with his power of logical persuasion and his35ChrzanowDR. ADOLF RIESERWe, the older Zionists, always called him "The Old Man." This nickname ex-pressed both our affection and our deep respect for the well-known doctor.We liked him for his warm human and Jewish heart, for his pure conscience andhis affectionate attitudes. As a doctor, he earned the affection of every Jew inChrzanow without exception. But we also respected him as an honest and uncondi-tional Zionist of Herzl's school.In his youth he and Dr. Shmuel Cyfer had led the Zionist movement in Chrzanow.He had taken an active part in every Zionist undertaking, and gave a great deal of hisincome to Zionist funds. His money paid for the erection of the Anshey-Chayelsynagogue, which served as the assembly hall for Zionist demonstrations. Under hisinfluence, his wife worked tirelessly on behalf of the Jewish nation. Her commit-ment and behavior served as a model for our Jewish women.When the Jewish intelligentsia became better developed, Dr. Adolf Rieser set thetone for the Jewish nationalist camp in general, and for the nationalist intelligentsiain particular.All of the surviving Jews of Chrzanow will be happy to learn that our "Old Man"miraculously avoided the murderous hands of the Nazis, and survived to see therealization of his lifelong dream: the proclamation of the Jewish state in the Land ofIsrael.(The touch of his hand, his smile, his mere presence was enough to make one feelwell again. S.G.)DR. SHMUEL CYFERThe son of Leybl and Fanny Cyfer, Shmuel Cyfer was bom into a modern,enlightened Jewish family. A lawyer by profession, for a long time he was the direc-tor of the Jewish birth registry, and the First Vice Mayor of Chrzanow.Samuel Cyfer, as he was generally known in the city, well earned the right to amonument among its prominent folk. A warm-hearted Jew and a Zionist with abroad perspective, he had a fine instinct for the common good. He could haveachieved high status in the larger Jewish world. However, his patriotic feeling forChrzanow and his concern for the needs of the Jewish population kept him rooted toour city. Of equal importance was his true and pure love for his extended family, towhich he sacrificed his own family happiness.In order to evaluate his forty years of activity, we must first acquaint ourselveswith the atmosphere in which Dr. Shmuel Cyfer lived. On one hand there was aChasidic, conservative mass that wouldn't permit even the slightest fresh breeze toblow in from the outside world; on the other hand there was a young generationgrowing up, which threw itself from one extreme to the other. In addition there wasa small Jewish intelligentsia, made up of people who prided themselves on theirPolish culture, but were unable to find a proper place in the world.As soon as his social activity on behalf of Jewish nationalism began, Shmuel34Prominent Folks of the Cityparison may be permitted, the Wagner of thoughtful composition in his cantorialcreations. He was a master of choral music, a wonderful conductor, and above all alyric tenor with a voice that was a gift from God. In the earlier years he would singthe blessings over the lighting of the Chanukah candles to the accompaniment of anexpanded choir and a finely balanced string and brass orchestra. This was always agreat event, attracting crowds of music lovers. Among his listeners and fans was theabove-mentioned Reb Hirsh Leyb.Several of those who trained and sang with his choir later became well-known can-tors. Among them were the head cantor of the Pazmonit Temple in Vienna, YosefGiblikhman, and the future first Heldentenor of the Royal Opera in Berlin, YosefMan.Thanks to these two famous cantors, Reb Hirsh Leyb and Reb Leybish Mayzeles,the Jews of Chrzanow had some notion of good music in general, and of Jewishmusic in particular. Chrzanow had an entire pleiad of singers who were widelyknown for their extraordinary talent, such as Igor Goren of the Metropolitan Opera,despite the fact that they did not know how to read music. In Chrzanow, the onewho led the prayer in congregation was not only responsible for appealing to theMost High, but also had to be a fit musician.REB YISROEL LEYZER WEINTRAUB OF BLESSED MEMORYThe "Bathan from Chrzanow,” the wedding performer Weintraub was famousnot only in Poland, but beyond Poland's borders as well. He was much in demand atthe weddings of wealthy and rabbinical families.More than simply a facile inventor of rhymes, like the majority of wedding jesters,he was a typical Chrzanow bathan and a serious rabbinical scholar. In addition tohis first-class skill at recitation, his rhymes were peppered with profound textual in-sight and pearls of wisdom from the ancient rabbis. His jokes and puns were packedwith cheerful good humor.Weintraub was a bona fide genius at this craft, a first-class performer. When hewas reciting in front of the groom before the ceremony, or in front of the bride duringthe ritual of checking her veil, even elderly Jews wept rivers of tears—and then theydoubled over in laughter after the wedding supper, when Weintraub entertained thecrowd with his jokes and "bits.”As a rule, whenever anyone was invited to a wedding, the first question waswhether Weintraub would be present. Everyone knew that the catering had to be alittle fancier at a wedding where Yisroel Leyzer Weintraub was going to perform.His jokes and impersonations often lifted Jewish Chrzanow out of deep sadness.When people were depressed it was enough for Weintraub to appear, and theybegan to laugh and forget their troubles. Such was the power of this modern HersheleOstropoler (famous Galician humorist).33Chrzanoww—rt3d=tdT"ep—r—»—-nr-fWT7*-.i. -f—hj 1 ’ b=fa=dHi—-—■Mlmmm■Sh| V iBBrW JBBJMHP’ JHH .WHS■ igmJimb BB■PMK jhi^hMB' JHP^ISbbbhHmLBJM§^■1 bbBl HMHI^iBl IBB CJB BHHH fJB BBb^bhum■mnBiBBHBIHrlHHPVHiiMB MBVBiMMi. . # -=Fi-trP:-— 1  t 1 br~k—t—k  L K k—i r1 ^ K l k t  i■ .■■niMHBBB■BJBBB MBB^TMB flBMB BBTHIHif ■- w jiw .aB BHBBM iBB «'Bi MBBBBBMflBB■ r^Mi'JHBHBHBB M■VMBMJB HI1 BB BJB '.ilMI BBB HiP® BMBBR B^BBI BW* BBIH ||BBW 4HK HBK .JBMiBHli-sqc — ■=~BS-   ^  1i« JsoREB LEYBISH MAYZELES OF BLESSED MEMORY(The Synagogue Cantor)Equal glory attached to Chrzanow thanks to the efforts of the cantor of the townsynagogue, Reb Leybish Mayzeles b/m. Those Jews of Chrzanow who knew himwell will agree that he belongs among this gallery of the prominent people in our city.Reb Leybish thoroughly and properly earned this distinction not only through hisforty years of activity as a cantorial musician, but also through his fine character as aJew and as a man. A member of nature's aristocracy, he had been well brought upand also had an advanced musical education. He was a scholar and an honestlypious, observant Jew, an enthusiastic Chasid, and close to the courts of both Sadiguraand Husyatin. These virtures earned Reb Leybish considerable honor and recogni-tion from the Jews of Chrzanow.If Reb Hirsh Leyb was the Verdi of Chasidic music, Reb Leybish was, if the com-32Prominent Folks of the Cityreached hearts and minds. The following episode illustrates how powerfully histalent influenced his audience.While the writer of these lines was riding the train from Breslau to Berlin one daymany years ago, he was approached by a German, who introduced himself as a Jew.One Rosh Hashanah, he said, when he was in Chrzanow, he wanted to hear thefamous cantor. When he entered the large study house, he was simply terrified bythe gesticulations and rocking back and forth of the Chasidic congregants, and bythe inhuman sounds they made as they prayed. But when he heard Reb Hirsh Leyb"saying" the cantor's prayer "Here am I (Hineni)," he was overcome by a mon-umental urge to repent, and he decided that from that day on he would live only forJews, and if necessary sacrifice his life for Judaism.A few of Reb Hirsh Leyb's students are still living as this book is being written.They remember his wonderful compositions, and it would be more than worthwhilefor them to collect these treasures of Jewish music and record them. In doing so,they would earn the thanks of future generations, and be blessed for the merit of thisgood deed.[Publisher's note: His son Itzchak, who is a professor of literature at Ben GurionUniversity, is working on this task, and I am certain that he will accomplish it ad-mirably.]H.L. BAKON'S KOL NIDRE PRAYER"Ke-Hine-Kachomer" (As Clay Are We)31Chrzanowfamilies, artisans, who suffered hunger along with their families, unwilling to letothers know about their need. Reb Zismele saw to it that these needy people hadfood.As a child the writer of these lines often saw Reb Zismele secretly approachingsuch respectable people while they stood reciting the Eighteen Benedictions, slippingseveral guldens into their pockets. Often the recipients themselves didn't know whotheir benefactor was, who had perhaps rescued them from hunger. Commendably,the city knew how to honor this Jew, and was well aware of his modesty and piety.REB HIRSH LEYB BAKON OF BLESSED MEMORY(The Study House Cantor)Although Reb Hirsh Leyb was not born in Chrzanow, he made Jewish Chrzanowfamous throughout the world, and the fact that Chrzanow became in time a center ofJewish and Chasidic music is largely attributed to him.He was simultaneously a scholar, a musical genius, a wonderful Heldentenor, anda prolific composer. His compositions are said to number in the hundreds; they werecarried across the world, and often people didn't even know who composed them.Reb Hirsh Leyb composed settings for all of the Jewish prayers, including the bless-ing of the sun (which is said only once every 28 years) and final confessions. In fact,many composers and musicians have expressed the opinion that his setting of theconfession surpasses the power of Chopin's Funeral March. His melodies and hisspecifically Chasidic style of prayer exemplified both Jewish sincerity and cantorialcraft.Reb Hirsh Leyb founded a school in Chrzanow, conducting services according tohis original style. No new or foreign elements were introduced—rather, like askillful art collector, he conserved various forms, and as an expert in his craft hesorted out all the versions that had been passed down from generation to genera-tion. Out of them he created a single harmonious, complete melody, which echoed,precious and intimate, in the ear of the Jewish modern musicians, including non-Jews.Reb Hirsh Leyb prayed in the large study house, which was filled to overflowingevery time he performed.Reb Hirsh Leyb was closely connected to Chrzanow, and had no desire to ex-change his Chrzanow audience for any other. When he was temporarily in Berlin,from 1919 until 1924, representatives of the local orthodox synagogue on GrenadierStrasse tried hard to hire him, offering much more favorable terms than he had inChrzanow. He was also offered a cantorial post in London, but Reb Hirsh Leybrefused. As he quite accurately put it, he only wanted to lead prayers for Jews whoprayed along with him, and who understood what he was saying or singing.And he was even understood by people who could not translate the Hebrewwords of the prayers. In addition to his cantorial compositions, he was a master ofthe art of cantorial "saying," (Zugen), interpreting the prayers in such a way that he30Prominent Folks of the Citya blessing or a promise from this genuine holy man.The spiritual influence of the Zheliner Rebe on the Jews of Chrzanow was notespecially great, however, because Jews in Chrzanow tended to be attracted toChasidic courts that were also centers of Torah, such as Sanz, Shinew, Radomsk, andlater Bobow. Nevertheless, his moral influence was noticeable among the Jewishpopulation because of his extraordinary love of charity. The Zheliner Rebe set an ex-ample of how charity is to be distributed, immediately distributing to the poor all themoney he received from his numerous wealthy followers. He didn't even keepenough for his own needs—it was said that the Rebe's wife often had to approachhis secretary for a loan. Especially impressive was his concern that poor but respect-able families be provided with the necessities for Passover. The Rebe had matzohsbaked at his own expense, bought potatoes, and had good wines for the four cupsbrought from Hungary and from the Land of Israel. He had these distributed by peo-ple he trusted to the homes of the needy, sparing the latter unnecessary embarrass-ment.When the Koshenitser Rebe returned from a visit to the doctors in Vienna in 1910,broken and sick, he stopped to visit the Zheliner Rebe in Chrzanow. He died at thelatter's home. Before he died he wrote to his family: "I'm staying at the home of aJew, who can intercede with Heaven on behalf of a Rebe.REB ZISMELE SHAMES OF BLESSED MEMORY(Caretaker)Reb Zismele Shames was an interesting Jewish character—a paradox even in theearly years—and it is worth acquainting ourselves with this truly honest man whoonce lived in Chrzanow.Reb Zismele Shames (Cyzner) had a fine textile store in the middle of the market-place, and didn't lack income. He traded in feathers, did business with the greatCracow firms, and was respected by other merchants. Moreover, he was also a scholarwhose opinion was to be reckoned with; he had a phenomenal memory, and knewthe entire Mishnah by heart. He was the very model of a philanthropist, and never-theless—for five decades, he was the simple caretaker of the great synagogue. Howdid this happen? Quite simply. For some time the great synagogue had no caretaker.Since there was no one to light the candles and take care of other everyday chores,Reb Zismele volunteered to serve as caretaker without remuneration, thusdemonstrating that it was no shame, but rather an honor, to serve God's home.From that point on he neglected his business, and devoted himself entirely to hisresponsibilities at the synagogue.Private citizens provided some income, and later the community also began to payhim a salary, but he devoted this money to charity in the very highest form im-aginable. His distribution of charity was according to a plan. It didn't consist of giv-ing pennies to poor people who extend their hands for alms, for whom taking charityis a profession. Rather, Reb Zismele made it his specialty to seek out worthy heads of29Chrzanbwtask fully. She displayed extraordinary energy and courage during efforts to rescueJewish souls from the hands of proselytizing Gentiles. In Bobrek, about tenkilometers from Chrzanow, there lived a countess who considered it her duty tomaintain a dormitory for deserted children in a nearby convent. Every time GitlNachman's found out from the employees of the convent that a Jewish child had madeits way there, she would run to the countess and apply every possible means of per-suasion to convince her to surrender the Jewish child. This required energy and self-sacrifice, because the anti-Semitic countess would set her dogs on Gitl and make theservants tease her, knowing that if Gitl managed to get in, she would have to accedeto her every request.The old age home in Chrzanow was built thanks to her initiative and even more,thanks to her money. She put a huge amount of work into that institution, which un-fortunately became neglected and declined after her departure.Even mental defectives in town benefited from her attentive eye and noble heart.The well-known town madman Menachem Moyshe, who always neglected his ap-pearance and hygiene, was occasionally seized by men whom Gitl paid to force himto the bathhouse, where he was washed and given clean clothes. Many stories weretold about her influence on open and secret sinners whom she brought back to decent,Jewish society. One of these stories relates that the mayor of Chrzanow at the time,the committed assimilationist and Jewish anti-Semite Dr. Kepler, who literally couldnot look a fellow Jew in the eye, was so moved by Gitl's personality and nobility thathe promised for her sake to wear fringes and to put on tefilin every day.Gitl Nachman's longed all her life to travel to the land of our ancestors. Still middle-aged and childless when her husband died, she moved to the longed-for land, andcontinued her work on behalf of Jewish Chrzanow through her prayers and suppli-cations at the Western Wall and Rachel's grave.REB AVROM YOYSEF IGRA OF BLESSED MEMORY(The Zheliner Rebe)The Zheliner Rebe lived and played a significant role in Chrzanow for many years.This Jew was remarkable neither for his scholarship nor for his sharp mind, noreven for his' 'court.'' If he is reckoned here among the prominent folk of the city, it isprimarily because his piety was famed not only in the city itself, but also beyond itsborders.A small, thin Jew, he did not stand out in a crowd. On the other hand, he was ab-solute and strict. He had an immense influence on his Chasidim, who were recruitedfor the most part from among the Jewish masses, and in particular, from among theGerman Jews who lived on the other side of the border.His conduct was different from that of the other rebes of his time. He was anascetic in the full sense of the word, spending entire days in prayer and fasting, totallyremoved from the vain things of this world. Bitter hearts streamed to him from farand wide seeking relief, and they went away feeling more cheerful, having received28Prominent Folks of the CityREB BERISH LEVY OF BLESSED MEMORYThis man has truly earned himself a place on the honor roll of the leading men ofChrzanow.He was quite wealthy, and was respected by the government officials of the area.Although Reb Berish Levy was uneducated (he literally could not read or write anylanguage other than Yiddish), he was the mayor of Chrzanow for a long time. Sincehe had no children, he spent his entire fortune on charity. His major responsibilitywas to see to the marriage of poor girls and orphans, many of whom he took into hisown home and then married off in opulent style. It was estimated, based on thenumber of fur hats he bought for young bridegrooms, that he had provided for themarriage of fifty such orphan girls in his lifetime.There were also occasions on which Jews who had promised a certain dowrybefore the wedding were unable to come up with the specified sum. The only thingto do in such a case was to go to Reb Berish Levy. He was often awakened in the mid-dle of the night, at which time he would provide the needed funds.He was quite profligate in regard to charity. It has been told that one Purim only afew poor people were asking for money. He got up in the synagogue and announcedthat the people should come without fail to pick up the money which he haddesignated for the holiday. He actually begged them not to ruin his holiday.In addition to the mitzvahs of charity and arranging for the weddings of poor girls,he was also very much involved in visiting the sick. Reb Berish stayed up entirenights with the sick people in town, bringing the finest and most costly of goods forthe poor people among them.Even though he wasn't a Talmud scholar, Reb Berish Levy was deeply beloved bythe Jews of Chrzanow while he was still alive, and he assured himself of a goodname in town after he passed away.GITL NACHMAN'SWhen as a boy I read the various wonderful legends about the pious women of thegenerations, and especially about the glorious figure of Sara bas Tuvim, I was leftwith the impression that the latter must have looked exactly like Gitl Nachman's.In Chrzanow Gitl Nachman's embodied the qualities traditionally expected of aJewish woman: fear of God, love of her fellows, and charity.She was the daughter of a simple, honest Jew, Reb Nachman Vishnitser b/m. Hewas neither a scholar nor a Chasid; on the other hand, he was a charitable man witha warm Jewish heart. His daughter Gitl placed herself in the service of the poor andoppressed, the elderly and the sick, widows and orphans.There wasn't a single charitable society or philanthropic institution in which GitlNachman's did not participate. This noble and sympathetic woman also possessed aniron determination to carry out her own plans, thanks to which she became a legendin her own lifetime.She rightfully considered herself the mother of the town, and she carried out the27ChrzanowReb Yukele's family, or "the people of Kamienica," as they were generally called,were almost all wealthy, learned Chasidim, and community activists. Their majorbusiness was in forests and lumber. The Kamienica family became the noblemen ofthe city. In the early years, they had a great deal of influence at communalassemblies, rabbinical elections, and in virtually all aspects of municipal affairs.Their opinions carried weight, and their behavior in both social and charitable affairswas an example to everyone.The Kamienica family was also the fortress of Sanzer Chasidism. For them, Torahwas the essence of life and, thanks to the traditions they inherited from their grand-fathers, Rabbi Shloymele and Reb Yosl, they brought a great deal of honor to JewishChrzanow.REB SHLOYME LEYBISH OF BLESSED MEMORYIt is well known that the brilliant scholar and rabbi of Sanz, Reb Chaim Halber-shtam b/m, never pronounced the names of cities, fearing that a city might be namedafter a Christian saint, and in pronouncing the name he would bear forbidden wordson his tongue. When he wanted to refer to Chrzanow, he would say, "The citywhere Reb Shloyme Leybish Shenberg lives." That was enough to identifyChrzanow.Reb Shloyme Leybish was well known. A grandson of the previously mentionedReb Yukele Shenberg, he had inherited the leadership of the Kamienica family fromhis grandfather. The fact that the Kamienicas kept within the framework set for themby their founder was largely thanks to its most respected and important repre-sentative, Reb Shloyme Leybish.This man was a magnificent example of the old Jewish patriarchal type, a scholar inthe broad sense of the word, with the finest and most elevated qualities which theterm "scholar" suggests. He dealt in lumber on a large scale; his capabilities werewell-known, and thousands of guldens rode on his expertise. He studied the Tal-mud all his life. Simultaneously blessed with prestige, Torah, and wealth, he re-mained a modest man. It was hard for anyone to beat him to the punch with a"Good morning" or "Good Shabes." He always hurried to greet his fellow man;anyone could approach him; he wasn't full of himself. These qualities earned himthe respect of every Jew in Chrzanow, without exception.While still a young man, Reb Shloyme Leybish had enjoyed a prominent placeamong the intimate circle of the Sanzer Rabbi, and he embodied the true spirit ofSanzer Chasidism, the fine qualities of Reb Chaim b/m. Scholars valued his scholar-ship, simple Jews valued his morals and his simplicity, and the masses valued hismodesty.And thus for seven decades, the name of Reb Shloyme Leybish was synonymouswith "the finest Jew" in the city, and honest, pious women wished each otherchildren who would take after Reb Shloyme Leybish.26Prominent Folks of the CityREB YOSL LIBIANZERREB YOSL LIBIANZER played a significant role—indeed, perhaps the most signifi-cant—in the history of Chrzanow Jews, both in the economic and spiritual realms.Although he himself was not a scholar, he supported other scholars. Reb Yosldonated a great deal of money to various philanthropic institutions in the city whilehe himself still lived in Libianz, about six kilometers from Chrzanow. He was a sortof Jewish leader there; his house was a headquarters for the council of elders. Aninteresting story relates how Reb Yosl became acquainted with the first rabbi ofChrzanow, Reb Shloymele.Reb Shloymele was often visited by his comrade and student Reb Berish Ospit-ziner b/m. Unwilling to part from his friend, Reb Shloymele accompanied him a cer-tain distance on the return trip on foot. They continued discussing affairs of theTorah, until the two men arrived at Auschwitz. And when Reb Shloymele set out toreturn to Chrzanow, Reb Berish refused to let him go alone. Engrossed in weightymatters of the Torah, the two men came back to Chrzanow. This walking back andforth continued, the two rabbis becoming more and more exhausted, until Reb Yoslnoticed what was happening. He waited on the road for them at Libianz, got theminto his coach and took both of them to their homes.From that time a close friendship had arisen between the Rabbi of Chrzanow andReb Yosl Libianzer. Later on the rabbi betrothed his daughter to Reb Yosl's son RebYukele. This marriage was the origin of the Kamienica family, which played a signifi-cant role in the development of the lumber industry in Chrzanow, and alsoplayed a role in spiritual life elsewhere.REB YUKELE SHENBERGANDTHE KAMIENICA FAMILYReb Yukele Shenberg b/m, the son of Reb Yosl and son-in-law of the first rabbi ofChrzanow, was a brilliant scholar, and also a merchant with a broad perspective onpractical matters. He founded the dynasty, so to speak, of the Kamienicas. RebYukele built the first two-story brick house in Chrzanow for his family. It faced ontothe marketplace. Because this was the first brick building of any significance in theentire city, it was called the "Kamienica" (brick house), and still bears that name to-day.25Chrzanowcommotion that to this very day, I can't understand how this could hap-pen among Jews..."Since neither side was willing to surrender, the community decided to keep thepeace by paying salaries to both rabbis. By law Reb Yosef Elimelech was the officialrabbi of Chrzanow, but the townspeople themselves considered both Reb Naftoliand Reb Elimelech to be rabbis with equal status.In time the two rabbis divided the spoils between themselves—that is, both ofthem had their respective spheres of influence among their loyal supporters.This "dual rabbinate" continued for about a decade, until the untimely death ofReb Yosef Elimelech b/m.Reb Yosef Elimelech, whom nature had blessed with physical beauty and otherpersonal advantages, and who in addition was very wealthy, immediately won thehearts of the people of Chrzanow. Not only his supporters but even his opponentsbecame fond of him and had great respect for him. When Reb Yosef Elimelech b/mdied in 1907, still a young man and under tragic circumstances, all the Jews ofChrzanow, without exception, mourned for him honestly and properly.In praise of the Jews of Chrzanow, it must be said that they learned a great dealfrom this dispute over the rabbinate. They drew the proper conclusions from theirexperience, for after the death of Reb Yosef Elimelech, the family proposed that hisyoungest son Leybele be elected in his stead. However, the city remembered its oldwound, and didn't support this suggestion.Reb Naftoli b/m thus became the only rabbi of Chrzanow, although he was notrecognized by law as the rabbi of the town.Reb Naftoli died in the year 1924. His son was named to replace him while thefather was still alive.REB MENDL OF BLESSED MEMORY:THE LAST RABBI OF CHRZANOWRabbi Mendl, with the disputes of his father and grandfather behind him, con-solidated the rabbinate of Chrzanow. He was intelligent and energetic, and he knewhow to carry out his responsibilities while displaying sympathy for all sides. Duringhis tenure, the old enmity between the Radomsker and Sanzer Chasidim cooleddown considerably.The last and most tragic rabbi of Chrzanow was fated to join his entire congrega-tion when they went as martyrs to Auschwitz during the time of Hitler, in 1942. Maythe Lord avenge their blood!24Rabbis in Chrzanowworthy of the several brothers. During his lifetime, Reb David had also expressed hispreference for Reb Naftoli. But then an incident took place that caused much badfeeling in town. A dispute broke out that did not reflect well on the Jewish city ofChrzanow.The previously mentioned Reb Yosef Elimelech had been his grandfather's favor-ite while his grandfather was still alive. Unusually gifted, he was a fine speaker, anextraordinary leader of communal prayer, and on top of everything, quite wealthy.Concisely—Torah and greatness in one. Reb Yosef Elimelech, whom Reb David hadsought to proclaim rabbi of Jaworzno, allowed himself to be called "Our Teacher andMaster," and strove to obtain the Chrzanow rabbinate after his grandfather's death.Thanks to his personal qualities Reb Yosef Elimelech quickly gained a party of sup-porters in town, among whom were the Radomsk Chasidim, who were still moti-vated by their enmity to Reb David and consequently to his son Reb Naftoli as well.The dispute over the rabbinical position in Chrzanow between Reb Naftoli on theone hand, and Reb Yosef Elimelech on the other, took on a very dramatic character,especially because of the intervention of the Shinewer Rabbi, the author of theDivrey Yechezkel, a brother of Reb David who was very famous at that time.The Shinewer Rabbi was on Reb Naftoli's side. Of course, the Shinewer Rabbi'sword carried a great deal of authority, and in the beginning it seemed that Reb Naf-toli would be victorious. But Reb Yosef Elimelech's supporters didn't remain idle,either. They used freely their most formidable weapon—money, of which Reb YosefElimelech had plenty.According to Austrian law in force at that time, a rabbi could not be elected unlesshe had at least an elementary school diploma. In other cities the authoritiesoverlooked this detail during rabbinical elections. In Chrzanow, however, thedeciding factor turned out to be not the Jewish scholarship of the various candidates,but rather the question of the elementary school diploma. This, in turn, was theresult of the explanations that one of the sides provided to the authorities.According to the election results, and by bribing the necessary parties, Reb YosefElimelech emerged the apparent victor. But although the election was consideredvalid, the dispute did not end there; on the contrary, it became even sharper. Thefollowing description by our fellow townsman, Lipa Hirshberg, illustrates the formsthe dispute took:"During the dispute over the rabbinate, or as it was called, 'the greatdispute,' I was barely nine years old. I sat at the third Sabbath meal in thegreat synagogue with my father, may he rest in peace, who was on RebYosef Elimelech's side. We were together with a crowd of Jews, singingreligious melodies in the darkness. Suddenly stones began flying throughthe window, and a crowd of supporters of the other side broke into thestudy house shouting. A fight broke out, just as if—(pardon the com-parison)—we had been in a tavern. Many heads were bashed, beards torn,shtreimelech stepped on, and silk overcoats ripped. There was such a23Chrzanowstreets were packed with people. Everyone wanted to be in front, to get abetter view of the excommunicated man. My father held me up in his armsso that I could see better. It was a terrible picture. A Chasidic Jew came outof a house; he was pale and terrified, and his face was full of sorrow. Hewore no hat, and had nothing on his head but a yarmulke. He had noshoes, only socks, like on Tisha B'Av. In this fashion the Jew walked fromhis house to the large synagogue. All the way boys threw stones at him,while the adults shrank away from him, in order to avoid proximity. Iclearly saw him being struck by a stone in the face, and his face coveredwith blood. As if the stone had struck someone else entirely, the Jew con-tinued to the synagogue. I don't know what happened in the synagogue,because my father couldn't get inside with me."This event ignited a burning enmity toward Reb David on the part of the RadomskChasidim, which was inherited by his son, who took over his rabbinical post. The af-fair of Reb Heshe Gross drew out like a red thread through further disputes, as wewill see later.Reb David b/m later suffered considerable troubles and anguish on account ofvarious libels that were brought against him to the authorities, stemming from theexcommunication episode. He had to hide for a certain time, because plans to puthim in prison were discovered. It was said that a special cell had already been pre-pared, cleaned and whitewashed for the rabbi, but influential Jews and a huge sumof money saved Reb David from this disgrace.Several years before he died, Reb David was fated to suffer another kind ofanguish. When the rabbinical post in the nearby town of Jaworzno became free, RebDavid allowed his son (Reb Moyshe the Rabbi's son, who, incidentally, was abrother-in-law of Zionist leader Ahad Ha'Am), to convince him to place his grand-son (Reb Moyshe's son) in the position, despite the fact that a highly respectedTalmud scholar, Reb Vove Rosenblum b/m, was also a candidate for the post. RebDavid wanted to force the acceptance of his grandson Reb Yosef Elimelech as thenew rabbi, and he rode to Jaworzno to influence the outcome of the affair. But oncethere, Reb David realized that he had not considered public opinion in the communi-ty. Jaworzno wouldn't let itself be bullied into a decision, and Reb Vove was electedby a large majority.On the Sabbath when Reb David was in Jaworzno, his supporters stole the Torahscrolls from the local study house, so that his opponents would not be able to readthe weekly Torah portion. And, even more shameful, the Torah scrolls were laterfound hidden in someone's bed.TWO RABBIS AT THE SAME TIME;REB NAFTOLI AND REB YOSEF ELIMELECH OF BLESSED MEMORYReb David b/m died in the year 1894. The only one of his sons who was consideredas a possible successor to the rabbinate in Chrzanow was Reb Naftoli b/m, the most22Rabbis in Chrzanowfinding a new rabbi. Since, in accordance with the terms of Reb Shloymele's will,none of his sons would take over the rabbinate, Chrzanow was without a rabbi forroughly two decades. The legal functions of a rabbi were carried out by the chiefjudge, Reb Nechemye Pozner b/m.During this time Sanz also cast its influence over Chrzanow. Clearly, personal fac-tors were no longer decisive in this process, but rather the “court" of Sanz. Thus,the vacant rabbinical post in Chrzanow went to the first rabbi of the Halbershtamdynasty, Reb David b/m.In contrast to Reb Shloymele's rabbinical tenure, Reb David's may be described asan unhappy experience, despite the fact that Reb David was a great authority in therabbinic world. As the son of the Divrey Chaim, the famous rabbi of Sanz, Reb ChaimHalbershtam, he lacked the pride and faith in himself which his great father hadpossessed. He wanted to copy Sanz, and what came out was indeed no more than amere copy—in a poor edition, at that.While Reb David occupied the rabbinical position in Chrzanow, a major conflictraged between Sanz Chasidim on one hand, and Radomsker Chasidim on theother—or more accurately, between Radomsker Chasidim and Reb David. Ap-parently this dispute was based on a local conflict, because as everyone knew, theSanzer Rabbi had written an introduction to the book called Tiferes Shlomo, writtenby the founder of Radomsk Chasidism; in addition to which, the son of the firstRadomsker Rebe, the author of the Chesed VAvrohom, was a devoted follower of theSanzer Rebe, and often went to Sanz for the Sabbath. The dispute reached its climaxduring an affair involving Reb Heshe Gross. One of the most respected citizens ofChrzanow, this scholarly Jew owned the tobacco monopoly at the time, and was arespected Radomsker Chasid. The well-known writer Gershom Bader describes theReb Heshe Gross affair in his memoirs, published in the New York Morning-Journalin 1938. I cite from memory:"I was born in Oswiecim. At the age of five, my father said to me: 'Mychild, I want to take you to Chrzanow. I'm planning to travel there, andthere you'll see something that's a once in a lifetime occurrence. And sinceI don't know whether you'll ever have the chance to witness such a scenein your lifetime, I want you to see it as a child.'"In Chrzanow there was a Jew by the name of H. Gross. During the bit-ter battle between Sanz and Sadigura, this Jew had expressed sympathyfor the Sadigurer, using an impolite epithet against Sanz. This led to theman's being excommunicated by the rabbi, Reb David. This Jew sufferedgreatly from the ban, because according to the law, Jews were not allowedto have anything to do with him. Even his own wife and children wereforced to keep their distance from him. In order to annul a ban of excom-munication, it is necessary that the excommunicated person undergo cer-tain public forms of humiliation, by means of which he is freed of his sin,or whatever caused the ban. The day my father took me along toChrzanow was the day H. Gross was to undergo these humiliations. The21Chrzanowthe study house. He sat studying the Torah day and night, carrying on extensive cor-respondence with the Torah luminaries of his generation, especially with the above-mentioned Meor veShemesh of Cracow. The following legend has been handed down,and it can serve as a measure of his influence on the Jews of Chrzanow and their in-destructible faith in him:One Friday before dawn, Reb Shloymele stood at the entrance to thestudy house, holding a letter addressed to the Meor veShemesh in Cracow(about 40 kilometers from Chrzanow). A young boy arrived just then withhis tefilin under his arm, planning to pray with the first minyan. (The boywas the grandfather of Moritz Feltsher.) Reb Shloymele said to him, “Beso good, child, as to go to Reb Kalman in Cracow and hand this letter tohim. Wait for Reb Kalman to write his reply on the other side of the paper.Meanwhile, I'll hold onto your tefilin until you return." The boy didn'task any questions. He went to Cracow. Returning with the reply, themessenger found Reb Shloymele still standing at the same place, and theboy still managed to pray with a minyan...Despite his diligence as a scholar, Reb Shloymele devoted a great deal of time andenergy to community affairs, especially charity. He often made the rounds of thehomeowners to collect money, so that he could distribute it among those who wereashamed to ask for money themselves.Honored and esteemed by the Talmud scholars of the time, and beloved by themasses, Reb Shloymele also had a great deal of influence on the noblemen andpeasants in the countryside surrounding Chrzanow. According to various legends,the Gentiles of the area had a great deal of respect for the holy rabbi, and his wordwas law even to them.His modesty and honesty were legendary. His creed was that the Torah should notbe exploited for material benefit. For Reb Shloymele, “the Torah for its own sake"was the highest value in life. He did not publish his letters and Torah insights,preferring instead to distribute them among his children. The extent to which RebShloymele refused to view the rabbinate as a source of income may be seen from hiswill, which he left to his children and his children's children: he forbade them tobecome rabbis. Although some of his sons and grandsons became major scholars,they were true to the will of their great father and grandfather, until they died duringthe days of Hitler.Reb Shloymele died in Chrzanow on Lag Be'Omer in the year 1819. Thousands ofJews from Chrzanow and from other areas near and far would gather together fromtime to time to pour out their bitter hearts at his grave, weep their troubles away, andgather hope that they would be helped by Divine providence thanks to the merit ofReb Shloymele, b/m.REB DAVID (DOVIDL) HALBERSHTAM OF BLESSED MEMORYAfter the death of the great Reb Shloymele, Chrzanow did not have an easy time20Rabbis in Chrzanowto the correct page, and asked the boy to explain the passage which had so confusedthe members of the Council. The boy scanned the entire page of the Talmud, andopened his eyes wide, as if to ask his father, "What's so hard to understand here?"At that, his father rewarded him with a resounding slap and angrily said to hisson: "Several luminaries of the Torah are sitting at the fair struggling to understandsuch a complicated topic, and for you there's no difficulty whatsoever?"The nine-year-old boy replied: "You see. Father, it would indeed be a difficultquestion, unless you remember what the Talmud said four pages earlier. If you com-pare the two, you will see that the meaning is clear and simple, and there's no needto apply fancy interpretations to it."His father, abashed, kissed his child on the forehead and said, "May his kindmultiply in Israel."Of Reb Shloymele's earlier years, all we know is that he studied with the earlyChasidic Rebe, Reb Shmelke in Nikolsburg, and that the "Seer" of Lublin was hisclosest friend. He was a unique personality, remarkable for his unusual modesty. Acentury and a half ago, already a well-known star scholar in Poland, he did not seekto assume a rabbinical pulpit, but instead decided to learn a trade, so that he couldsupport himself without depending on the organized community and those whocollected its revenues. In fact, he worked as a goldsmith in his earlier years, and hesupported his wife and children from his income at this trade.Having such a great scholar among them, the prominent men in town approachedhim to ask that he become their rabbi. However, Reb Shloymele categorically refused,explaining that he didn't want the Torah to become a source of material benefit.Realizing that they wouldn't get anywhere with Reb Shloymele, the committeeturned to his wife, the future rebetsin Hese, trying to convince her to influence herhusband to accept the rabbinical position. Like every wife who wants to have a rabbias a husband, she criticized him sharply for his stubbornness, even threatening todisrupt the tranquility of their home. One time Reb Shloymele responded to herwith the famous pun, "You should love your work, even if it leads you to oppose therebetsin."It wasn't until the committee approached Reb Shmelke, who ordered his studentto take the rabbinical post in Chrzanow and backed up the order with his own rabbin-ical authority, that Reb Shloymele agreed to become the rabbi of the city.Reb Shloymele's greatness was centered in his simplicity. He had no pretensionsto establish a rebe's court, nor did he consider the rabbinate to be a position with astatus above that of ordinary people. In contrast to his comrades, such as the above-mentioned Seer of Lublin, Reb Kalman of Cracow, the author of the Meor veShermesh;and Reb Berish Ospitziner, he led a poor and modest life, following the authenticway of the founder of Chasidism, Reb Yisroel Baal Shem Tov. Like the Baal ShemTov he was involved with the simple people, the masses. It is well known that heeven helped establish a congregation of completely unlettered men in Chrzanow, sothat they wouldn't have to feel inferior to the Talmud scholars in the study house.Reb Shloymele and his family lived in an area that later became the back room of19Rabbis in ChrzanbwTHE FIRST RABBI OF CHRZANOW, REB SHLOYMELE BOCHNERWITHOUT A DOUBT the high point in the rabbinical history of Chrzanow is occupiedby its first and most significant rabbi, Reb Shloymele him. In fact it can fairly be saidthat Chrzanow's history as a Jewish city began only when it hired its first rabbi. Thefact that Torah and work went hand in hand in Chrzanow is largely the result of theefforts of its beloved and unforgettable rabbi.Reb Shloymele was bom in Olkusz. His father was Reb Moyshe Charif, one of thelast members of the Council of the Four Lands. His name itself ("charif" meanssomeone with a sharp mind) bears witness to his greatness in Torah. As a member ofthe Council of the Four Lands, which met at the major fairs at set times, he played aconsiderable role in regulating the religious and social life of the Jews in Poland,Lithuania, and other areas.Little is known about Reb Moyshe Charif's activities or his influence, because hewas an extremely humble man all his life. He sought no publicity while he was alive,nor did he leave behind any writings that might have cast more light on his life andworks. His most characteristic traits were modesty and simplicity. He didn't want toturn the Torah into a source of income. His son inherited these qualities from him.While still a boy of eight or nine years, Reb Shloymele was noted for his diligenceand his straightforward approach to study. An enemy of artificial disputation, healways sought the clearest and simplest interpretations, rather than the twisted,uncertain strategies of interpretation that did so much harm to the minds of theyeshiva students and those who sat in the study houses at the time.It is said that one time his father, Reb Moyshe Charif, attended a very long sessionof the Council of the Four Lands at a fair in a large city in Poland. The session draggedon because the leading scholars present got involved in a dispute concerning a cer-tain point in the Talmud. They couldn't determine the plain sense of the text, andeventually Reb Moyshe Charif called out to them: "You know what, gentlemen? Ihave a nine-year-old son at home in Olkusz. With his brilliant mind, he'll get us outof this confusion." They immediately decided to hire the swiftest pair of horses, sothat Reb Moyshe could ride home to Olkusz to ask the boy what the proper meaningof the text was, and all the scholars stayed at the fair to wait for the answer.Arriving home at Olkusz in the middle of the night, Reb Moyshe immediatelywoke up his Shloymele, who was sound asleep near the warm oven. After the boyhad washed his hands and rubbed his sleepy eyes, his father opened up the Talmud18Occupations of the Chrzanow Jewstailor, a scholar to be reckoned with, and a man with a record of good works, wasthe preacher at the Psalm Society, and simultaneously the First Officer of the burialsociety. Reb Zismel Shames, the secretary of the town study house, knew the entireMishna by heart. Dr. Itzchak-Schwartzbart, who became the pride of Polish Jewry,was an innkeeper's son. Reb Yukl Bochner, a horse trader, a Jew with aristocraticmanners, and a philanthropist, was the chairman of the Jewish community for manyyears. An optician, Reb Avrom Hirsh Reifer, was a Belzer Chasid and a scholar.These examples illuminate the essence of Chrzanow Jewry.After the death of Reb Shloymele him, the first rabbi in Chrzanow, the rabbinicalpost remained vacant for many years, until a decision was made to fill it with RebDavid Halbershtam him, the son of the author of the revered Divrey Chaim. For thefirst Sabbath in his new position, Reb David was accompanied to Chrzanow by hisfather, the Rabbi of Sanz, Reb Chaim him. There was still no railroad station inChrzanow at that time, so the community ordered a carriage, driven by twoChrzanow coachmen, to bring the rabbis from the nearest railroad station atTrzebinia. During the trip, the two coachmen sitting next to each other in frontargued over a particular passage in the commentary of Tosafot on the Talmudic trac-tate Sanhedrin. Overhearing this dispute, Reb Chaim said to his son, "You hear,Dovidl? You'd better work hard. If the coachmen are such scholars, can you imaginehow brilliant the bourgeoisie must be?"When Dr. Natan Birnbaum him (Matisyohu Akhar) was in Chrzanow in the year1913, he related an anecdote that illustrated his personal impression of JewishChrzanow.• As is well known. Dr. Birnbaum was quite distant from Judaism and from Jewishlife in general in his younger years. Living in Vienna, he had only the slightest con-nection with the Eastern Jews. Even more: as he expressed it at the time, he felt a cer-tain contempt toward the "unproductive Ostjuden." Once, however, as he wastraveling through Chrzanow on the Sabbath, he looked through the window of therailroad car and saw something that radically changed his attitude toward EasternJews. He saw a coachman from Chrzanow, dressed in his Sabbath clothes—a silkovercoat, with a broad silk belt wrapped around his waist and a shtreimel on his head—leading his horse to the town stream to drink. This image, Matisyohu Akhar declared,motivated him to become more interested in the Jewish question in Eastern Europe.The observance of the Sabbath by the Jews of Chrzanow is extremely interesting.Despite the fact that Jews were in almost complete control of the economy, not oncedid a Jew keep his store or workshop open in public on the Sabbath. If other citieskept the Sabbath, Chrzanow kept the "Sabbath of Sabbaths." Even the Gentileshad to rest on the Jewish Sabbath. The synagogues and study houses were packedwith congregants. A sublime atmosphere reigned outside and at home, and Dr.Chaim Zhitlovsky put it well during his visit to Chrzanow before World War I:"Jews, you should be proud of your city. It is the Jerusalem of Galicia."17Chrzanowwho could afford the trip or who had relatives in America, continued further. But themass of poor and hopeless Jews, who possessed no material goods, remained inChrzanow. Since many of them were scholars, they settled there and becameteachers. These Jews initiated a certain revival, and influenced several generations ofstudents.Forty or fifty years ago (around 1900) it was impossible to imagine a boy who hadreached the age of Talmud study who hadn't spent several semesters with Reb YoslLipe, Reb Shloyme Kotsker, Reb Hersh Melamed, Reb Nute Dayan, or one of theother "Polish'' teachers. While not all of the teachers were from the other side of theborder, the majority of them, in fact, were not from Chrzanow. This diversity had acertain cosmopolitan influence on the Jewish youth of Chrzanow.We cannot deal with the subject of teachers without describing Reb Volf Shor, whowas well-loved by everyone and who was a pedagogue in the fullest sense of theword. He wasn't someone who turned to teaching because he had nothing else todo; rather, he was a teacher with character and a strong sense of responsibility. Bornand raised in Chrzanow, he had a profound knowledge of the German classicalliterature, and was at the same time a traditional Jewish scholar. In contrast to otherteachers, he placed the greatest emphasis in his teaching on the Bible, the Prophets,and the Writings, accomplishing wonders. Most of his students were the children ofsimple Jews and artisans, because the Chasidim harassed him, spreading the rumorthat he taught Moses Mendelssohn's Biur"P22" as a commentary to the Bible. But itwas an uncontested fact that when the Sabbath arrived, all of his students, even theones with "rocks in their heads," knew the weekly Torah reading along with theHaftorah like the backs of their hands. His students who are still alive today cantestify to that.It is beyond our scope here to describe all of the occupations of the Jews ofChrzanow. We only want to demonstrate that they were hardly idlers. Characters onthe model of Sholem-Aleychem's Menachem Mendl were hardly to be found inChrzanow. There wasn't a single area of the economy in which Jews were not heavilyrepresented. Jews in Chrzanow made their mark in trade, industry, and as artisans.With their hard work they made Chrzanow a major center of trade and productionthat was known throughout the business world.Furthermore, aside from their competence and success, they always remainedtrue to Judaism and the Torah, their tradition, and their ways of dressing.In contrast to other Polish Jewish towns, Chrzanow was unusual in that itsscholars in Rabbinic learning, its pious and God-fearing Jews were not necessarilythe most fiery Chasidim, but also simple merchants and storekeepers, tailors andshoemakers, artisans and horse traders, and so forth. There were several examples.Reb Moyshe Hochbaum, the well-known scholar and town preacher of Chrzanow,was the son of a shoemaker and himself a confectioner. Another shoemaker's sonbecame the rabbi of the nearby town of Kalwarie, Reb Avrom Neuhof. Reb ElyeShuster, also popular, repaired old shoes by day, while in the morning and at nighthe taught a Talmud class to older men in town. Reb Itshele Weitzenblum, who was a16Occupations of the Chrzanow JewsSczakowa. Each carried a leather pack on his back, which contained currency fromalmost every country in the world. Each of these men was a kind of walking exchangebureau. Although the large banking houses maintained exchange bureaus at the trainstations, most of the business of exchanging currency was in the hands of Jews. Thisdemonstrates that Jews enjoyed a good deal of trust in matters relating to currency ex-change.Naturally, the busiest season was the summer, when international traffic going tothe Austrian and German spas was heavy. At that time the money changers wouldride in the trains with the passengers, and exchange money according to the daily ex-change rates. The stations themselves were extremely busy at the beginning and endof the summer. The traffic consisted mostly of Polish agricultural workers who werebrought from the impoverished Polish countryside to do seasonal work in Germany.At those times the money changers had their hands full.Just as with the merchants, there were categories of money changers. Most of themlooked for customers among whatever passengers happened to be traveling through,and who might need to exchange money. Jews made enough to live on in this fashion.But there were also those who had an established clientele. The latter includedwealthy landowners, officials, and international playboys, who spent money casually.And the money changers who had the “better customers" grew wealthy from thistrade.Various anecdotes were told about a well-known money changer from theprevious generation, Reb Manes Shneider. Among his clients was the popular KingNikita of Montenegro, the father-in-law of the Italian King Victor Emanuel, and ofthe famous anti-Semite, the Russian Grand Prince Nikolai Nikolaievitsh, whoplayed a significant role as a European politician and engaged in intrigues among thevarious royal courts. This king, who often traveled between Rome, Vienna, and St.Petersburg, insisted on having his money changed only by Reb Manes. When he ar-rived at the border, the king would summon Reb Manes to his private car, take careof their financial business, and then seek his advice concerning world politics. ThisReb Manes Shneider was later robbed and murdered by unknown bandits in aborder town.With the fall of Austria, exchange as a form of commerce also virtually disap-peared, and many of the former money changers took up the rather dirty business oflending money out at interest. They were called chashtas (loan sharks), which wasvirtually a curse word in Chrzanow at the time.TEACHERSIt may seem curious, but nevertheless it is a fact that because of its geographicalsituation as a border city between Tsarist Russia and free Austria, Chrzanow had alarge number of traditional Jewish teachers.During the Russian anti-Jewish actions in the 1880s, as well as during the years1905-1906, masses of Jews escaped the pogroms and arrived at Chrzanow. Those15Chrzanowthe larger cities, such as Vienna and Prague, bought up various articles of usedclothing, brought them home, dyed and remodeled them. In time, seeing that therewas money to be made, they began to make finished articles of clothing from pieces ofnew fabric. In addition to the local market, outerwear and underwear gradually beganto be shipped and sold in the industrial regions of Merisch-Ostrow and Karvin.Workshops were established which, lacking capital, were limited to subcontractingto entrepreneurs, who sold the finished goods in the industrial regions.The tailors—both masters and apprentices—were poorly organized. This led to theirexploitation by the merchants and exporters. Because of their bad economic situation,many of the tailors emigrated in search of better living conditions.The first place the emigrating tailors went to was Berlin. The first pioneers who ar-rived in Berlin quickly worked their way up to a better situation on the strength of theirdiligence, competence, and willingness to work twelve-hour days. They opened theway for more tailors from Chrzanow to go to the same place.In Berlin, the tailors from Chrzanow created the basis for the German clothing in-dustry. Thanks to them, the Germans began exporting clothing to England, India, andSouth America. It is worth mentioning that the Berlin police force understood that anyespecially competent tailor must surely be from Chrzanow. The Chrzanow tailors inBerlin did not forget their home town. They created a Chrzanow Society in Berlin in1918, which did a great deal to help the Jews of Chrzanow as they arrived in Berlin, andwhich also raised money to benefit the existing philanthropic institutions inChrzanow.Tailors from Chrzanow also emigrated throughout the world, to places like Paris,New York, Montevideo, and others.Thus it is clear that the needle trades in Chrzanow were well established,flourishing, and ambitious. Before World War I Chrzanow aimed to catch up withthe Czech town of Prosnitz, which was famous in pre-World War I Austria for itshighly developed men's and women's clothing industry. These Czech-Germans ac-tually were affected by the competition of the Chrzanow tailors.After the Polish state came into existence, the tailors of Chrzanow had their first realopportunity to show their competence and their ability to produce on a much largerscale. With their endurance and industry they brought Chrzanow to the point where itwas independent of such larger clothing industry centers as Brzezin and Tamow. Anduntil the outbreak of Hitler's war, Chrzanow was one of the most importantcustomers for the textile manufacturers of Lodz, Bialystok, Tomashow, and otherlarge mills.MONEY CHANGERSA special economic niche was occupied by the money changers of Chrzanow. Sincethe city lay near the German border, and previously had been near the Russian borderas well, certain Jews of Chrzanow would accompany the Prussian merchants at thebeginning of the week to the border regions around Myslowice, Katowice, and14Occupations of the Chrzanow Jewsfrom the authorities; nevertheless, they got by with a good word at the right place,or by bribing the police. The authorities took cognizance of the fact that the Jewswere both well-liked by the population and economically useful, and did not openlyharass them. An elderly Jew from Chrzanow, Reb Lipe Hirshberg, relates the follow-ing:In my time, that is, in the years before 1914, Jews from Chrzanow wentto Prussia to do business. As a rule they were called Prusians. They left onSunday evening, and returned Friday before candle-lighting time. Offici-ally they were forbidden to spend the night in Prussia, but they did so onthe sly. If a violator was caught, he was supposed to pay a fine of twomarks. The most prominent of these merchants were the families Shmeker,Proloch, Soltis and others. They generally returned home Friday evening.They chartered a special train from the railroad company, which was calledthe Sabbath train; it ran from Katowice to Chrzanow. The Jews charteredthis train summer and winter. The train always arrived one hour beforecandle lighting. I remember that when the train arrived in Chrzanow, thewhole town was filled with joy. The cry,' "The Prusakes train has arrived,''rang throughout the entire city, and everyone was happy.When one observed the everyday routine of these Jews in the UpperSilesia cities of Katowice, Myslowice, Boytn and Hindenburg, it madeone's heart bleed. They had such a bitter and tiring life, struggling to makea living. They lived in dark cellar rooms and in narrow attics. The Jew wholooked like a poor Gypsy in the streets of Prussia, looked like anaristocratic rabbi, dressed in clean clothes in Chrzanow during the Sabbathsand holy days. Since they earned a good living, the Prussian merchants inChrzanow behaved like rich men: they gave to charity generously, sup-ported Jewish institutions, helped out poor scholars, and so forth.In general, Chrzanow was a prosperous city thanks to the bounty of thetrade with Prussia, and this also explains the attraction of Chrzanow forJews from elsewhere. Throughout the entire province, Chrzanow wasknown at that time as “little America."TAILORSThe clothing industry in Chrzanow began at the very beginning of the twentiethcentury. We aren't thinking here of the Jewish tailors like Reb Mordkhe Doydele, orReb Yitschok Aron, the kind who worked by the light of a tallow candle, and whorecited entire Psalms while they worked, or sang the melodies used during the HighHoly Days. Jewish scholars like these were to be found in great numbers in other Gali-cian and Polish towns—wherever Jews had settled. We mean here rather the clothingindustry under modem conditions of production.It was in Chrzanow that the so-called Vichres originally appeared. Nearly all ofthem lived on one street, which was called Vicharska Street. These people traveled to13Occupations of the Chrzanow JewsTHE ECONOMIC description of Chrzanow Jewry may be divided into two periods.The first part lasts until World War I. At that time Chrzanow still belonged toAustria, and therefore had economic connections with the west. The second periodbegins with the establishment of the Polish state. At that time the economy turnedits face toward the east.The first period is more interesting to us, because it had a more exclusively Jewishcharacter. The Austrian government placed no impediments in the way of Jewish in-volvement in trade and industry, so that Jews were able to develop their economiccapacities and achieve a certain degree of well-being. Thanks to the results achievedby the Jews of Chrzanow before World War I, they were able to maintain their posi-tions in independent Poland, despite heavy pressure from the Polish governmentand civil society.As in many Jewish cities and towns, so too in Chrzanow, the sources of income forJews were quite limited. We neither intend nor are we able to give, within theframework of this book, a full report about each branch of Jewish industry. We will,instead, suggest the particular character of our town in the following sections.PRUSSIAN MERCHANTSThe fact that Chrzanow was better off and more advanced materially than othertowns in Galicia was largely thanks to the Prussian merchants.To a very great extent before 1914, and to a lesser extent later, in independentPoland, a large number of the Jews of Chrzanow moved to Upper Silesia, which waspart of the Prussian region at that time, in search of a living. These Jews had neithertheir own businesses in town nor any particular artisan training, and therefore hadno other way to support their families.They would leave Chrzanow on Sunday and return on Friday. Most of them werefruit dealers. In time they got so proficient in the fruit business that they became themost important factor in this branch of the economy throughout Upper Silesia, andeven as far as Breslau. Others took up peddling, selling assorted textiles and alsofinished clothes to workers and employees on the installment plan.These Jews got along quite well with the German population. Their honesty andhard work earned them the trust of both the German and the Polish populations. Alaw from Bismarck's time was still in effect in Prussia, forbidding Galician citizens—meaning, for this purpose, Jews—to sleep in Prussian territory without permission12General OverviewThe pogrom continued from Wednesday, November 5 until Thursday, November 6.Crowds came in from the surrounding villages with wagons; those who didn't havewagons carried empty sacks. All of the stores were broken into, and their stock placedin the street. The police saw to it that Jews were neither allowed out in the street, noreven permitted to look out of their windows. The sum result was tragic: two dead(Hershl Wiener and a young boy named Grubner) and several wounded, who re-mained crippled all their lives (such as Mrs. Rosenwasser and Reb Chaim ShlomoRosenfeld). All of the stores were completely looted. Overnight, 70% of the Jews ofChrzanow became paupers. The economic catastrophe caused less anguish, how-ever, than the moral pain of those who had been free citizens before, and who nowhad lost their rights.For the sake of completeness it should be mentioned that some of the Jews ofChrzanow, especially the youth, acquitted themselves honorably against thelooters. Two were dead and several badly wounded on the other side as well.For some time after the pogrom, the Jews of Chrzanow were severely depressed.They simply no longer believed in the promise of a better tomorrow. They wereright; their instincts did not deceive them. Some time later a new trouble began, inthe guise of the "Hallerchiks," the Polish "liberation army," which the anti-SemiticGeneral Haller had assembled from the dregs of humanity overseas. Their first andmost successful combat on arrival in the country was their battle against Jewishbeards. They cut and tore beard and skin together from the faces of defenselessJews. On the other hand, when they met a Jew without a beard, they would beat himmercilessly for "failure to have a beard." These were the predecessors of the Nazis.The finale of the ongoing "cold pogrom" carried out by the Hallerchiks waswithout question the attack on the study house. They burst into the large bethamidrashin Chrzanow, beating old men and young boys who sat studying volumes of theTalmud. Afterward they forced everyone out of the study house, and with laughterand mockery drove horses into the holy place. This desecration continued for sev-eral weeks, while the old study house served as a horse bam in free and "glorious"Poland.Fifteen years later, in 1934, Polish Fascist hooligans began a pogrom once againafter the death of Pilsudski, but this time it was directed at the dead. In honor of theFirst of May they vandalized the cemetery in Chrzanow, uprooting a number ofgravestones. At that time this was still a rare occurrence.11Chrzanowbehind this project because of narrow partisan ambitions and differences of opinion.However, a short time later, Heinz did succeed in creating a non-party-affiliatedpopular library, with a rich catalog of Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, and German books.The popular library was established when Heinz placed at the disposal of the na-tional Jewish parties the huge sum of 5,000 kroner (an enormous contribution at thattime). Over the course of four decades this institution (Biblioteka Ludowa) served as asource of culture and knowledge for the Jewish youth of Chrzanow.World War I, although child's play when compared to World War II, neverthelessleft its mark on the Jews of Chrzanow. Some fell at the front, and some were crippledfor the rest of their lives. Many lost their entire fortune as a result of the war, whileothers became rich. There was also a certain spiritual transformation; the blind pietythat had formerly been such a distinctive mark of Chrzanow loosened. Conservativeattitudes toward people and the world gave way to more liberal and open views. Thereason for this was that at the end of 1914, when the Russians came near the city, alarge portion of the Jewish population left Chrzanow and settled in the larger citiesof the empire, such as Vienna, Prague, Berlin and others.This contact, short as it was, with the centers of civilization at that time, influencedthe people in several ways. When they returned, they felt more connected to theworld. For many young people, short modern clothes replaced traditional garmentssuch as the shtreimel, kolpak, the long silk coats—something previously unimagin-able in Chasidic homes. A certain change took place in the education of the youth aswell. People turned to training in practical and useful trades, instead of keepingstores and traveling to fairs, which had become insecure occupations during the waryears.With the collapse of Austria and the establishment of the Polish state, the tragicstory began in Chrzanow. Not only was there a pogrom, but Chrzanow had the"honor" of being the site of the first pogrom anywhere in liberated Poland.At the end of October 1918, Jews in Chrzanow found out through covert channelsthat an action was being prepared. Since the Jewish national youth in Cracow hadformed a self-defense organization, they were alerted to send a detachment toChrzanow to defend Jewish lives and property. In fact, Cracow sent a band of tenmen with arms—the youth of Chrzanow, unfortunately, were unarmed—but im-mediately upon their arrival, they were disarmed by the Polish authorities ontrumped-up charges.This pogrom, or rabunek as the Poles called it, had been prepared by the Polishauthorities as though they were old hands at the trade. Virtually every class withinthe Polish population participated in the pogrom, from the highest-ranking judge(Court President Wierszbycki) down to the lowest-ranking policeman, from thePolish intelligentsia to the underworld. The saddest moment came on November 5,1918, when the Polish workers of the Polish Socialist Party (P.P.S.) officially par-ticipated in this crude bacchanalia, and its leaders, including the future parliamentdeputy Zhulawski, who was an anti-Semite first and a Socialist second, played adestructive and traitorous role in the affair.10General OverviewUntil 1918 Chrzanow, along with the rest of Galicia, belonged to the Austrian Em-pire. The Jews there enjoyed complete civil equality, together with all of the peoplesof the former monarchy.Throughout all the years before World War I the Jews of Chrzanow lived in peaceand comfort, and had a steady livelihood. Industry, capability, an entrepreneurialspirit, and commercial skills guaranteed them solid and secure economic positionsin the city. Over the years, the relations between Jews and Poles were bearable. Noextraordinary anti-Semitic incidents could be found in a chronicle of life inChrzanow. Not until 1910 did Polish anti-Semitism first appear in the city, with thearrival of the educated priest and anti-Semite Dr. Kaminsky, who was the first topreach openly for economic combat against Jews.A significant portion of the land in Chrzanow belonged to Jewish converts toChristianity, the family Lowenfeld. This family deserves description, because theyhad a share in the development of the city, and most recently had made a significantcontribution to raising the cultural level of the Jewish youth.Little is known about the original patriarch of the Lowenfelds, except that being aJew, he maintained the commandment to buy an esrog on Sukkoth, and pronouncea blessing over it. The Lowenfeld family lived in a castle surrounded by a garden, inthe very center of the city. They had kept their distance from other Jews even beforetheir conversion. That is why Chrzanow Jews knew so little about life in their man-sion, or about the reasons for their conversion.After the Lowenfelds converted to the Christian faith, they behaved as loyal andpious Catholics, and they were more than once observed exhibiting the particularanti-Semitism of converts. (The oldest son. Dr. Wilhelm Lowenfeld, did not convert;he was already an adult when the conversion took place. He lived in Berlin andentered Hitler's crematoria as a Jew.) More remarkably, the mother, who had ini-tiated the conversion of the entire family, became, as a Catholic, a vicious anti-Semite.The important family members for our Jewish history were the two brothers,Adolf and Henryk. Adolf, who was well-known in town, was highly educated andwas employed as a high school teacher of German language and literature. Hetranslated the book of Job into Polish, and in general was interested in Jewishissues—from an academic standpoint. One may safely assume that it was he who in-spired his brother Henryk toward generous support of Jewish cultural institutions.Henryk, or Heinz as he was generally called by Jews, inherited the greater part ofhis parents' fortune. He lived the Bohemian lifestyle among the theatrical circles inParis, and his ambition was to make Chrzanow as fine and beautiful as possible.Toward that end he donated to the city the landscaped grounds that were namedafter him, the Alea Henryka, and which served the city as a beautiful spot for strollingand recreation.Heinz also tried to promote a project aimed at establishing a community center inChrzanow for all of the Jewish parties, from right to left. Unfortunately it is impossi-ble to determine who was responsible for the failure to realize this excellent idea. Atthe time it was understood that the Jewish parties were unwilling or unable to unite9General OverviewUNFORTUNATELY WE do not know exactly when Chrzanow was established. Prob-ably the city was settled and began to develop in the beginning of the eighteenthcentury.In its first years Chrzanow fell under the administration of the county seat ofOlkusz, in Congress Poland, about 25 kilometers from Chrzanow. A Jewish bookdating from that period contains a reference to the city of "Chrzanow, nearKoscielec." This suggests that the nearby village, which was the seat of the Polisharistocratic family Vodzhitsky, played a larger role at that time than the county seat,which became significant later on. Chrzanow first achieved prominence as a Jewishcity with the appointment of its first rabbi, Reb Shloymele of blessed memory.Chrzanow is located in the southwest corner of Poland, not far from the left bankof the small river Hechlo, which flows into the Vistula.Before World War I, the economic structure of the Jewish community of Chrzanowwas strongly influenced by its proximity to the so-called "Three Emperors' Comer,''the border dividing Russia, Germany, and Austria. The city lay on the main highwayconnecting Eastern and Western Europe. The railroad line from Czernowitz throughLemberg to Vienna passed through the town, connecting Galicia to Germany andSt. Petersburg to Rome. Naturally, the influences of eastern and western cultureswere felt among the Jews of Chrzanow, both intellectually and economically.Thanks to its favorable geographical location, Chrzanow could have undergonemuch more extensive economic development, were it not for the lackadaisical ap-proach of the city fathers in previous generations. According to the original plan, therailroad connection to the nearby Czech territory was to be built right in the center ofChrzanow. But those who ran the city in those days protested that the whistles of thelocomotives at night would disturb their sleep. Similarly, they rejected a plan tomaintain a regular Austrian military garrison, complaining quite practically that itwould be difficult to hold on to female Gentile servants if there were soldiersaround.In the 1870s a fire broke out in Chrzanow at a time when the Austrian crown princeRudolph was staying in Cracow. Many Jewish families, motivated by patriotism,had gone to Cracow to see the son of the emperor with their own eyes. They hadlocked their houses and taken the keys along. Thus the fire caused a dreadfulamount of damage. This great fire came to serve as the central date for an informallocal way of reckoning time. People would say that so-and-so had gotten married ayear before the fire, or two years after the fire, and so forth.8ForewordTHIS BOOK should not be understood and interpreted exclusively as a volume ofhistory. I had neither the intention nor the opportunity to dig among the dry archivesof history. Even if I had wanted to, the necessary sources—the municipal and privatearchival materials, chronicles of the Jewish community, burial society records, andso forth—are lacking.I have confined myself to a general description of an exclusively Jewish city thatonce existed in prewar Poland, emphasizing particular historical moments and theunique characteristics that made Chrzanow stand out among our Jewish towns.I recognize clearly that this book may not be of the highest literary quality. I amsure that a great deal here is worthy of criticism. May my dear townspeople forgivemy audacity. I have taken upon myself this difficult task, following the opinion ofour rabbis, who said:"Where there are no men, strive to be a man."Whether I have successfully met this challenge will have to be determined by oursurviving older and younger Jews from Chrzanow themselves.My intentions were the best, and I worked at this task as best I could. May thepages of this book, written with love and piety, serve as an eternal Kadish for theruined city, and the more than ten thousand Jewish lives cut off before their time.MORDECHAI BOCHNEREurope 1948New York, April 5, 1988Dear Friends:In 1947-1948, the late Mordechai Bochner, father of my dear lost school friend,Malek Bochner, undertook the enormous task of traveling through Europe to gatherphotographs, information and stories to write a book about our Chrzanow. He de-serves our thanks, admiration and we bless his memory for what he accomplishedunder the most difficult circumstances.Time has taken its toll. The pages of his book are disintegrating and the binding isfalling apart. Saddest of all, very few people are able to read it in Yiddish. The timehas come to correct this situation. I hope that with the cooperation of themembership and friends of the Chrzanower Association, I will be able to have itproperly translated and rebound into a new Yiddish-English edition.At the same time, I would like to get as many additional photographs as possible,properly dated and identified, to include in the new printing. This, my friends, is arequest to all of you who have or know about any photographs available to send mecopies or originals. I personally assure you that they will be handled carefully andreturned if so desired.I hope that you will respond soon and favorably.With many thanks from our President, Irving Wiener and myself, I remainThis is how the project started.Your response helped to make it a reality.Thank you.Always truly.ChrzanowIndescribably terrible was the sacrifice our people made, but we are on the way tobetter days. And this is the only comfort, when I think about the death of my hometown and the destruction of hundreds and thousands of sister cities and towns,which died together with you, my unforgettable home town.Jewish children, pick up the books that grew out of the creative history of our peo-ple, which stretches back more than three thousand years! Drink at the sources,nourish yourselves with love for our people, with the strength to suffer, with endur-ing faith. May these qualities make you, the generation which comes to embrace theentire Jewish people with love, happy in the State of Israel! Then our catastrophewill have served its purpose as a major episode in the eternal path of our people.6Part I Introductiondangerous days of the Blitzkrieg in London I thought of you, of the youth I spent inyour buildings. And when moments arrived that threatened to be my last, I suddenlysaw in the far distance the cemetery outside of town, next to the little stream Hechlo.To us children, that little stream seemed a great river, and its depths aroused deeprespect in us. I saw that cemetery before me more than once: the graves of our rabbis,and the hundred slips of paper with prayers inscribed on them lying on top of thegraves. And in the midst of this forest of graves I suddenly saw the two black marblegravestones of my parents: my good, intelligent mother and my generous, im-pulsive father who had a character pure as crystal... I see you again now...And now that poetry has ended! Nothing more is left. During the war I sentseveral letters from London to my home town by way of special messengers—parachutists. But I never received a single answer. And when the war ended, myfirst thoughts and my first letter were directed toward my home town of Chrzanow,and the city in which I later lived, Cracow. That time I received an answer fromMandelbaum, in Trzebinia, along with a photograph of my parents' grave. Aroundthe grave stand two Jews, one of them pronouncing the El Mole Rahamim, and twocandles burn on the grave. Thank you, dear brother, for this gift!And now I am writing these words, thousands of miles away from you, my townof Chrzanow! I am now in the largest Jewish city in the world, a city populated bytwo-thirds the number of Jews who lived in all of Poland before the war. In this citylive one-fifth of our entire people; in this city, a glorious, rich, busy Jewish life is lived.This city—New York—is a new source of continuity, and from it streams the eternityof our people. Far away, in Europe, millions of us died, slaughtered by a murderouspeople and their helpers, by beasts who preached to the entire world that they repre-sent a "higher morality.'' And here, a new Jewish life has grown up. And thus it hasbeen for thousands of years: destruction followed by development, and once againdestruction. But what remains is eternity.My town of Chrzanow, you have left us, you will never return to be part of Jewishlife. But we will not forget you! You shine in our hearts like the light of love.And this gravestone will remain as a monument to you. Your sacrifice was not invain. You are a part of the indescribable mass sacrifice of pain and tragedy, broughtby our people to the altar of humanity in the struggle against the forces of darkness,in order to make possible the sunrise of new joy in our glorious, millennia-longhistory: the rebirth of the State of Israel.Here, in the great Jewish city of New York, I stretch out my hand to you, to the ex-tinguished light of my home town.May its memory be blessed.And you, the remnants of my fellow townspeople, scattered throughout the entireworld—here in New York, in almost all the lands of the Americas and the five con-tinents, and in our State of Israel, where I saw you just a few weeks before thiswriting—all of you will honor this monument with your love.After a period of gruesome tragedy, we are marching further toward a sunnyfuture.5Chrzanowlater chapters. In short, Chrzanow was a well-known commercial city.The best merchandise in Chrzanow, however, was the Torah. The city was a for-tress of devotion and true piety. Religious devotion was so great in the town thateven those who weren't pious had to reckon with these sentiments. A good deal ofstruggle arose from this fact! Piety, deep belief, a deep intimacy with faith, formedthe essential tone and illuminated the life of the city.This piety was the real reason behind the struggles for and against Zionism, againstmodern ideas. It wasn't simply the backward reaction of benighted clerics. Therewas a real fear that the contacts of young people with the great ideas of the Gentiles,,with "the goyish," as their culture was called, would slowly choke and destroy thetree of Judaism. A real love of Judaism motivated those who followed paths thatwere not ours, the young Zionist generation who strived to reach new horizons, toachieve true freedom, to revive our people.The older generation, unmistakably, understood us well. But because theyunderstood us—with all the sharp intelligence of the Jewish brain—they struggledwith an especially dedicated stubbornness on behalf of the fortress of the past. Iwould more accurately say that we young people did not understand the older gen-eration. We casually dismissed them as backward, believing that they didn't under-stand us and wanted to confine us in a prison of intolerance. And the real motivationwas the older generation's great love for the Jewish people, their belief in God, in theMessiah and the Redemption. Our paths separated, but the same pillar of love forthe people led both generations. And today nothing remains of these hundreds ofcities and towns, nor of my town of Chrzanow. It was like a pearl among a string ofpearls. The string has disappeared, and so have the pearls.The life of our Polish towns, including Chrzanow, was wrapped in a uniquepoetry. This poetry cannot be described in words. Perhaps another Y.L. Peretz coulddo so, but not my own poor pen. Who possesses the poetry to describe the well inthe middle of the marketplace, around which Jewish women and children stoodwashing new dishes, preparing for Passover? Who can describe the glowing, almostmystical atmosphere of celebration that accompanied this task, as if people werepreparing for some kind of indescribable joy?I will never forget the winter nights when, still a child, I went to cheder to my firstteacher, the unforgettable Royte Lume. He was such a good, holy Jew! And yearslater I walked one dark night with careful tread through the slippery marketplaceand through a certain long, large courtyard, to a teacher of more advanced students,Volvele Schor. He was such a scholar, such a pedant, and an ill-tempered man—mayhe forgive me! I can still feel the pain of the pinches he dealt me. But I remember bothof them here with profound respect. The poetry of that walk to cheder still lies in myheart, and as I write these lines, I once again hold the little lamp, bearing a bit of oiland a wick, that fitfully illuminated my way and drove away the darkness, so that Iwould arrive safely at the cheder. I see you before my eyes now, my dear town ofChrzanow.I dreamed of you often during the terrible days of the last war. In the most4Part I Introductionof those sins we later had so much trouble and toil in our city.A few dozen kilometers past Trzebinia was Cracow. In our imagination, Cracowwas the center of the world. Children used to beg their parents to take them just onceto see Cracow. Once when I was very young, how happy I was when I rode all daywith my parents toward Cracow, passing the spa Alvernia (famous for its clean air),and continuing farther past Koshov, which was also famous for Polish ruffians. Tothis day, I haven't forgotten that journey. My mother's eyes, looking at me in thephotographer's studio, still glow in my memory.But Cracow wasn't the sum total of the wide world. In the other direction, therailroad led to another city like Chrzanow—Oswiecim, or Auschwitz, roughly eigh-teen kilometers from Chrzanow. As a young boy, I ran the whole way with somefriends, just to see who could get there first. This is the same Auschwitz where theGerman Nazis tortured millions of people, most of them Jews. Hitler entertained thenew arrivals at this hell for Jews with orchestras playing German music while maddogs were driven to tear the flesh of little children. Today a museum is there.But in old Chrzanow, not one of us ever dreamed that our fellow city wouldbecome an eternal symbol of our martyrdom. Oshpitsiner—as the Jews of Oswiecim(Auschwitz) were called—didn't care for people from Chrzanow too much. Many ofthe reasons for this rivalry applied equally to both sides. There was a contest in piety.Oshpitsiner thought of Chrzanower as slightly less pious Jews, and Chrzanowerthought the same way of the Oshpitsiner.This was the city through which Chrzanow had access to the wide world on itswest. In that direction lay Vienna, where the emperor reigned, the great city whereJews from Galicia often sought justice, for the highest court in all Austria stoodthere. Health was sought there as well, because the greatest physicians were inVienna. A "lightning express" train ran from Cracow to Vienna, which took only sixhours, compared to the usual ten hours, or the passenger local, which took fourteenhours.I remember the fight of the Chrzanow Jews in Vienna to get the "Lux Torpedo" tostop at their small station. I recall that for a short time they were victorious. Theywere in a hurry, the rich Jews from Chrzanow—the regular express was too slow forthem. But the main reason was jealousy of Trzebinia, because the lightning expressstopped there. How unforgettable were the long disputes, the heated discussions atthe marketplace and in the foyer of the synagogue, regarding the world-shatteringquestion of whether the lightning express would stop in Chrzanow or not, and thedepth and seriousness of the town luminaries' ambition for Chrzanow to enjoyequal rights as a center of European communications. How sincere and comradelywere these heroic struggles.And indeed Chrzanow wasn't just any town. Life bubbled over there. Anyonewho hasn't experienced the lively tempo of a Thursday fair at the marketplace has noidea what economic prosperity means. But that wasn't all. Chrzanow maintainedsolid connections with surrounding cities and towns as far away as Germany, Kato-wice, Myslowice and even Breslau. But you will learn a great deal more about that in3Chrzanowpoor, crooked streets.. .caricatures. But many of them are still vivid in my memory.I can't forget the street that was named after a famous Polish historian of the distantpast, Kadlubek. In a side street off this main street stood a crooked house; here Iplayed with other children in the courtyard of my grandmother s apartment. Goingdown that street after a rainstorm was like crossing the Red Sea. The long KrzyskaStreet (from the Polish word krzyz, which means "cross") left me with an almostmystical feeling of terror. The street was extremely long; funeral processions wouldmake their way down to the cemetery outside of town. In addition, Christians—tsabanes as they were called—lived on that street. For us children, that fact alone wasa source of terror.Krakowska Street had a place of honor. It, too, was long, like an artery runningdirect from the heart of our famous rynek (marketplace). The people who lived therewere a bit wealthier, and their houses were made of brick. The street extended to aspot that we dreamed of every Sabbath, when we stole away for a stroll toward theriver and the fields. That spot was called Piaski (Sand).But the most prominent place in my memory is reserved for the most beautifulstreet, the "aristocratic" street, which was called Alea Henryka (Henry's Blvd.). Onboth sides of the street, trees flourished and fine houses stood, along with the court-house, the municipal building, and the various offices that represented power andauthority in our city. This street, which was named after a converted Jew, continuedquite a distance to a suburb called Huta, where the Austrian military maintained itsheadquarters for years. This was the city's castle, and Huta is where I was born,because that is where my parents lived at first.I remember the major "battle" that was fought in our town about whether tomove the train station from the city proper to the suburb. The suburb won and, as aresult, every Friday afternoon hundreds of Jewish men and women ran from thetrain up the Alea Henryka in order not to be late for the Sabbath. It was an image thatetched itself deep into my memory. But for the older generation, Alea Henryka wasnot to be used on the Sabbath. It led to the forests, to hidden places near the stonequarry, and especially to a small forest in the midst of which was a large, excavatedsand pit. The younger generation amused itself there on the Sabbath and holy days.Mothers and fathers were distressed when their sons and daughters escaped intoGod's beautiful natural world. But the girls and boys paid more attention to the callof their blood than to the call of their parents.Another road led from the marketplace toward Jaworzno and Siersza, with theirlarge coal mines, and to the village of Luszovitze. Like rays of the sun, six roads ledfrom the marketplace in various directions; and the world toward which they ledwas, it seemed to us, a very large one.To one side was the famous place called Trzebinia. On the way there was a hill onlya few meters high, but in our childhood fantasies this hill was quite large. It seemedespecially large and tall when we were told that the Messiah had once stood on it,preparing to redeem the world. Looking down from the peak of the hill, however, hesuddenly saw Jews desecrating the Sabbath, and he went away. Perhaps on account2PARTIIntroduction"If a book has a chanceto reach one soul,write it.”—S.G.by DR. ITZCHAK SCHWARTZBARTTHIS BOOK is a gravestone, a monument to the murdered Jews of the Polish city ofChrzanow. It is dedicated to women, men, and children. I don't know how manydied—certainly about 15,000. They died because they were Jews. They died becausethey patiently prayed together for mercy, relying on Divine providence. They wereone large family, just like Jews in almost every Polish town, and that is why we cansay that they all died as martyrs. This is the monument for them, for my brothersand sisters—one monument for everyone.I close my eyes and in the darkness I see all of Europe, from the Ukraine to France,from Norway to Italy. Thousands and thousands of cities, towns, and villages occu-pied by Jews. Blood, blood, blood. Pale faces, dying children, and then—ashes,ashes, ashes. Six million murdered Jewish hearts, and in the middle ofEurope—Poland! All around a huge wreath of Jewish ruins, rivers of Jewish tears,voices uttering Jewish prayers, and in the middle, the great Jewish plain of ashes—Poland, the mass grave of millions of Jews.Among the hundreds and hundreds of Polish cities and towns—with the proudJewish Warsaw in their midst, like the heart of a vibrant body—among these hun-dreds of Jewish towns, my eyes wander, seeking the town where my cradle stood,where my mother sang lullabyes, where my grandmother happily gazed at me as Itook my first uncertain steps on the road of Jewish life.In the southwest comer of Poland, where the rails cut through the crust of theearth on a broad path from east to west, lived and dreamed a large town among thesmall towns of Poland. Its name was Chrzanow. It still has the same name, but todayno Jews remain there. After the war the boundaries changed, but before World War II,Chrzanow was near the border of Germany, the majority of whose people becamethe beasts of humanity.In the first day of the war Chrzanow fell into German hands. I remember onepitch-dark night. I was returning by automobile from the last meeting of the PolishParliament in Warsaw, trying to get to Cracow to my wife. We were not far fromMielec, not far from Tamow. Suddenly the headlights of a car blazed. Hundreds ofdark figures were running in the direction of Rozwadow. I asked what they wererunning from. They were Jews from Chrzanow and Jaworzno. Already drawn intothe net of the Polish tragedy, they were running toward their own destruction.Now, after the flood has already passed, I ask myself what my town, our town, ofChrzanow really was. I close my eyes again and go back through the decades. I try torecall the true image of Chrzanow. Its streets were like those in Chagall's

where Jews once lived, ourtown of Chrzanow was one of the important centers of Jewish life. Its Jewish popu-lation was saturated with culture and learning, rich in folklore, deeply immersed inreligious life. The German occupation of Poland, and the complete, disastrousdestruction of Polish Jewry that followed, has laid waste the Jewish population ofChrzanow. The scant number of survivors no longer have a home, nor even a graveor marker at which to shed their tears of bitterness and suffering. But Hitler'sdemonic plan to erase the Jewish folk from the face of the earth did not succeed.Even among the few survivors we found people with considerable talents.The author of The Original Book of Chrzanow, Mr. Mordechei Bochner, was such aman. He undertook the difficult task of commemorating our town, Chrzanow—itspeople, its lifestyle, its joys and sorrows, its pleasures and pain, its devotion toreligion and to God, its respect for fellow men, its exuberance and its sadness. Indire circumstances at the war's end, with the pain fresh and the ashes still smolder-ing, he wrote this book, thus erecting a lasting monument to be handed downthrough generations to come. For half a century we, the survivors, read and rereadthe book until its pages crumbled, worn by use and time.A new generation of Chrzanower descendants has grown up, and we, the sur-vivors, were burdened with the obligation to pass on our legacy. And again amongus we found a man, Solomon (Shlamek) Gross, willing to undertake the enormousproject of republishing the book. But Shlamek also decided to improve andperpetuate the legacy we are leaving behind. He had the book translated from theoriginal Jewish into English, to make it accessible to a wider readership. He also addedpreviously unavailable pictures, wrote appropriate captions, revived long forgottennames.Only a man of Shlamek's ability and perseverance could cope with such a tremen-dous undertaking. He sent out mailings to Chrzanower all over the world, whereverthey could be found, to assemble original pictures. He kept strict, systematic files ofthe pictures, properly indexed to assure their return to the owners. He workeddiligently with translators, copyeditors, photographers, designers, and printers. Hespent hours, days and months arranging pictures and words, seeking the best wayto convey expressions almost impossible to translate into English. He conferred withprofessionals and friends repeatedly reading and correcting proofs, all at his own ex-pense.He marveled at and was swept up in that labor of love for which he hadvolunteered, and we are all deeply indebted to him. The most important reward thatShlamek will receive will be the knowledge that he was instrumental in andsinglehandedly responsible for making the republication of The Book of Chrzanowpossible, and leaving this fine legacy to our future generations.Helen Sendyk StaplerFor the Chrzanower Young Men's AssociationIrving Wiener, PresidentSimon Feinsilber, Vice PresidentHelen and Abe Sendyk, Financial SecretariesNelly and Ely Blumner, Corresponding SecretariesSalo Tauber, TreasurerIn MemoriamThe Chrzanower Y.M.A. dedicates the second printingto the memory of its publisher,SOLOMON (SHLAMEK) GROSS.A Word From The PublisherMy undertaking is finished now. At this point I would like to share with you mythoughts and feelings about this project.The committee of the Chrzanower Association and all my friends have constantlygiven me encouragement and praise, for which I am naturally grateful. I would,however, like everyone to know that I consider myself very privileged indeed tohave had the opportunity to do this work and to reawaken the memories of ourfriends and neighbors who have not been as lucky as we are.More important yet is my hope that this book will reach future generations ingeneral and especially those whose origin happens to be Chrzanow. Some mightmake their first acquaintance with grandparents, uncles or aunts they never knew.Let them learn and reflect about their yearnings, ambitions and behavior. Let themcompare these with those of the youth of today: The past often hides answers for thefuture. It is very sad that this is all we can offer to show those lost that they have notbeen completely forgotten and that their sacrifice will contribute greatly to prevent atragedy of this magnitude from happening again.Solomon GrossWith thanks to those who were helpful with information and photos.Max BochnerRyfcia BochnerItzchak BaconMania FrishRegina GangerMoniek GangerMendek GerstnerBerek GrajowerGusta (Schnitzer) JakubowiczHanka KatzDavid KatzLusia KriegsteinRoman KriegsteinTonka (Kunstlinger) ReisigHela KoniecpolskaFran LauferLeika LauferBernice LevenfussAbe MandelbaumRozka MandelholzMania MarmorTosia MarmorMendel MondsheinMala OpenheimRozia ReiferJacob (Smoczek) SchlesingerFela SharfBrucha SchwartzRachel SpangeletHela StaplerKurt TuskJosek WeinerSrulek WienerChamek ZagiorskiJack ZisnerMaryla ZolmanChrzanower Association in IsraelContentsA Word from the Publisher• •VllAcknowledgementixChrzanow MartyrsxiPart IIntroductionForewordGeneral OverviewOccupations of the Chrzanow JewsRabbis in ChrzanowProminent Folks of the CityThe Educational Institutions in ChrzanowPhilanthropic InstitutionsThe Jewish Nationalist MovementJewish Students in ChrzanowLeisure ActivitiesFolkloreHow Goodly Are Your Tents, O JacobPart IIIntroduction 80Before the War 82The First Judenrat 90The Year 1941 99The Year 1942 104The Year 1943 111Reb Moyshe Bochner—A Tear for My Father 119Supplement 12617912182542475158616677CHRZANOW: The Life and Destruction of a Jewish ShtetlEnglish Translation Copyright © 1989 by Chrzanower Young Men's AssociationTranslation by Jonathan BoyarinCopyeditor: Mary SmithEditor: Solomon GrossAll rights reserved.
