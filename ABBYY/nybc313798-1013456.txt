Some had seen them, some had heard theirwailings, others had noticed lights in the windows, a few, even whilepassing near it, had been called by their names. Once a man, who fellasleep during the evening prayer and was left behind, was suddenlyawakened by a voice calling him by his name. When he opened hiseyes he found the whole place filled with strange human beings wrap-ped in white. One of them had been reading from the scrolls — hewas invited to join in the prayers, and he did — he died the same year.This and many other weird stories used to be told at the late hours of thenight. They used to make me shiver, yet I loved to listen to them.Many years have passed since then. In my wandering over the worldI have visited many temples, many places of worship, some grand,others beautiful, but none equalled the one I remember so well.Fate brought me to my native place. With a beating heart I hurriedmy steps to that dearly beloved spot, but to my despair only a fewstones, half-burie din the ground, met my bewildered gaze. It hadbeen burned to the ground some years ago by a fire which suddenlybroke out. It disappeared together with the flames, it was said, beforethe people had time to regain their breath. It went straight up intoheaven. An old man told me it was taken away from us because wewere no longer worthy of it.On the same spot, and at the same hour every night, the souls of thedeparted from the not far-off cemetery meet together and pray andweep over the loss of the grand old synagogue. People have seen themwith their own eyes, and some have heard their wailing, but no onehas ever since seen any lights.120YEDWABNETHE OLD SYNAGOGUEby Abramam BlumowiczIt was a very old, strange, and mysterious-looking wooden building,black with age, but still keeping erect and firm like some old manwho, though white and wrinkled with years, still holds himself upright.How old it was no one could tell. Some thought three-hundred, othersfive, and a few ventured as much as a thousand years. Even the oldestinhabitants never remembered it looking any newer. Nor was it knownwho the builder was, where he was born, or died. Maybe his boneslay buried in one of the nameless graves of the not far off cemetery,wherefrom the upper part of this structure could be distinctly seen,and sometimes, even the reverberation of the prayers from it plainlyheard. Judging by its fine and impressive outlines and practical design,he must have been a man of rare artistic abilities and sound commonsense — a combination not very often found in a single individual —and if one considers the time when he lived, he must really have beena remarkable man. Though it was not built in the usual fashion of asynagogue a stranger could never mistake it for other than it was. Hewould know as soon as he saw it — he need but to look at it once ortwice to grow solemn ; and bowing his head he would go in to payhomage. Three times a day, morning and evening without fail, everymember of the Community laid aside his daily task and hastened intoits walls to join in common prayer, their mixed plaintive voices fillingthe atmosphere all around with a kind of sweet, melancholy sadness,and sometimes bitter respair.It stood on an open ground surrounded on all sides by dilapidatedwooden houses, which formed themselves into crooked and narrowlittle streets with alleys constituting the principal part of the so-calledtown. It was square in its main outline with two sloping wings on twosides of it, right and left; a flat fantastic roof, projecting all aroundlike an umbrella, protected it from the rain. The inside did not greatlydiffer from the exterior — the same shapes but hollow like a shell;only its walls were not so black.It looked serene and impressive during the day, yet mysterious andawe-striking at night. Even the thickest darkness could not hide itsblack shapes — they stood out sharply, staring at you with their weather-beaten and dusty windows like the persistent and vacant eyes of acorpse. At that late hour only a few cared to come near it, but notone would ever dare to go within. It was believed that the spirits ofHISTORY AND MEMORIAL119The celebration of this Seder night left imprints on my soul. Now,when I perform the Passover service, I understand the meaning ofthe statement that each man in every generation is obliged to considerhimself as if he personally was redeemed from slavery into freedom.I have some garments which I wore that Passover as a reminder ofMoror, “ze sh’anu ochlim, al shum mah”. This garment that I keep,why? Because of the holocaust that befell the Jewish People duringWorld War II.lum bv isoatr? linnstTD •’iin bv *»nx3n nrn ino nxDXDtrarn mtr ’iSi niv ns ssn□•’■’n) nj?3"n118YEDWABNEAll products accumulated for the Seder and piled up at our workingplace had to be brought to the camp. There was great danger that theNazi guard might search through the unit and confiscate all the thingsthat we had so carefully saved, and in addition would administersevere punishment. Therefore, we needed the cooperation and helpof our Cappo (group leader) who was also a Jew. He gladly acceptedsharing the responsibility. He also advised us to make very smallpackages and to distribute them to many people, and he would seeto it that everything reached the camp in the best order possible.With joy and thanks to G-d that we had succeeded in our undertaking,we came to the camp. The Profound holiness of Passover made usfeel neither hunger nor weariness, although we had worked very hardall day without food. We did not touch anything that was prepared forus by the camp kitchen. Our block leader, a split personality and aPole, was informed in advance of our intention to celebrate the Pas-sover Seder, and he promised not to interfere with our observance.Nevertheless, we had to give him a big bribe beforehand, besides ashare of our meager food.When night fell and darkness covered the earth and no other lightwas permitted in the block, we managed to light several candles anddistribute them among the people lying in the bunks. A man guardedthe door in case an S.S. man should come unexpecteldy. We filledthe first cup and made kiddush by heart without any hagadot. Ayoung boy, twelve years of age, asked “Mah Nishtanat” saying, “Whyare we Jews different from other people?” Tears flowed from every-one’s eyes and question after question found each one pondering whyit is so. And since we had no hagadot, each one tried to give his owninterpretation of the eternal question of why do we Jews suffer somuch more than any other nation. Some brought out the idea that theMaror (bitterness) that we suffered is due to the fact that we tried torun from one Galut (place of exile) to another Galut because we thoughtthat what happened to our brethern yesterday will not reach us in thenew places today.All night long we were discussing the history of our people and whatwe expected in the future and what would happen if some of us wouldcome out alive. No one slept and all celebrated the Pesach the entirenight with tears and hopes. The discussion did not end until the gongrang that it was time to get up and go to work. And as it rang, wewished each other that we live to come out of this hell and againcelebrate the Passover as free people.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL117from Egypt”. All may life I could not grasp the meaning of this pas-sage until the advent of World War 11.Among the many experiences during the terrible period of time underthe furious German Nazi rule in Europe, when millions of Jews, youngand old, were mercilessly persecuted and destroyed, we, a group ofJews from all parts of Europe, made careful preparations to celebratethe Holiday of Freedom, Passover. Passover of 1943 was an experiencethat I shall remember always. The observence of it took place at Bir-kenau near Auschwitz, one of the greatest annihilation camps, builtby slaves to exterminate themselves and the innocent people that wouldfollow. Planning and preparations started right after Purim. Therewere many things to be taken care of. The main problem was how toget the two most necessary items, matzoh and wine for the Seder.★Greece, an independent, peaceful nation, was seized and brought underthe terrifying Nazi yoke. Many Jews were living there, especially inthe harbor city of Salonika They did not expect to be removedfrom their homes to be killed. They prepared matzot, raisins and otherthings for Passover. The Nazi machine took these unfortunate peopleout of their city just two weeks before their Holiday of Liberation.Many transports of Jews, Squeezed into unbearable sealed freight carsunfit even for animal, reached the last station of their lives — Bir-kenau. Their total Possessions were in the small package each tiedon his or her shoulder, and they were accompanied by lovely children,many of whom were carried in the arms of the parents. They wereseparated from their poor worldly goods by force, and the parents andthe children were sent to the gas chambers.At that time, I was assigned to a special unit, called by the peculiarname of “Canada”, whose job was to assort the belongings of assassin-ated Jews. Thus the worldly goods of the slain Greek Jews came to ourplace of work. We opened the miserable packages and to our surprisefound hand-baked matzot, raisins, and other necessary Passover pro-ducts carefully prepared for the Seder. With trembling hands, know-ing how meaningful these items were to the dying Jews, we hid themin a secret place to make good use of their sacred purpose. After hardand dangerous preparations in order not to be caught by the S.S. men,we finally accomplished our first task and hoped to celebrate thelovely Holiday of Freedom while being slaves in a concentration campunder the yoke of Nazi Germany.Erev Passover 1943 was a very busy day for our special small group.116YEDWABNEwas mureded through the hands of Rugalsky by a heavy piece ofleather from the horses harness.I saw with my own eyes how Mr. Avrom-Aaron Ibram was lying onthe street dead with a cross cut out upon his front breast. Chana-Yenta’s grand-daughter, a little girl of 3, was hiding in a chicken-coop, so a gentile took her out and threw her into a flaming fire likea piece of wood.No Germans took part in the actual murder day. — the opposite. Twoofficers came to the death-barn asking the murderers to let alive thefollowing professionals : shoe makers, tailors, carpenters and black-smiths, but the gentiles answered ; “we won’t allow a remnant of theJews to be left alive. Professionals we’ll supply from the Christians”.A brother-in-Law of Rugalsky tried to save someone, but was forcedto escape to Warsaw, otherwise he would have been killed by his owncronies. An American gentile who did not want to take part in theslaughter was also thrown into the flaming barn.In the barn the whole Jewish Community together with their ReveredRabbi Avigdor Bialystocky hugged and kissed, said ‘Vidui’ (Con-fession) and with Shma Israel and B’rocho of ‘Kiddush Hashem’ suc-cumbed to the flames.Michael (Screcky) Kuropatva was taken out of the barn and offeredhis life because the Russians had taken away his son, but he screamedout; “I want to go where the Rabbi and all the Yedwabner Jews go”,and returned into the flaming barn.Mr. Rodnicky who was police chief in Yedwabne before the Germansentered, didn’t take part in the atrocities. Aaron Dovid Kubzansky’swife and sister had tried to escape, but when they saw that their pur-suers would reach them, they ran into the water cutting open theirveins, in order not to go through embarrassment before being mur-dered. They killed Yankel the harness-man (rimarz) in his home.THE UNFORGETABLE PASSOVER OF 1943by Rabbi Chaim Yitzchak GreengrassThe Baal Hagadah says : B’chol dor v’dor chayav adam lirot et atzmok’eelu hu yatza m’mitzrayim. “In every generation we are obligedto consider ourselves as having personally participated in the exodusHISTORY AND MEMORIAL115In the beginning of 1944, the Germans sent out the first transportof Jews from Aushwitz. I was amongst them. But we went throughseveral concentration camps, such as, Buchenwald, Grosrozen and11-Kupering. Bavaria, where we remained until the end of March.My wife’s sister became very ill. She had a constant fever that wasdestroying her red blood cells. There was nothing in the camp to helpher. I worked outside so that I was able to get her enough onions andsour cabbage, and in this way I saved her. She is now in Philadelphia,U.S.A. with her three children.At the end of March 1945, as the American Army approached, weleft the camp on a death march and were driven deep into Bavaria.They had intended to destroy us there by drowning, but the AmericanArmy reached us in time.During this time my wife’s sister weighed only 23 kilograms. I carriedher on my back, for if I would have left her on the wagon, she wouldimmediately have been taken to the gas chambers in Dachau.I tell all this with a feeling of pride, that in spite of the deadliest ofcircumstances, I still remained a human being, woven and inspiredby Jewish Morals, while others stumbled, allowing themselves to belowered to the standard of wild beasts.★I’ve always helped people whenever and wherever it was necessary.As a result, wherever I go I often meet thankful people.On May 4, 1945 we were liberated by the U.S. 3rd Army in Buchbergnear Wolfrathausen in Germany. We were there under the U.S. Armyauspices until I married my wife.There is nothing to speak of Israel Grondowsky, for he did convert,and informed against many Jews of their hiding places thereby causingtheir immediate annihilation.The miller brothers Eliyahu and Moshe David Pecynowitz and theirfamilies were hiding in their flour mill during the destruction day at10 A.M., when Stashek Shilaviuk with other gentiles, such as theirneighbours Ludansky and Shnitshtuk from the village of Kosaki, ranto the windmill seeking out their prey and murderously beat them todeath. On the way lie murdered the daughter-in-law of Mr. ChoneGoldberg who was in the 9th month of pregnancy — her belly wascut open by Rukofsky the gentile who had previously worked for theGoldbergs. Mr. Goldberg and his son escaped, but the gentiles pursuedand caught them in the fields where they were murdered.Chatskell, the son of Shmuel and Peshe Weinshtein, the blacksmith.114YEDWABNELomza ghetto. Her husband David had been murdered by the Germans.I went to Lomza to help her with the children. We were there fortwo months. Then the Germans transferred the ghetto to Zambrowa.Being on the road from Lomza to Zambrowa I had many chancesto escape but I didn’t want to leave my sister with her children alone.We then received word that my sister in Bialystok had been sent tothe death camp of Treblinka.After four weeks in Zambrowa, the Germans poisoned the drinkingwater, and those who drank the water died. I managed to find goodwater and food to remain alive.From Zambrowa they transferred us to Aushwitz. They then separatedme from my sister. Later I found out that she and the children foundtheir death in the gas-chambers.In the camp of Aushwitz I received on my left arm #89879. I wasthere three years. It is impossible to describe what I went throughthose three years. Death would have been the easiest way out. But thedesire to remain alive and to be able to tell what has happened, andwhat our Polish neighbors did to us was very strong in me and keptme alive.One evening I was chosen to bring the Doctor. On the way I founda purse with diamonds and money. I gave it to one of the Jewishleaders of the camp. He was from Krakow, the son of a Rabbi. Hehelped to get me a good place to work inside the camp. A bit laterI was chosen to work in a place of food distribution where I receivedenough food for myself and helped other Jews from the Lomza section.A few girls who came daily for their ration of food received fromme double portions. I also saved several girls from Lomza whom theGermans wanted for medical experimentations.One day I recognized a goi from Yedwabne who helped with theburning of the Jews there. I told this to Hershel, the butcher’s sonfrom Wizno. This goi reported me to the SS that I am seeking to killhim. The SS took me out from the food supply place and sent me tothe camp for punishment. There, they used to select every night peoplewho were forced to hang themselves. At that time I was a memberof the Jewish underground of that camp. My friends of the undergroundwho were already outside of this cursed camp managed to get me outfrom there.After the war I was seeking the mentioned Herschel from Wizno,but couldn’t find him. I have heard that he is in Israel, but up to thepresent time I haven’t succeeded in finding him.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL113the barn. I was standing with my family at the door, for I had thegood luck of being among the last ones forced into the barn. Suddenly,by the force of the flame, the door opened up and when I saw StashekShilaviuk at the other side of the door ready to hit me with the ax,I managed to pull the ax from his hands and managed also to takewith me my sister, her five year old daughter, and Itzchak AaronMendel’s son. The latter’s back was already scorched with woundsthat never healed. He later perished in Aushwitz. I could see my fatherfalling burned to the ground. We ran to the cemetery and lay theretill night fell.In these terrible moments, I noticed that my sister and her littledaughter became totaly gray. In the darkness of the night I took mysister Esther-Lea and daughter Reizale to the priest of the village ofPshitul, and I myself hid at the house of the Doctor Kowaltzuk. Afterthe war I was told that they killed my sister Esther-Lea just twoweeks before the war ended. Someone recognized her as a Jewess.A.bout her daughter Reizale I could never find a trace.At the Doctor’s place I could hide for only a few days. It was notsafe to be there. At night I walked through the fields till I reachedZavad where I worked for a farmer about three months.On one Sunday I heard that the Priest of Zavad had warned hiscongregants to report every Jew they knew of in Zavad to the Germanauthorities. I managed to run away and hide at the barn of the Priest,and in the next night I wandered through the fields till I reached ahouse where there was a small light visible. I entered and found awoman with 4 small children. All of them were hungry. The Germanshad killed her husband because he had shown friendship to theRussians. She permitted me to stay in the house. I took her horseand rode to the forsaken Jewish houses where I found food andclothing. With these I paid for my lodging in her house.When the big snow came down, I received work by cleaning the snow.When I was outside I saw many wagons passing by. I asked wherethey were going and was told, “we are delivering potatoes to theJewish ghetto in Bialystok”. I then decided to go with them figuringthat I may find my sister Nechama there. I had received word thatmy brother-in-law, Chone Berenshtein, the chemical engineer had beenkilled by the Germans. My sister didn’t have children and hadgone to Pruzina. I went to Pruzina and brought her back to Bialystok.Three weeks we were together in Bialystok. Then I was told that myother sister Bluma and her two sons 9 and 4 years old were in the112YEDWABNE600 Jews would be permitted to go wherever they desired. He warnedme that if I’d be asked where we wish to go, we must say: “we wantto go home”. He also warned me not to go to the train station becausethere the Germans were in readiness to shoot any Jew who wouldapproach. I informed all the Jews in the camp of this. All those whodid what I told them remained alive and reached home, including thePecynowitz family.When I came back to Yedwabne I found the Russians in control there.We first thought that under the Russians we would be saved. But toour sorrow, they too arrested many Jews, accusing them of beinganti-communist, and from the remainder, they confiscated all theirpossessions.I started again in my business with a horse and wagon. Shortly beforethe Germans began their war against the Russians, Chaya Piekarz(from the miller’s family) came to me and begged me to take her toBialystok. The Russians did not permit us to carry passengers. ButI took a chance and took this wonderful woman to Bialystok andleft her there with my sister for several days. Chaya Piekarz told methat she had a passport and visa to go to her two sons in the States.She tried to get to Japan and from there to the States. Since that timeI haven’t seen her, nor have I heard from her.When the Germans attacked the Russians in the year 1941, manyJews ran to Russia. I couldn’t do it for I had to care for my agedfather and a sister with a child whose husband was then in Uruguay.I also had to help my brother’s wife and 4 children. My brother wasalso in Urugvay.As soon as the Germans conquered our section, the Polish goyim ofthe surrounding villages began planning with them how to exterminatethe Jews. They drove all the Jews of Yedwabne, among them alsowere Jews from Wizno, and Radzilova, into the market place andleft them in the burning sun without water to drink. They had there1440 people including men, women and children. After mercilessbeatings and many killings on the spot, they drove them into a barnbelonging to Bronek Shlishenski. Standing nearby were the knownJew haters : Jack and Stephan Kozlowski, the blacksmith from Pshes-treler Street near the cemetery, the baker Kurlevski, Aurbach and hisson-in-law, and the entire family of the Osetzkes who lived near thebarn. With joyful songs they poured benzine upon the bam and ignitedit with the Jews packed within.

My mother died in the year 1936.Before the second World War, I was single and took care of my agedparents. Soon after the war, I married my present wife and settledin Australia. We were blessed with two children, a son Shimeon anda daughter Chaya. Our son, now 31 years old, gifted us with a grandsonand our daughter also gave us a grandson. We are thankful to G-dthat after so many years of terrible struggle he has given us muchnachas from our children and grandchildren. My wife was born inChechoslavakia, and she too went through almost the same trials andtribulations as I did. No one of my family in Poland remained aliveand no one knows where they are buried.In 1939, one week after the war began, the Germans started withtheir calculated annihilation of the entire Jewish population of Poland.First they took out all the young men, myself amongst them, anddrove us from village to village until we came to Stalogo, someplacein Prussia. The Pecynowitz family, the millers, including Eli Pecynowitzwere among the three to four thousand Jews that were there.They kept us under the open sky deep in water and mud withoutfood or drinking water. After a few days of terrible suffering aGerman officer came and selected 26 of us for work in the fields.But as soon as he found out that we were Jews, he ordered theguards to beat us mercilessly and left us again without food andwater.A few days later another high officer came and took 40 of us toclean the bams of the horses that the Polish army had left behind.There we received a bit of food that I tried to share with the hungryYedwabner people. When the Polish Goim saw what I was doing withthe food, they took it away from me and beat me up.Then they ordered us to put up shacks for own shelter. We receivedsome food which again I shared with others who were by then almoststarving. We were there between 4 to 5 months.A friendly German told me the secret that Russia and Germany hadalready divided Poland between themselves and that in a few days110YEDWABNEIngeniously, Antonina had spilled gasoline around the area coveringthe bunkers so that the Gestapo’s bloodhounds could not smell theirprey.After the Russians liberated the area, Antonina’s Polish neighborstauneted her for having hidden the seven Jews. She was even beatenup once and she and her husband were forced to leave the farm. (Hehimself had only known about four Jews being hidden — not allseven.)As a token of their gratitude, the Kubrans over the years have ex-tended whatever financial help to Antonina that they could. Theycame to the United States in 1949, staying in New York for threemonths before moving to Hartford and, eventually, to Bloomfield, andthen Simsbury.For the past 22 years the Kubrans have been members of Congrega-tion Tikvoh Chadoshoh which, significantly, was founded in 1941 bythose who escaped Nazi Germany and Austria in time, before theHolocaust, and which has many members who survived the Nazi slau-ghter and came here after the war.★Antonina HonoredTikvoh Chadoshoh’s Mr. and Mrs. Club recently honored Antoninaat one of its major affairs, with Rabbi Hans S. Bodenheimer leadingthe tributes.The modest Polish visitor, embarrassed by the honors paid her, saidshe would like to live here but “I have my family — living and dead —in Poland”. She loved her stay here and remained a month longer thanshe was going to.Commenting on Antonina’s visit, Mrs. Kubran said :“In gratitude for her saving our lives, we wanted to have her comeand visit with us and enjoy life as we do — and she did for fourmonths.“We also wanted to do everything possible to make her happy andwe hope we achieved this goal. She has been like a mother in ourhouse. Hopefully, she will be back in two years when she retires fromwork”.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL109to America in 1949. Having lived for a short time in New York uponour arrival, we then moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where we settledand had a family of three children, all of whom are now married.A ‘Good Will StoryPOLISH WOMAN WHO SAVED THEM WELCOMED BYSIMSBURY COUPLE(Special to the Ledger)Bloomfield — “Good Will’ — the season, the theme — has been verymuch in evidence in recent months at the Kubran home in this town.Jack and Leah Kubran — whose lives would have been snuffed out inthe Holocaust but for the kindness of a Polish woman — have enjoyedhaving her as their guest. Their parting this week was tearful, tem-pered by the fact that they hope she will return from her job as amaintenance worker in a school in Poland.When the Kubrans first tasted the kindness of Anotonina Wyrzykow-ska, it was 1942. The 18-year-olds who had just recently been — mar-ried in the Lomza Ghetto (near Bialystok) fled that ghetto to escape aNazi round-up.Together with five other Jews from two area villages, they found refugein a barn on Antonina’s farm.Selfless WomanFor 28 months this selfless and generous woman protected her charges,giving them bread, water, potatoes as they hid in two bunkers. An-tonina kept her sheep on a floor over the bunkers for further camou-flage.The Kubrans recalled this week how the Germans took away most ofthe farm’s produce. Constanly, the Gestapo poked its guns aroundthe farm looking for the hidden Jews.“We were ready to commit suicide if they discovered us”, the couplesaid.108YEDWABNEWe had no idea where to go, but knew with certainty that we hadto find a place to hide before dawn. Without knowing it, the localfarmers became our protectors, for we crawled without their knowledgeunder the hay piles in their bams and remained there unnoticed bythe Germans and Polaks.We realized we had to find another more safe place. We knew thatSzmulek Waserstein was working at the home of a woman namedAntonina Wyrzykowska in Jancewko while we were in the ghetto. Idecided to go to see if Szmulek was still there and if perhaps thesepeople could be of help to me and my wife. Leaving her hiding ina ditch alone, I traveled during the nights and hid in the woods byday. After several days, I came upon the farm to find that Szmulekwas still there and that Mojsze, his wife and brother Berek had runstraight there from the ghetto.Antonina was known to me, for she had often risked her life bysmuggling as much food as she could into the Lomza ghetto when Iwas there. Now, I was quite happy to see my friends from the ghettothere. They had already built two bunkers in the bam, where theycould hide under the floor of the barn with hay covering them andsheep walking above them. Upon seeing me, Antonina told me tojoin the others, that she would try to do for us what she was tryingto do for the others and that maybe G-d would help us all to getthrough it. My gratitude was overwhelming, and I went to retrievemy wife so that she could join us.It is impossible to express what it meant to us to have a place to stay.During the 28 months in which we were there, Antonina shared manyfrightening moments with us. On one occasion, the Gestapo cameto look for us with dogs and poked around with their bayonnets intothe bunkers, but did not discover us. Our safety had been insured byAntonina, who had poured gasoline around us as soon as she hadnoticed them coming so that the dogs would not detect our presence.Risking her life, the lives of her entire family, and her farm, thisremarkable woman made it possible for the seeming miracle of libera-tion to be one that we could experience.In 1945, after the liberation, we went first to Yedwabne. Our liveswere again in danger from the A.K., who didn’t believe that Jewishholocaust survivors should exist. We went, therefore, to Lomza, andfrom Lomza to Austria.It was while we were in Austria that I had the good fortune of findingan uncle in New York who became our sponsor for our immigrationHISTORY AND MEMORIAL107I came home with this terrible news and told my parents and othersabout it. They thought that I was totally crazy.As it turned out — and regretfully so — I was not crazy after all.The nightmarish rumor became a reality. I was taken away by theGerman military to work for them, while within the town, the liquidationof the Jews went on.From every corner of the town, Polish murderers chased the Jewishpeople into a large barn. One Pole had the pleasure of pushing everyonethrough the doors of the barn to their deaths. They were burnedalive.My ear drums felt like bursting from the pitch of human voicesscreaming and crying in the bam. The smell and smoke of burningflesh was impossible to take. Knowing that my family was amongthem made it even more unbearable.At this time, the Polaks came to the Germans for whom I was workingand demanded that they release us to the fate of the burning bam.The Germans refused, preferring to keep us as laborers, but laterchanged their minds and let us go. We Jews ran in every directionto escape the awaiting Polaks, who succeeded in killing many of us.Luck was with me and I was neither caught nor killed.I ran to Lomza, a ghetto where a cousin of mine lived. There, muchto my joy, was my father, who had run away from the fire. It washere, living with my father also, that I met a girl from Sczuczynnamed Leika Amrofel, who was to become my wife. Living with uswere Mojszo Olszewiez from Yedwabne and his wife Elka Sosnowska,also from Sczuczyn. Mojsze’s brother, Berek Olszewiez, shared thehousehold with us as well.My joy in having found my father was short-lived, for he was soonto be taken away by the black truck-that ominous vehicle which usedto come into the ghetto, catch people, and take them away, never tobe seen again.I was crushed. In this atmosphere of not knowing who would be takennext, life went on. I was taken to work in Zambrow at the “shteinbrook”during the weekdays, and returned home to join my wife and friendsin the ghetto on the weekends.One Sunday in 1942, a great panic broke out in the ghetto. Newscame that the ghetto would be liquidated and that all the Jews willbe sent to concentration camps. I decided that the time had come torun. With my wife and many of the other ghetto Jews, we broke thebarbed wire fence and ran into the night in different directions,106YEDWABNEI went back to Pshitula Street up to the Zaganic, passing the placewhere the wonderful family of the millers lived. The old man Berland his clever wife Reizale had raised, near the mill, two sons and twodaughters. One daughter, Rivke, married Yecheskel Weingerki fromLapi. He too was a miller. The other daughter, Chaicha, married ayoung Chasid from around Wishkow, Avraham Itzchak Piekarz, whowas a great Talmid Chacham and a handsome man. One son, Eliyahu,married a girl, Yente, from Ostrow-Mazowieck. The other son, MosheDavid, married a daughter of the miller in the village of Chludness.We would see them on the Sabbaths and the holidays walking togetherto the synagogue. Elilahu was very close with my Father. Both ofthem were for a long time the leaders of the community. Chaiche hadthree sons, of whom two learned in Yeshivot, became rabbis and heldrabbinical positions in the United States. The third son, Herschel,became a successful businessman in Goniondz and presently also inthe United States. The millers’ home was always the gathering placefor the intellegencia of Yedwabne.I went to visit the Jewish cemetery, hoping to find at least the gravesof my ancestors, and perhaps the ashes of those burned alive on thatday of horror. But the goyim saw to it that there remained not evena sign of their evil deeds. There was nothing left of the 200 year oldcemetery.I left Yedwabne a broken man and returned to Warsaw where I wan-dered about for a few days, and returned to Israel. Here I found com-fort for my shattered spirit when I met with many Indian Jews. Theywere comfortably established in the land for which they had yearnedfor two thousand years. I felt much satisfaction that I had been in-strumental in their returning home.JACK & LEIKA AND THEIR POLISH RESCUERMRS.

All kinds of rumors were spreading throughout the town.It was at this time that a Polish friend of mine came and told me thatin the town of Radzilow, all of the Jews were burned without mercyby the Polaks. I was told that this was precisely what they plannedto do in our town of Yedwabne.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL105from there to Aushwitz where millions of our people were murdered.We saw Block 19, the gallows, the gas chambers, the train stationthrough which millions of Jews went to their deaths. There were moun-tains of shoes, men’s shoes, women’s shoes, and children’s shoes. Andthere were huge piles of women’s hair. The Rabbis lead us in sayingKaddish.Returning to Warsaw, we stopped in Krakow. There we visited theRamo Shul, and the historic Jewish cemetery. In all Krakow therewere only about a dozen Jews. We arrived in Warsaw. I went to thevery old cemetery on Gensha Street, to visit the graves of Y. L. Peretz,Rachel Kaminska, and the grave of my sister Gitel who died in child-birth in 1929.I began planning to visit my home-town Yedwabne. Travelling wasstill dangerous. Many bandits were holding up travellers and Jewswere a favorite target. Since I was a guest of the Government, I waspromised protection and given a car and driver. I was taken throughthe cities of Makow, Ostrolenka and Lomza. Nowhere did I find aJew. However, in Lomza there was one by the name of Greenberg,Before the war he was in the rag business and now he was busy re-deeming properties that belonged to murdered Jews.On the way from Lomza to Yedwabne, I stopped at the village ofYezork, near the forest. There, were buried alive the most intelligentJews of Lomza. We arrived in Yedwabne and stopped in the newmarket place across from Chodnitzki’s. There I was awaited by thechief of police who received word from Warsaw to give me protection.He took me to the house where my parents had lived. I talked withthe people who were living there. They told me all the horrible detailsof the destruction of the entire Jewish community, including myparents, on that fateful day of July 10, 1941.Israel Grondovsky, the carpenter, who converted to Christianity, re-mained alive. He came to see me. He tried to convnice me that he wasstill a good Jew by showing a Jewish calendar. But the stories I heardabout him from the goyim convinced me otherwise. He extorted moneyfrom Jews in America by telling them that he looked after the oldpeople who remained alive. He also told them that the Bet Hamedreshneeded repairing, as did the Jewish cemetery.I went to see the old druggist who was known to be an anti-Semite.He recognized me and started to cry with crocodile tears when he toldme what had happened to my family. “My hands are clean fromblood”, he said.104YEDWABNEthem, but did not kill them. This lasted only two months. Suddenlythere was an order that all Jews were to assemble near the MagistrateBuilding. We knew that something bad was going to happen, andalong with the Pravde family we escaped to the city of Lomza. TheJews there had been into a ghetto where the conditions were very bad.They had no food and no shelter during those cold, frosty days. Withgreat risk to our lives, we managed somehow to get outside of theghetto and purchased some food from the goyim.One week later the Germans made a selection of two thousand Jews,sent them to Gelcziner Forest, and killed them. I was standing bychance in a line of pregnant women, and in that way I was saved. Atthat time I lived with a family from Ostrolenko, whose name wasHoltzman. There was a Mother, a son and four daughters.YEDWABNE AFTER THE WAR, APRIL 1958By Hersh Cinowitz, Atty., Bombay, IndiaIt was in 1956, when Gomulka became president of Poland, that thequarter of a million Jews who remained in Poland began to breatheasier. Jews were permitted to emigrate to Israel or any other land.The first Polish Government delegation, with Prime Minister Chiran-kewitz at it’s head, came to India. As head of the Jewish organizations,I was invited to visit with the Prime Minister. Chirankewitz expressedhis pleasure at the fact that a Polish Jew held a prominent positionin India. He encouraged me to visit Poland and to participate in the 15thanniversary of the Ghetto uprising in Warsaw.While I was a guest at President Bet Tzvi’s residence, the PolishEmbassy called to advise me that my invitation to Poland and my Visawere waiting for me. The very next day I left for Poland. I felt de-pressed thinking about the difference in conditions during my visit in1941 and the present. At that time six million Jews, and among themmy family, were still alive. Now I was coming to a destroyed world.Of all my family there were only three survivors, my brother Meyer’sson Avram, my brother Moishe, and myself.On our arrival in Warsaw we were settled in the Hotel Warshawa. OnSaturday I visited the only remaining synagogue, Nozik’s Shul onTwarda Street. I walked through what was once the ghetto area andsaw the monument at Mila 18. I went with our group to Krakow andHISTORY AND MEMORIAL103(nobleman) and we hid under the trees. We could hear from there theterrible cries of a young boy, Joseph Levin, whom the goyim werebeating to death.The Jews were kept in the hot sun from eleven in the morning untilthat evening. They selected forty people at a time and sent them tothe cemetery where they were forced to dig ditches in which they wereburied alive. In the market place the goyim put Lenin’s statue on aboard, and forced the Jews to carry it and sing Bolshevik songs. Theyput a big stone on the head of Rabbi Avigdor Bialystocki and madehim carry it through the market place. The goyim grabbed YudkeNadolnie’s daughter Gitele, cut off her head and played with it as ifit was a ball. Before nightfall, a man by the name of Weshilewski cameand proclaimed the death sentence upon all the Jews by burning themat stake. He further said, “Because you are decent Jews, we there-fore have chosen for you an easy way to die”. They had alreadyprepared cans of benzine and ordered the Jews to move on to thecemetery. The goyim, with guns in their hands, beat and killed rightand left and then after finally overpowering all of them, pushed theJews into Shelansky’s barn which was near the cemetery. They thenpoured benzine onto the barn and ignited it. From where we werehidden, we saw and heard the crying and lamentations of the suffer-ing people before they died.★Michel Korepatfo, the coachman, was a simple man. The goyim wantedto save him and his family because he had saved the life of a Polishpilot who was escaping from the Russians. His wife begged him toaccept the favor and go home, but Mr. Korepatfo answered, “Wherethe Rabbi will go, I will go”. One of his daughters fell to his feet andsaid that she and all his family would go with him. This simple mantruly sanctified G-d’s name.By contrast, there was one Jew whose name was Israel Grondowski.He was a carpenter and a well-known citizen, who during that timeof distress profaned G-d’s name. He and his family ran to the CatholicChurch, fell to the feet of the priest and asked him to convert themto Christianity, thereby saving their lives. This same man turned againsthis own people. About one hundred and twenty-five Jews had beenlucky enough to hide out and escaped being burned alive. The newChristian told the goyim where the hideout was located. However,after that terrible day of horror, the anger of the goyim against ourpeople had subsided. They put the Jews to hard labour and insulted102YEDWABNEBut our friends were afraid. We had no choice but to conceal ourselvesin the fields of tall-standing com. Mrs. Pravde, with one of her childrenand one of mine, went back to Yedwabne to find out what happeningthere. They never returned to the fields. One day we received a messagefrom Mrs. Pravde which was delivered to the home of one of ourgentile friends in the village who had permitted us to sleep one nighton the floor of his house. She asked us to return to the city becauseher conscience troubled her that she was home and we were in thefields. As we were reading the message, a man came and said, “Runaway fast. The bandits are coming after you”. We saw them coming,so we all jumped into the cellar. They took us out at gunpoint, tookaway all of our belongings, pushed the men into a wagon and droveaway. They took them into a nearby forest and ordered the men toturn their backs to them. Mr. Pravde begged them to allow him andmy husband to say Viduy (confession), which they permitted. My hus-band then recognized one of the goyim, fell to his kness and pleaded,“You know me, and you know I am not a Communist. Please do notshed innocent blood. Have mercy for my wife and children”. His wordsmade an impression upon the murderers and they did not kill thembut instead took them to the city.At that time there was a chief magistrate of the city by the name ofKaroliak. He was known as the most dangerous, vicious anti-Semiteand criminal. He organized all of the criminals and anti-Semites, in-cluding the father and son Kuzenietzki, the infamous brothers Yer-danski, and other bandits. They asked the German authorities for per-mission to kill all of the Jews of the city and the surrounding areas.The Germans permitted them to kill only the Communists. At thattime all the Jews were considered Communists, except the craftsmen,whom the Germans needed for their workshops.On July 10, 1941 (the 15th day of Tamuz), the Jews of Yedwabnewere ordered to go to the market place with brooms in their hands.Men, Women, children, old and sick were chased out of their homesand driven like cattle to the gathering place. My husband took ourtwo children and went there. I stayed at home for awhile trying to putthings in order and lock the windows and doors properly. Mr. Pravdewas in his dye shop dyeing trousers for a German officer, thinkingthat this might save him. Suddenly Mrs. Pravde came in and with aloud cry told her husband Hayim Yosel Pravde to escape. She saidit was very bad. I too ran with them to the grounds of the poritzHISTORY AND MEMORIAL101forced the old Rabbi to carry the statue and recite, “We Jews are res-ponsible for the war and want the war to continue”. Then they ordereda burial for the statue on the Jewish cemetery. With guns and knivesin their hands they chased the tired, hungry, thirsty people who werefaint from standing all day in the hot, bright sun, and they beat themsavagely. Some of us succeeded in running to the com fields. Manywere caught and killed on the spot. Those of us in the fields couldhear the Rabbi saying “Vidu” (confession) with the people, and thenwe saw smoke rise, and there came the smell of burning flesh. LaterI was told that they were driven into a big bam near the cemetery,and then they ignited the straw roof and the Jews who were lockedinside were burned alive. The remains were buried near the cemetery.Eight Jews, including the writer of these lines, survived.MRS. RIVKA FOGEL, AN EYEWITNESS, WRITES ABOUT THEDESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE JEWISH COMMUNITY OFYEDWABNEAt the outbreak of the Russian—German war in June, 1941, Yed-wabne had a Jewish community of about two thousand, including ap-proximately six hundred Jews from the city of Wizno that had beendestroyed earlier. On the very first day that the Germans entered thecity of Yedwabne, they murdered the harnessmaker Yakov Katz, thestitcher Eli Krawiecki, the blacksmith Shmuel Weinstein, the business-men Moshe Fishman, Choneh Goldberg and his son.The sisters, the wife of Avraham Kubzanski and the wife of saul Bin-shtein, whose husbands left with the Russians after enduring horriblepunishment at the hands of the Germans, decided to end their ownlives and that of their children. They exchanged the children betweenthemselves and together they jumped into deep water. Gentiles stand-ing nearby pulled them out, but they managed to jump in again andwere drowned.Jews then began to look for ways and means to survive. I, Rivka, andmy husband Yankel Rurz, together with our children Hershelle andLeibele, joined the Pravde family who also had two children, and weall ran to a nearby village five kilometers away from Yedwabne. Wehoped that our friends among the gentiles there would help us to hide.100YEDWABNETHE TOTAL JEWISH POPULATION OF YEDWABNE BURNEDALIVE BY THEIR GENTILE NEIGHBORS ON JULY 10, 1941Written for Yad V’Shem, Jerusalem, by Mr. Kochavof Kiryat Bialystok, IsraelAfter the vicious pogrom against the Jewish population of my home-town Wizno, located twelve kilometers east of Yedwabne, my parentsand I decided to take refuge at the home of my Uncle Moshe DovidPecynowitz, the miller of Yedwabne. In Yedwabne it was still quiet.The Jewish people had to work for the Germans under the worst de-moralizing conditions, but at that time the Germans did not permitthe very eager Gentiles to destroy the Jews. The leaders of the Jewishcommunity collected a large sum of money and delivered it to theCatholic Bishop of Lomza, who promised that he would not permita pogrom in Yedwabne. Yes, the Bishop kept his word for a while.But the Jews placed too much confidence in his promise and refusedto listen to the constant warnings that came from friendly Gentileneighbors. My Uncle and his rich brother Eliyahu did not believe mewhen I told them what had happened in Wizno. “And if it had happened there”, they said, “we here in Yedwabne are safe because theBishop promised to protect us”.One day my Uncle Moshe Dovid had a visitor. His daughter Devorah’sGentile friend came with a warning. “Tomorrow there will be a pogromon the Jews of Yedwabne”, she said, “and they should all run away”My Uncle and his brother did not believe it, but the younger folksfollowed my advice to take refuge in the fields of tall corn. We layhidden there the entire night. Early in the morning we noticed a greatnumber of villagers traveling at great sped toward the city. This wasvery unusual except on a market day. Suddenly we heard windowsbeing broken and the terrible crying of women and children in thecity. I decided then to go back home to Wizno and meet my parentsand family who had already returned there a few days ago. Theywanted to see what had happened to their possessions. I tried to runthrough the road of the cemetery, thinking thereby to avoid contactwith the goyim in the city, but a group of shkotzim caught me andafter beating me mercilessly brought me to the large market place.The entire Jewish community, men, women and children, includingRabbi Avigdor Bialystocki and all the leadership, were gathered there.In the middle of the market place was a statue of Lenin. The goyimHISTORY AND MEMORIAL99Russians broke through Osowiec and moved towards Germany we allgot together in Bialystok (March 1945) and decided to leave the areaand go to Bucharest, Rumania. Our ultimate goal was to make con-nection with the Jewish Brigade of the British Army and, with theirhelp, get to Palestine by ship through the Baltic.We traveled by train and experienced considerable difficulty beforearriving at Klausenberg, Rumania, where the Jewish community furn-ished us food and lodging. We were in Klausenberg on May 5, 1945when the war ended and we attended the parade.From there we went to Turda where we learned that those who earlierhad tried to leave Rumania through the Baltic had been returned bythe patrols. We rerouted and went through Transylvania to Budapest,Hungary, and from there to Gratz, Austria. In the woods near Gratzthe Jewish Brigade of the British Army picked us up and moved usto Italy where we finally felt free. In Italy we were supported byUNRA.I wrote to my brothers several times from Austria and from Italy, butreceived no answer as the regular mail service had not been reestab-lished as yet. I had met several American officers in Italy and sentpost cards and letters through them. One day I was notified that aphone call for me had been received at the main post office in Rome.(An organization had been formed to monitor such calls.) It was re-quested that I phone back as soon as possible. I returned the call andspoke with my brothers. They obtained a United States visa for me.On June 12, 1946 I arrived in New York on the Italian ship Vulcania.My brothers were there to meet me.I joined my older brother in Columbus, Ohio where I have made myhome. I translated my name to Baker as my brothers had done. Afterseveral months I met my present wife Bessie Marks. We have threechildren : Samuel Mark, Harriet Sarah, and Elliot David.For a few years I operated several general merchandise stores andthen began to build homes for sale. For the past thirty years I havebeen involved in land development, apartment building construction,and real estate management.During this period our children have completed much of their formaleducation. Samuel Mark is an attorney, Harriet Sarah has a B.A. andM.S. in Biology (She is married and has four children), and ElliotDavid is a Ph.D. in Physics.Herschel Baker, Columbus, Ohio, November 10,197898YEDWABNEthe tide turned and the Russian Army turned westward. When theRussians were retaking the area near Osowiec, I hid in a tree and asthe Russians came to this spot, I jumped down. The Russians heldme as a spy. I told them that I had seen many Germans with heavyammunition not far from there and two officers were sent to checkon the veracity of my statements. The officers didn’t return. The high-ranking Russian officer was a woman ; she apparently believed meand asked the other officers if they wanted to check. They replied thatthey trusted me and took me to Marshal Zacharov’s headquarters, anunderground bunker in the Krankofke Woods. I spent several hourstalking to Marshal Zacharov telling him what had happened to theJewish communities of the area.When I was taken from the general’s bunker I was brought to Rybakinot far from Goniandz. There I spent a few months till the Russiansbroke through the Osowiec fortification and continued into Germany.I instructed the Russians on how to take the fortification which wasa difficult operation and took from July to December.In early 1945 I obtained a bicycle and traveled some 30 miles to Yed-vabne hoping to find surviving Jews. The only one remaining wasIsrael Grondofsky, the carpenter, who had converted. I knocked athis door and a Polish woman opened it. When I asked to see him, sheclosed the door immediately saying, “He doesn’t want to see anyJews”.I met a number of Poles with whom I had been acquainted before thewar; several who were known to have taken part in the annhilationof the Jews. One of them asked me, “Hershek, are you still alive ?’I understood the danger and left through little traveled byways.Superficially Yedwabne didn’t appear to have changed much, but thelively commotion of Jewish business and Jewish life was gone. It wasno longer the happy shtetle of my remembered young years.I revisited Goniandz several times. I went to see the farmer who hadcome to warn me that last night, to learn whatever I could of whathad happened to my family. I was told that in loading the wagons,my son, Avrom Yitschak, had fallen from the wagon and may havebroken a leg. I could learn nothing more. I returned to the remainsof what had been my home. I removed buried bolts of cloth and gavethem to those poles who had helped me, and I gave my house to thebrother of the nun in whose bam I had hidden.During the long siege of Osowiec, the survivors from Trestine, Ye-shinofke, Knyszyn, Tictin and Goniandz found one another. After theHISTORY AND MEMORIAL97driven from their homes and hiding places and shoved onto the wagons.The Germans told them that they were being taken to work at a sitenear Osowiec ; they were taken to the gas chambers of Treblinka. In-cluded were my mother, my wife and my children.I continued hiding in the farms on the outskirts of Goniandz. I hidin the attics and the barns and in the dug-outs meant for storing po-tatoes. I would knock on doors at night and ask for food. I hadknown many of these people and they wanted to help me but theywere afraid that they would be reported and their entire familes couldbe killed for this. The farmers in whose barns I hid did not know ofone another.Once, as I was running through a field of standing com, I saw someonepursuing me with a gun. I lay still and waited till he came close. I man-aged to overpower him and tear the gun from his hands and I escapedinto the woods.Among my hiding places was a barn some distance from the city. Theadjacent house was the home of a Catholic nun, her brother, his wife,and their children. The nun was interested in converting me to Chris-tianity and spent long hours teaching me Christian theology. I listenedand therefore was able to hide there. She provided me with food also.On occasion I hid there without anyone’s knowledge.She had a brother who was opposed to her helping a Jew. Once, whenhe was drunk, he ran out yelling ‘T don’t want any Jews”, (“yaniechtzen Zida”) German soldiers heard him and asked what he wassaying. The nun answered ‘T don’t want any ‘Zita’ wheat”, (“yaniechtzem zito”) The German considered him demented and the in-cident was closed.On another occasion I overheard a visiting cousin tell the family thatthey must get rid of the Jew because the Germans knew of me. I cameout of the attic and disappeared into the dark night. Later that samenight I returned unknown to the family.Once, I noticed the small door to the attic open, and a German soldierwas standing there talking to the nun about buying eggs. I consideredshooting him but he soon left. He didn’t notice me.In time Jews hiding in the area found one another and formed anunderground organization. When they heard of Poles who had re-ported hiding Jews to the Gestapo, they set fire to the homes of theinformers. This became known and the danger of being reported wasdiminished.After the defeat of the Nazi Army at Stalingrad (January 31, 1943)96YEDWABNEordered to step forward and to cut off the beards of the old Jews andthe long hair of the younger men. Many Poles stood watching withsticks and whips in their hands. The Germans commanded the Polesto pick out the Communists who were ordered into a separate row. Themayor and secretary of the City Council asked, “Why pick ? All Jewsare Communists”. The Germans said it was not so.The young Poles rushed forward and eagerly made their selectionsand then proceeded to beat those selected over their heads with clubs.As the Germans left they instructed the Poles to send the remainingJews to forced labor on the roads and to do with the Communists asthey wished. The Poles drove the Communists into the Bet Hamedreshand wanted to burn them there, but the Poles living nearby fearedthat their homes might burn also. Whereupon the Communists weredriven from the Bet Hamedresh. Their hands were tied behind themwith wire and they were prodded into the market place. They werelocked into a cellar and later removed, killed, and buried together ina trench.It was well into 1942 when I was taken to forced labor by the Germansand for some months I was one of a group from Goniandz who workedin the Osowiec area repairing roads that had been damaged in the war.The work consisted of breaking rocks with pickaxes and leveling theroad surface. The area was not far from Goniandz and we spent thenights at home.★One night in November, 1942, at about 3:00 A.M., the Polish farmerwho had been delivering dairy products to our home in the pre-dawnhours, awakened us with his pounding. He told us that the Germanshad ordered the Poles from the surrounding communities to supplyseveral hundred wagons (his included) to be delivered at 7:00 the fol-lowing morning. He suggested that I leave. My family urged me toflee and hide outside the city. I left and hid in a bam near the churchunder a manure heap covered with whatever straw was available.Someone must have seen me enter the bam and informed the Germans.German soldiers came searching and pushed pitchforks into the ma-nure. I felt the metal pass against my body. Miraculously I was spared.Thus began my hiding and runing from one place to another. I over-heard the Poles talking among themselves describing what had hap-• - - » ♦pened to the Jews of Goniandz. The Poles of the surrbuhdihg' villagesdfelivei^^ the^^^ ^veral Hlindifed'-W^gofl^ -tts ordered."^ The* PeWs ^di*eHISTORY AND MEMORIAL95requested an answer. I learned of this in the following manner. Ireceived an order to report to the German High Command. Suchorders had come to be known as preludes to disaster, and I was in adespondent frame of mind as I reported as ordered. The German of-ficer in charge asked me if I had brothers in America. When I an-swered in the affirmative, he showed me the telegram and asked mewhat to reply. I said, “answer that we are all well”. I returned tomy home ; my brothers received the answer.I noted earlier that the synagogue had been burned by the Germansin September, 1939, I, therefore, had a minyon in my home during theHigh Holy Days. (1941) My son Avram Yitschak (Zichrono Livracha)stood outside and watched. On one occasion when the Rabbi andcommunity leaders were conducting services and praying, a passingGerman police officer asked my son, “Is your father at home ?” Heanswered “No” and indicated to us that we should hide.The efforts of the Poles to increase Jewish suffering and pain wererelentless. Their sadism was insatiable. The Germans looked with dis-dain upon the overt bestiality of the Poles. Their attitude was one ofdetachment and the outrages continued. The Germans often said tothe Jewish leaders, “We are a cultured nation. It is not our aim todestory you, we require only that you work for us and those of youwho do not cooperate will be severly punished”. Many Jews believedthis. They continued to hope and did not seek means to save them-selves. One could try to escape or even strike back on occation byhiding in the woods (providing that one remained unobserved by thePoles) or one could run deep into the forests and join the JewishPartisans. It was generally believed, however, that the Germans wouldtire of their murderous conduct towards the Jews ; that they wouldestablish order and curb the bestiality of the Poles.Shortly after the German occupation, the German High Commandissued a forcefully worded order that all Jews in the woods and inthe outlying farm communities return to the shtetle. Those remainingwould be shot on sight and if Poles were caught hiding Jews they andtheir entire families were to be shot. The Jews were driven from theoutlying areas and returned to Goniandz. They were ordered to be inthe marketplace at 10:10 A.M. The Poles enforced the orders anddrove Jews from their homes, their barns and attics. The young Poleszealously sought out Jews from every hiding place. Then, the Germancommanding officer ordered that the women be separated from themen. The men were directed to stand in two rows, The barbers were94YEDWABNEThe Germans quickly asserted their power and while the Polish govern-ment continued to function in such matters as controlling the militia,the Poles were subservient to German authority. Orders originatedwith the German High Command and were often carried out by Polishofficials and police. There followed an endless succession of govern-ment orders and decrees. There were Jews who had to report threetimes a day. Every able bodied man and woman had to report forforced labor daily.During this period I spent a great deal of time in the farm communitieson the perifery of Goniandz, I avoided forced labor and was occupiedwith obtaining and bringing food into the shtetle. I arranged with aPolish farmer that he deliver dairy products and produce to my homein the pre-dawn hours.On July 14, 1941 my mother arrived in Goniandz. She had been runn-ing through the woods and fields from Yedwabne to Goniandz and wasexhausted. She had been en route for three days and had escaped theslaughter which the Poles perpetrated on the Jewish community ofYedwabne. (She was able to escape because she habitually dressed inthe manner of Polish women, spoke Polish without an accent, andcould not be recognized as Jewish.) She related the following: Onthe preceeding day several wagons arrived from the surrounding villages.These were to have been used to take the Jews to concentration campsto work. The Poles, however, decided to kill the Jews right there. ThePoles herded together all the Jews of Yedwabne and some from Wisnehand Radzilovo, a total of about fourteen hundred people. The agedRabbi Avigdor Byalistotsky stood at their head as they were kept inthe marketplace in the heat of the day. The Poles struck and merci-lessly beat whomever they chose. The Jews were ordered to marchalong the road to the cemetery; and the Poles drove them into thebam, locked the doors, poured kerosene over the entire bam andignited it. The Poles stood singing and pounding wooden noisemakersto drown out the piercing cries that emanated from the burning bam —“Sh’ma Yisroel ”.After this my mother remained in Goniandz with me. She could notrecover from what she had seen : the annhilation of the entire Jewishpopulation of Yedwabne by the Poles. Among the martyred were hertwo brothers, Eliyahu and Moshe David, (the “Millers”) and theirentire families.We had received no mail from my brothers since the outbreak of thewar. In 1941 they sent a telegram through the Swiss Red Cross andHISTORY AND MEMORIAL93brothers in the United States. I was among many in this category whowere taken to forced labor (March, 1941).During the period of the Russian occupation, my aunt, Golda, herdaughter Feiga, and her father-in-Law, Reb Yankel, shochet of Wish-kovo stayed with us. Her husband, Shia the shochet, was killed byshrapnel when the Germans attacked Wishkowe. Aunt Golda buriedhim herself near a bridge on the road to the village of Schonke. Shewas unable, however, to cover him properly. Later the Russians sentthem across the border further into Russia. Feige married a man inKnyszyn and both of them were killed by the Germans with the otherJews of Knyszyn.★On June 28, 1941, after midnight, we heard the bombs falling andlearned that the Germans were attacking the Russians. The Jews wereterrified and as the sounds of the bombs came closer, they began toleave the shtetle.The forced labor camps were not from Goniandz ; I ran from the camp,came to Goniandz and then left together with the other Jews of thecommunity. We ran into the woods and hid from the shooting. Therewere Soviet soldiers hiding there as well.As the Russians retreated, the Poles looted the cooperatives of clothing,shoes and food and robbed Jewish homes. A Russian patrol wentthrough the streets and fired at the looters. Several were killed butmost ran off with the looted goods. Doors and windows were broken,household goods and clothing were thrown into the streets. Doors andwindows and anything that could be moved were thrown into thestreets. The old Russian fortification, Osowiec, built during the timeof the Gzars, was aflame. Within a few days all the Russians hadleft the area.Gradually, the Jews returned to what remained of their homes andlocked themselves in.When the Poles saw the German Army approaching, they came togreet the Germans with flowers and cried : “Heil Hitler, our liberator.Down with Communism”. They destroyed the huge grandstand whichthe Russians had built in the marketplace.The Poles proceeded to create their own government: they chose amayor, secretary, and police. They immediately ordered those Jewswho had cooperated with the Russians to be brought to governmentheadquarters where they were severely beaten and released.CNLUuCa^ad: attcc awtu iNaui c^iiau vutcruxi* lc uttQ cxud iwam cum* uiu vttcrcxiQ=fGUDO4-»uvr■X.:srju_r3I\r(S-rv;3vr<sa•j<s-1vJ33t:•/K3vrcvr633-i az«s -<3 33 t:i_» ::is3 -J-I 33 v»3vrj x'Z 3VJ VU t-f- 333 -3-» 3u k:«/U Ia a-t r/3 33 U-» 3vr 31947 ,o>ji!7k viap 1’!? ly’i rn’oen1937 nrm!? ,i’nKi np'inK i!;’npnx> : i>n>n ,!>"t >ibn nAi> 'la ncn aan Jacob Danowsky, mother Rella and children: Henry,(TKIAA’IA) OKOWAT’T •*nBl (’’’KP D’>n) v>ai npail David, Meyer and Rochelle'in Yewabnejown e>n>p ay mojSeated from left: Mali Zelenietz, Rivtche Lubel, Sorke Berlin Meyer Danovsky, wife, son and uncleStanding: Kubzansky - Yedwabne 1938,(n:ii0K"in nnnt>n *nnnn’^jnn ininn - nljn’s '‘i : vn’n ,’pDm“nDpoe; in mbynbnFrom left: Seated: Chaya, Feigale, Rancha and Yehuda Piekarz;Standing: Aaron, Sheeye, Golda, Hershl and YankelDaughter of Ghana Stolarsky daughter of Ghana Leizer, Yehuda, Hershl, Lomza 1931Gronowitz (Perished in Yedwabne, Holocaust)July 1941 Hershl at work in Osoviets underNazi-GermanyHershl after liberation, 1946Honor to the generous donors by the City Goverment Mr. and Mrs. Morris Lasky and M.

I was involved also in selling the merchandise at the fairs(seasonal markets) in the surrounding communities and I was able tohelp my mother. In a short time I became manager of the shop ofLazar Chaim Peltinovitch where I worked, and in 1933, when hemoved the shop from Yedwabne to Goniandz, I went with him. Laterwe became partners and in 1937 I opened my own shop.In 1936 I married the elder of his two daughters, Leebe. We had twosons : Avram Yitschak, named for my father, and Moshe Beryl, aftermy wife’s grandfather.My older brother had been in the United States since 1932 and in 1938my younger brother Yaakov Eliezer joined him. They suggested thatour mother and I and family should come to the United States also.We did not consider it; we perceived no danger. Our economic situa-tion was good and my wife did not wish to leave her parents and hersister. My brothers pleaded with our mother repeatedly, but she wasdeeply attached to us, particularly to her grandchildren, and was un-willing to leave without us. In September, 1939, World War II brokeout and the mail service was interrupted.★Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Germans occupied Yedwabneas well as Goniandz. Their presence brought panic to the Jewish in-habiants of these communities. They robbed Jews of their possessions,and in Goniandz they burned the beautiful historic synagogue. Whenthe synagogua was in flames Jews were not permitted to leave theirhomes.A few weeks later, in accordance with the terms of the Partition ofPoland by Germany and the Soviet Union (September 28, 1939), theRussians advanced and the Germans withdrew. The Russians tookover many parts of Poland including Yedwabne and Goniandz.It was difficult to adjust to the regulations of the Communist regime.However, in a short time the Jewish community organized to providesupplies for daily living. They baked bread and opened cooperativesoperated largely by Jews. Jews were employed in various positionsand institutions. Jewish craftsmen went on doing their work in govern-ment owned shops, rather than in their own shops as before. Earningswere meager but the situation was quiescent. Most able-bodied men,ages 20 to 38, were taken to the Russian Army. I was not in this groupbecause I had been an employer (in my own shop) and because I hadHISTORY AND MEMORIAL91Jews lived and sing out in a Slichot melody : “Shteit oif, shteit oif,L’avodat Haborei”, Arise, arise to serve the L-rd.On Friday nights before the lighting of the Shabbat candles, the Sha-mosh dressed in his Shabbat “Capote” (coat) would pause at the leftside of each water-well in the new and old market places and call outin a resounding voice ; “Yiden in shul arain”, Jews go to shul.On Thursday the Shamosh again acted as crier. Once the Bath Housewas heated he would call out: “Yiden in bod arain”, Jews go to theBath House.It was in this role the Shamosh remained an integral part of Jewishlife in Yedwabne.Yedwabne like so many other shtetlach, belonged to a time when lifewas simple, yet filled with pious devotion and honesty. Where peoplelacking modern luxuries none the less raised generations of spiritedyouth. But these simple people were to fall victim to a madness.Generations of Jewish life disappeared into puffs of smoke fromchimneys.The Lojewski and Gushatsky families who trace their heritage backinto Yedwabne’s past, remember this small town as a symbol of thecontinuity of the Jewish spirit.WORLD WAR TWO YEARS REMEMBEREDBy Herschel Piekarz BakerI am the second of three brothers born to Chaya Sore and AvromYitschak Piekarz in the Jewish shtetle, Yedwabne.

May G-d avenge theirblood !MEMORIALDuring my tour of Poland in the spring of 1967, I visited Yedwabne.I was shocked when I found not a trace of that thriving Jewish com-munity that once existed there. The Jewish cemetery was plowed under.The land owned by my family of millers, which they tilled, seededand planted, weeded and watched over, to the fulfillment of a plentifulharvest of potatoes, and some wheat, corn and beans, lay barren. Theirmill and house, storage buildings, bams, sheds, all were destroyed.On their land, near the road, was a gasoline station.I remember all my family. And this is a memorial to all those whowere murdered at the hands of their Pohsh neighbors and GermanNazis.

The horrible dayof the 15th of Tamuz, 5701, corresponding to July 10th, 1941, mustbe made known to the world. The names of the murdered YedwabneJews must be added to the large list of the thousands of Jewish com-munities that existed before the Holocaust, and have been memo-rialized in books. The descendents of Yedwabne have tarried too long.In other cities, like Kolno, a common grave still exists as a memorialto the holy martyrs. Only in Yedwabne was there not even an indica-tion that a Jewish community ever existed.Yedwabne had famous Rabbis, Chazanim, Shochtim, Melamdim, world-renowned schools, modern teachers, and charity institutions. It was athriving, lively place for and because of our people. Therefore it isfrightful that not a word was mentioned in the newspapers of that timeon the exact occurrences of that dreadful day of the destruction ofthe Yedwabne Jewish community. We can find only small paragraphshere and there. One is written by a woman from the Nilowicki familyof Wizno, who came to Yedwabne for refuge. She, like many othersthought this might be a safe place. A woman of the Finkelstein familyof Radzilows, near Yedwabne, related that after the war was over,she was in Yedwabne and saw goyim occupying former Jewish homes.The children were dressed in clothes that had been worn by Jewishchildren. Through a window of Sorchie’s bakery she saw some Jewsand one was wearing a piece of yellow cloth on his arm. He told herthat he worked in the food storage house in what had been the syna-gogue. He related also that the few remaining Jews suffered greatlybecause of the converted Jew, Israel Grondowski, who told lies aboutthem to the anti-Semitic Polish gangs.The son-in-law of the Shochet and Chasid, Dovid Nishtzonski fromRadzilovo, at that time worked in Yedwabne. His wife and childrenrefused to leave their father and grandfather, the Tzadik, alone inRadzilovo, so they remained with him. The wife wrote a note to herhusband telling him that his being in Yedwabne would be worse thanhers. She then wrote to someone else that only twenty Jews remained inthat city by the end of November, when they too were sent to the ex-termination areas together with those from the Jewish Ghetto ofLomza.A woman by the name of Rivke Kaizer from Wizno escaped from themarket place in Yedwabne.

Answer us, as you answered our forfathers.by Jacob L. BakerBen Rav Avraham Itzchok and Haitcha PiekarzTHE DESTRUCTION OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OFYEDWABNE, POLANDRabbi Julius L. BakerDeaf were the heavens to the screams of agony of our unfortunatebrethern who were tormented and then killed in the most viciousmanner that has no equal. Dulled were the brains and hearts of theGentile neighbors of Yedwabne, when they perpetrated such violenceagainst our loved ones, who were a defenseless minority in their midst,and finally burned them alive.The curse of G-d rests upon the filthy earth of Yedwabne. Nothingremains of its Jewish community. The courtyard of the old syna-gogue is no longer there. The Bet Hamedrash, the house of learningand prayer which was located in the midst of the city and was partlydestroyed after the Jews were murdered, has been totally wiped outby the order of the city government. In its place they built dwellingsthat are now occupied by the murderers of our people. Among theJews of Yedwabne were manufacturers, businessmen, public officials,social workers, and many scholars, both secular and Torah.The Jewish community came into being two to three hundred yearsago, and it ended with the beginning of the destruction of all Jewishpresence in Poland. The Jews of Yedwabne were the first to be burnedalive — because they were Jews. This was the accomplishment of theGentile neighbors, the depraved and the defilers of humanity, withthe permission of the Nazis, the monsters of history.I feel it is my duty to do the Mitzvah of Kibud Av V’Em, honoring86YEDWABNEthen sanctify his name ?” His brother answered with extra love;Think — “dearest of my heart”, in the Biblical sentence (Leviticus 22,32—33) ‘7 am the one who took you out of the land of Egypt** (Sifro138 (6) '‘On the condition that you shall sanctify my name**! It wastold that with keen excitement and eager spirits did the two brothers“then” continue their way to carry out the Mitzvah of “KiddushHashem” !These examples brought above, are, a pillar of light and fire bywhich walked and are walking martyrs of all generations includingthis generation of ours. Ours is a generation of furious beauty,masters of higher strength, whose beginning is from those mentionedabove, until this horse and wagon driver and his family and the com-munity of Yedwabne as well as the rest of the martyred Jewish com-munities who burned at stake on Kiddush Hashem.It is fitting to proclaim upon them the sentence (Deuteronomy 5, 23)“FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH, THAT HAD HEARDTHE VOICE OF THE LIVING G-D SPEAKING OUT OF THEMIDST OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE AND LIVED ?”Indeed our martyrs live on in the Yedwabne of above and if we willmerit to be imbued with their life styles, this book will have accom-plished its goal. More than any previous time in our history, we hadto discover to day, what were their secret ingredients that enabledthem to make over 300 years of history — that their Rabbis, leadersand plain people succeeded to overpower all their enemies by raisingbeautiful generations up to this bitter day.We are convinced though to see that at all times our people faced theexact kind of ‘neighbors’ who stood always up to annihilate us, andas then, so now, stood our Jewish Yedwabne in the strength of JewishHeroism.And this was the same power that all the six million of our Martyrssucked from their fathers and forfathers, that stood them by againstall kinds of torture through their acursed oppressors.In this, our Book’s portrayals, we will find how simple people hadlived simple clean lives: that even rough and otherwise bloodthirsty gentiles recognized the nobleness of these simple Jews, and evenhonored them. This was the secret of their existence during this longHISTORY AND MEMORIAL853) In the introduction to the book “Yesod Veshoresh Hoavodo”(Jerusalem 724) Rabbi Shor Yoshuv Cohen relates the following in-cident about its author Rav Alexander Ziskind. When he heard thatthe court was trying to persuade the martyr Reb Eliezer B’rab Shlomoof Rovalov * to convert to Christianity, by informing him that if hewould only convert, his decree of being burnt at stake would be abol-ished. Rav Alexander Ziskind, who feared perhaps the martyr couldn’twithstand this hard and terrible trial, interceded and received per-mission to visit him in the jail. There he impressed upon him, streng-thening his spirit to go through “Kiddush Hashem”. The martyr trulywithstood the test! On the 2nd day of Shovuos of the year 5550was the execution. The multitudes of gentiles of Grodno gathered towatch how this ‘sinful” Jew was being punished, while the Jewish in-habitants of this city hid in their houses for fear of a pogrom. ButAlexander Ziskind left the Synagogue in the middle of the services,put his life in danger to pass through the bloodthirsty gentiles. Helistened to the martyr making the blessing of “Kiddush Hashem”that he had taught him. He answered the Amen, and he returned tothe Synagogue where he made a memorial for the Martyr’s soul.★4) When the 2 brothers Reitzes ; Reb Chayim, bom 1687—1728 andReb Yeshua, 1697—1728 were taken out to be executed in Levovduring Passover of 1728, because of a blood accusation, one brotherasked the other; “why — my darling brother did G-d almighty, mayhis name be blessed, choose this Holy Day of freedom that we shall*3) Reb Eliezer B’reb Shlomo (may his blood be avenged) of Rovalov, on theborder of the Tzarist Russia and Prussia, who dwelled in Grodno. Inwalking, several days before Passover in the year 5.550 ; be noticed agentile woman stumbled and fell into a sand pit. While the Jew madeefforts to drag her out to save her life, she strangled in the sand pit.Gentile passers by who saw the strangled woman and the Jew who stoodat her side, made a false accusation that he killed her intentionally inorder to use her blood for matzo, during the oncoming Passover HolyDay. (in those days such blood-accusations were happenning in the landsof Poland and Lituania). The Jev was jailed and the judgement of terribledeath was decreed upon him, unless he convertes himself to Christianity,then the judgement would have been abolished. NO intercession by theGrodno Jews towards, easing the degree, was accepted.84YEDWABNEAnd so was a soul of a simple Jew inspired by the mighty spirit ofJewish sanctity that spread its inspiration to the rest of his family, sothat they gave the highest price for the sanctification of G-d’s namein holiness and in purity.★In our aim to perpetuate our town in our life time, we shall mark downa few cases of “Kiddush Hashem” in the generations that preceededus, so as to convince ourselves how our town’s martyrs added theirnames into the story of great martyrs and in the tradition of “KiddushHashem” by our people.1) The Ramban (Nachmonidies — 13th century) certified that hewas forced once to be witness at the moment when a Jew was burnedat the stake on “Kiddush Hashem”. He noticed that when the firegrasped the martyr’s body, his face beemed forth with a wonderfullight and a radiance of spiritual joy surrounded him (Sefer “HatorahVehaolam”, Rabbi N. Telushkin).2) When the Gaon of Vilna heard that the Ger Tzedek (righteousconvert) Graff Potocky was being terribly tortured while he was willingand ready to go up on the firebrand for Kiddush Hashem, he greatlywas moved and he sent a message to the “Ger”, encouraging himwith his blessings to be able to adhere to his desision and in the sametime he offered him his readyness to activate his G-d given powersby using the sanctified names, through the secrets of Kabala, to savePotocky from his tortures.However, when those words were given to the mighty young man, hepushed away the thought saying in his Polish language: “niechtzem”(I don’t want), adding “since I recognized the true G-d, I pray that whenthe mitzva of “Kiddush Hashem” shall come to me, I shall fulfill it,and I don’t want to give it up in exchange for saving the body torepeat my duration of life upon earth !” (Rabbi Eli Moshe Bloch inhis book “Ruach Elijah” Lakewood 714 from the mouth of RebAaron Kotler, also in “Chaye Hamusor” Page 274 Bnei Brak Israel724).HISTORY AND MEMORIAL83embers, they were flames of fires. Before embarking upon their perilousjourney, they had visited the memorial tablets of “Yaad Vashem”,and straight from there, they entered the Entebbe hell. There, fromthe very mouth of the lion, from the maniac called Idi Amin, theyrescued almost all 104 people. Their return home was to a jubilantEretz Israel and an astonished, awe stricken world.When Jews are in danger, whether near or far, but as long as it concernsthe Land Eretz Israel, the angels of Eretz Israel come forth to deliversalvation.Our generation stood before this deep mystery. “Thou hast askeda difficult thing”. Who is able to explain that request of those terribleyears ? A request that goes together with the fearful answer “if thouseest me when I am taken from you”. Both the request and answerare links in the chain of “then it shall be so unto you”. In the verydepths of vision “when I am taken from you” the Almighty enli-ghtened us with the “double portion”. This is the spirit that came fromtheir depths and which instilled life into the dying embers to createa life of strength and glory in the land of Israel.★In the pages of the “Memorial Book of Yedwabne” will be foundthe story of Michael Kuropatve the wagon driver of Yedwabne. Hehad jumped into the fire despite the murderers’ offer to spare his life.He had saved the life of a Polish pilot from the hands of the Russiansand as a reward they told him he need not go with the others. Hespat in their faces in disgust as he rejected their offer. He did notwant a life which was “given” to him by these murderers. Instead,he said, “where the Rav goes, there go I”. His wife and his daughterpleaded with him at that moment saying; “perhaps you should listento them and we will be saved”. Michael answered with certainty thatthis is his final decision, to go where the Rav goes, and that they maydo as they choose for themselves. Then the wife and daughter exclaimedkissing and hugging him that they all go together, and quickly, theyran forward and jump)ed amongst those that were to be burnt. Togetherwith the Rav they said VIDUY and the blessing recited upon “KiddushHashem”. The one overriding thought that obsessed them was, aswitnesses later testified — that not even a thought should defile thesanctity of the “sacrifice”.82YEDWABNEa time and while witnessing of wonderful unbelievable triumphs.Again, we were forced into the unprecedented “Miracle of Entebbe”.It appeared as though the devil once again desired to taste the livingflesh of Jews first preserved and then burnt at the stake. Once again hetried to annihilate the Eternal Jews with his hellish torture, much ashe did in Yedwabne under the Nazis.Truly, with the help of G-d, L-rd of the Hosts, our situation is different.“A name bears significance” ! How profound and wonderful are thewords of our sages, when they said “Read not Shomos-destruction,read better “Shemos”-Names. Out of the destruction and desolationthat our enemies wreaked upon us, there and then, the Almightymade “Names”. Significant names, names for our Nation and namesfor our land. The Nation of Israel and the land of Israel, upon whichthe eyes of the Almighty forever watch and protect.★The outstanding might of Israel relative to the land of Israel has alreadybeen alluded to by the Ramban in Genisis 32:2. Angels from EretzIsrael had come to greet him. Jacob had called the place “Machanaim”— “Two-Camps”. It was a meeting place for two hosts of angels. Theangels of the exile that had accompanied him until now, were metby the angels, who would protect him in Eretz Israel.The Ramban asks “And I wonder, for Jacob had not yet reachedEretz Israel, it was yet still distant; he had to cross the ford on theRiver Jabok, which was the border of Ammon and this is to theSouth East of Eretz Israel. He still had to pass through the borders ofAmmon and Moab and after that, the land of Edom. His first approachto the Holy Land was much later, when he arrived at the city ofShechem which is in the land of Canaan. The answer, the Rambansays, is that Jacob beheld this wonderful sigth of angels as soon as hehad come to the borders of his enemies, to tell us that his power wasgreater than theirs IIndeed the Ramban points out to us in his beautiful, meaningfullexpose, that the angels from distant Israel appeared as Jacob approachedthe borders of his enemies. Entebbe is over 2000 miles away fromIsrael, yet when the children of Israel were kept captive there in thehands of their foes, the angels of Israel were there to deliver them.This is the “significance of a Name” instead of “destruction”. Thosedying embers, those burning embers, had verily turned “destruction”into a “name of distinction and significance.” No more were theyHISTORY AND MEMORIAL81INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST(Kings II Cap. 2 V. 9)And Elijah said unto Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for thee, before Ibe taken away from thee”. And Elisha said, “I pray thee, let a doubleportion of the spirit be upon me”. And he said, “thou hast asked adifficult thing, nevertheless, if thou see me when I’m taken from thee,it shall be so unto thee”.From where can we learn that a name bears significance ? Rabbi Elazarsaid from this verse. “Come let us behold the works of G-d who hathmade desolations on the earth (Psalms 46: 9). Do not read “Shomos’(desolations) but read “Shemos” meaning “names” (Brochos 7B).More than 39 years have already passed since the 15th of Tamuz 5701 ;July 10,1941. On that tragic day, 1440 of our brethren, members ofthe Jewish community of Yedwabne and of the nearby communitiesof Radzilova and Vizna, laid down their lives for “Kiddush Hashem”— Sanctification of G-D’s name, as they were burnt alive at the stake.Out of the dark depths of destruction and loss, nevertheless, rays shineforth; rays as bright as the light of the heavens. These Sacred soulsshine forth with a light emanating from the deeper meaning of thesesublime words of Elijah the prophet. Words so profound that theypierce to the very depth of the earth and they go up as they reachtheir way through to the celestial heights of the heavens. Those profoundwords “Indeed thou hast asked a difficult thing” and the answer“If you will behold me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so untothee.”★From the great wonders which the Almighty has done for us in theHoly Land during the last 40 years, we reahze that in this stormyworld, we can survive only if we strengthen ourselves to take a “doubleportion” from the sacred spirit of these mighty warriors, the sacredmartyrs.The burning embers — let us not call them “dying embers” — savedfrom that terrible fire, confounded and confused the whole world morethan once with their great might. Within a short time our enemiesforced upon us five wars through which, with the help of G-d, wecame out victorious. We saw, furthermore, the extension of our bordersand the unification of Jerusalem the Eternal City. All within so short80YEDWABNEBut mother would argue back that I had some chores to do to getready for shul. She always won out and home we marched.As young as I was, I had even then and ever since, an appreciativeeye for feminine beauty. My eye fell on a pretty little girl named Wan-dlowsky, the baker’s daughter. Mama found out about it soon enoughand our relationship came to an end.I remember also our little town being definitely class conscious. Ashuster did not dare associate with the Gabbai or Dozor who werethe elite in the town. The middle class were the shopkeepers, and atthe bottom of the ladder were the toilers; shoemakers, butchers, car-penters, etc. I used to love to watch our neighbor the shoemaker put“shtifter” in the soles of the hand-made shoes. I hope he continueshis work in Heaven, he loved it so much and his finished boots weremost elegant-works of art.As I look back at these colorful characters that made up the town ofYedwabne, I can’t help but to think of each one of them with nostalgiaand affection, as I hope you do.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL79father Shmuel was a pupil of Rabbi Diskin who founded and taughtin the famous Diskin Yeshiva in Jerusalem. In later years, my Grand-father Shmuel and Grandmother settled in Weisbaden, Germany. Hewas in the hide business. My parents made their living from rentalproperties and gardens. In their old age only my sister Elke was withthem. The sons were on their own. The oldest, Meyer, was a shochetin Bialystok, I was an attorney in Wilno, Israel Chayim was a business-man in Weisbaden, Germany, and Moshe was in the yeshivot of Lomzaand Mir.ESSAYMr. A. Oscar GoelmanI remember Yedwabne as a sleepy little town, a closely knit communityof about five hundred, a well organized society. It had all the branchesthat comprised a well established community; a “Hachnosat Kallah”,“Gmilas Chasodim”, “Chevra Kadisha”, a “Hachnosat Orchim”, a“Chevra Mikveh”, a “Chevra Mishne”, a Bet Mid rash, a shul andseveral chadorim.What Yedwabne lacked was a Yeshivah. We had instead a good publicschool, whose principal was A. Dosaky, A Polish educater. He was a veryelegant, imposing individual, impeccably dressed and of military bear-ing. He was clean shaven with a head of flaming red hair and a pairof magnificently manicured hands. Yitzchok, the son of Jonas theironworks storekeeper, and I were the only two male students fromthe Jewish community attending the school. About six Jewish girlsattended the school, the rest were local gentile boys and girls. A friend-ly school, but what progress it was for our town in those early yearsof the 20th century.You may come to wonder just why a Jewish boy attended a goyisheschool and not cheder ? My father realized that I was not “chederishly”inclined and far from becoming a “Talmid Chochom”, so he decidedI may as well acquire worldly knowledge. Our school hours were from8 am till 4 pm and somtimes later.I remember Fridays during the winter when my beloved mother wouldcome to school to fetch me home, as it was getting too close to “Sha-bbos”. Dosaky would argue with her, telling her that Fayvel the“shamesh” did not yet call out “Shul Arain” so I had a little time.78YEDWABNEGrandfather Yankel died at the age of 88 in the year 1916. The funeralservice was conducted by Yedwabne refugees in Bialistok, Reb Pinchasthe Melamed and Rabbi Moshe Goelman. One day before he diedGrandfather Yankel had pictures taken of himself, which were laterdistributed among kis children and grandchildren.Grandfather Yankel had five daughters and one son, my Father. Hisoldest daughter, Baila, was married to Reb Moshe Zolondz fromPlotzk near Kolno. He was Rabbi of Chevra T’hilim in Yedwabne.In later years he emigrated to the United States of America, andbecame Rabbi of Anshei Yedwanbe Synagogue in New York City. RebMoshe and Baila’s son Mendel and his family left Kolno and settledin Tel Aviv, Israel.Grandfather’s second daughter, Ribche, married an iron and steelbusiness man from Lomza, Reb Meyer Rothchild. Reb Meyer alsowas a Talmudical scholar and was active in the Chovvei-Zion move-ment. This pair had three sons and six daughters who were all givena traditional Jewish education and inculcated with deep love for Zion.Their son Avraham Itzchok came to Israel (then Palestine) in 1920and lived in Nes-Tsiona. In 1936 Ribche and Meyer’s oldest son Yonaand his wife Liba arrived in B’nai Brak, and daughter Tsipora withher child Malka and also daughter Rickel and her children came atthe same time. Nachum, another of the Rothchild sons, settled in thecity of Cincinnati, Ohio U.S.A. He became a very successful business-man, and was of great help to the family in Israel.The third daughter, Tzina, married Rabbi Moshe Goelman fromYedwabne. He had a wine business and was the Rabbi of the ChevraMishnayot. In later years they moved to Chicago. Haya Lea, the fourthdaughter, married Reb Simcha Skotznadek. He too was Rabbi of ChevraMishnayot and a successful businessman. Since they were childless,the marriage ended in a divorce. Haya Lea then married Rabbi IsaacTikochinsky, the Rabbi of Pyondnice who later became Rabbi of MekorChayim in Jerusalem. The youngest daugther, Sarah, married RebYudke Nadolne from Novogrod near Lomza. He studied at the ChofetzChayim Yeshiva in Radin.Grandfather Yankel’s only son, my Father, was also a Talmudicalscholar. He too gave shiurim in Talmud at the Bet Hamedresh. MyMother, Shirke Reizel, was the daughter of Rabbi Shmuel Krasneborsky,a grandson of Yisrael Chayim, the old chazon of Yedwabne. My Grand-HISTORY AND MEMORIAL77My Grandmother Malke used to tell her children and grand childrenthat in the year 1812, when she was a little girl, she remembered themilitary forces of Napoleon marching through Yedwabne on their wayto Moscow. She used to tell many interesting stories about the Frenchsoldiers who stayed in the Jewish homes of Yedwabne. It was fromthis grandmother that the son was known as “Yankel Malke’s”. Myfather, her Grandson, was called “Yosel Yankel-Malke’s”.Her first husband died when he was young and left her with fivesmall sons. Her second husband Reb Nachum, known as Nachumthe Shames, was born in the Suwalki Distict. He was a Talmid Chachamand a worldly man and was recognized by the government as theRabbinical representative of the Jewish community of Yedwabne. Hisbrother was A. B. Goldberg, the famous bibliographer of Paris, whopublished several books funded by the Rothchild family. He was alsoa contributor to the “Hamagid”.Great Grandmother Malke was a business woman. She had sevencapable sons. One was killed in the revolt to free Poland in 1863.The others went to the United States, with the exception of Yankel.One son, Israel Radzik, became one of the organizers of the YedwabnerSociety and helped in the building of a synagogue in New York Citywhich bore his name, “Peer Israel Anshei Yedwabne”. Many Jewsfrom Yedwabne were helped to settle in the United States by theYedwabne Society.My Grandfather Yankel Malka’s was the most capable of all the sons.After the death of his Mother he took over management of the familyaffairs. He also looked after Grandmother Gitel’s estate, inheritedfrom her very wealthy parents who had lived in Chiezva. Includedin the inheritance was a windmill and many acres of land. GrandfatherYankel Malkes’s was one of the leaders of the Jewish community andwas go-between for his people and the government. For over fiftyyears he headed a number of worthwhile organizations, and was Gabaiof the Old Synagogue till 1878. On Sabbaths and holidays he devotedhis entire time to learning Torah.

Now, not one tombstone couldbe seen. Our neighbors, the Poles, had plowed under even the remainsof dead Jews. We returned to Warsaw that evening physically andemotionally broken.The following day we went to the Praga Cemetary near Warsaw. MyFather of blessed memory, was buried there when he died in Warsawduring the Bolshevik-Polish War of 1920—21. There too, we couldfind no sign of a grave.I had been steadfast in my belief in man. Suddenly, my ties were cut.My past was a memory only for me. Wherever I looked for the known,for the familiar, I found only emptiness. To stop the terrible depressionwhich was overcoming me from every direction I had to get out ofPoland as quickly as possible. I needed the comfort of my own peoplearound me to regain my stability.We left Poland for a very brief visit in Copenhagen. The dreary weather,the lack of all we needed for our Jewish souls shortened that stay.On we flew to London, where kindness from friends and sunny weatherhelped us over the weekend. And on Monday we boarded the planefor the United States of America and home.THE HISTORY OF THE CINOWITZ FAMILYHersh Cinowitz, Atty., Bombay, India.The Cinowitz family was one of the oldest families in Yedwabne. Itwas among the first to come when Yedwabne was still a village andbelonged to the “pritzim”, the Yedwabyenskies. Most of the first Jewishfamilies came from the area of Poznian and from Prussia. They wereinvited by the landowners to develop the economy of that sectionby helping increase the production and commerce.Roots of the family Cinowitz stem from the city of Tikocin, knownamong the world Jewry as one of the districts of the “Vaad ArbaArotzot”. It is also possible that the Cinowitz family came to Tikocinfrom the small town “Cinowitz” in Prussia. Further, in the recordsof the Jewish community of Tikocin in the year 1700, we find thatthe settling of Jewish craftsmen in the village of Yedwabne was underthe jurisdiction of Tikocin.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL75All the cities and towns through which we drove had totally destroyedevery trace that might show Jews had lived for hundreds of years amongthe inhabitants, and had also considered themselves as Poles. Every-thing looked very alien to me.From Lomza we drove the 21 kilometers to Yedwabne in about 15minutes. During my youth I walked quite often from Yedwabne toLomza and back. I knew every village and its people. Many Jews ofLomza were murdered in those villages during the Second WorldWar.As we approached the outskirts of Yedwabne, I recognized every build-ing we passed. And I recalled every Jewish family that had lived inthose buildings. And now they were occupied by the Polish murderers.We drove past the house that belonged to the Zelenitz Family, and itbrought back many memories of the happy days when I was a youngboy. On the opposite side had stood the remains of the famous woodenSynagogue (it had burned down before the First World War), and theBet Hamedrash, the Chevra-Tehilim, the Chevrah Bachurim. Andnow we passed an empty lot.We drove through the market place, where the Magistrate still existed.The structures and stores belonging to Jewish merchants were nowoccupied by non-Jews. We turned towards the road to Pshitula.We passed the old water well, the house that belonged toShirke-Reizel Tzinowitz, and her big garden. We drove by anorchard that belonged to the priest, and Shilaviuk’s house in front ofwhich was a waterwell. I recognized Franek Shilaviuk — he ran intothe house. He must have recognized me and feared an encounter. Hewas one of the chief murderers of the Jews of Yedwabne. There werewitnesses to his killing of my Uncles Pecinowitz (the millers) and theirfamilies. May G-d avenge their blood !We arrived at the exact site of our home and the windmill that was inthe rear. Now there was no sign of our buildings. In their place wasa small gas station.We continued to the city of Radzilovo, passing the Zaganik (smallforest), and many familiar villages. Even in this area there was leftno indication whatsoever of the many Jewish families that had livedon its soil. On our return we again passed Yedwabne and drove tothe cemetary. Near this area were burned alive all the Jews of Yed-wabne and many from the cities of Radzilowa and Wizna on thatfateful day of July 10, 1941. For almost two hundred years our an-74YEDWABNEthe spirits of the millions of our people who were murdered or buriedalive in this cursed soil of Poland were calling on every one of ourpeople never to forget our martyred dead and to plead with G-d toavenge their blood.In the morning I attended services at the Nozick Synagogue. I was thetenth to make up the minyon of very old people who live on pensionsreceived from the government. One of them walked about with meand pointed out the exact places where famous Jews had been mur-dered. A place where hundreds of small orphaned children were buriedalive. The exact spot where the Ghetto revolt started, where manyGermans lost their lives when they tried to stop the revolt. — This oldman had been one of the warriors of the Ghetto uprising. He was takento the extermination camp of Treblinka, and was later saved by theRussian Army. — On every “Yohr Tzeit” of the fall of the WarsawGhetto he goes to the site to say Kadish for all the Jews who perishedthere.I returned to the hotel where we breakfasted, then I went to “Orbis”and arranged for a car with driver and English speaking interpreter,since I refused to acknowledge that I knew Polish. Often, during ourstops, the driver tried to get our attention, by writing small notes, butneither my wife nor I reacted to the bait. Nor did I respond when hemade overtures in Polish. I was simply suspicious of everyone in thiscountry and concerned for the safety of my family.We travelled northeast, in the direction of my birthplace, Yedwabne,near the city of Lomza. The highways were paved in three and fourlanes. As we approached the cities of Radzemin, Wishkow, Ostrow-Mazovieck and Ostrolonka, we turned off the highway in order to seewhat was left of them. We drove towards Bialystok to reach the famouscity of Tykocin, known for its great Rabbis and very old Jewish com-munity. Our route took us through Sokola, Lapi and its surroundings.Many of our family lived in those places before they were exterminatedby the Germans and their Polish helpers. There was devastation. Jewishdevastation everywhere.★On our return we stopped in the city of Lomza, where I spent manyyears learning in the famous Talmud Torah and Yeshiva. I walkedthrough the streets with the hope of finding some trace ofJewish existence there. To my sorrow, I found only the distinctivebricks of the beautiful synagogue built into a garage on Dluga Street.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL73posite directions. These streets knew laughter and tears, constant move-ment that waned only at night. And always, people. People enteringdoorways, Gentile people, people leaving doorways, big people, littlepeople, Jewish people, those streets were familiar. But what I now sawwas a shock. Each street comer was dutifully marked with its name andthe name of the cross street. But there were no people, houses, buildings.Only empty flat streets and corner posts.I walked on and reached the famous Nalevki Street that had been thehub of all the bustle. This was where the heroic Jews of Warsaw hadbattled against the might of the Germans. This was where the JewishGhetto had been before it was totally destroyed with many thousandsof Jews buried under the ruins. And on the site of our blessed dead,the Polish government had built, on Nalevki Street and the adjacentareas, a number of red brick apartment houses. In front of them —facing the emptiness of what had once been filled with life — was theGhetto Monument. The Ghetto Monument to remind us of our gloriousFighters of the Ghetto and the innocent Jewish blood that had beenspilt in these streets.I went to see the cemetary at Okopova Street (or Gensha Street). Isearched for the graves of the famouse Roshei Yeshivah of Valozinthe “Netziv” and Rabbi Chayim Soloveitchik. Both died and wereburied in Warsaw on that cemetary. There was enough light to see.But I could not find the graves because the burial places were com-pletely neglected.On a huge open space on Marshalkowska Street was erected a largeplatform. From it, diplomats representing many Communist countrieswere addressing the Polish populace. They were asked to be loyal totheir Communist ideals, that by following those ideals Poland wouldbe secured for the next thousand years and after. — I noticed therewere very few listeners.As I walked that evening, I was shocked to find that there was no vest-ige, no trace that Jews had lived in the city of Warsaw. There wasnothing left of the Old Tlomatzka Synagogue and the Jewish culturalbuildings around it. All the familiar Jewish sections and the businessestablishments were completely wiped out. The only site left was theformer Jewish place of worship the Nozick Synagogue. And there onecould barely find enough Jews for a minyon.The loneliness and sadness that I experienced on that first night inWarsaw, the city that I well remember from the good days, left mevery heartbroken and subject to nightmares for a long time. I felt that72YEDWABNEwant to see once again the town of my birth, Yedwabne. We appliedfor and received from the Polish Consulate in Tel Aviv a visa grantingus a 10-day stay in Poland. On May 2, 1966, we flew to Vienna, andwaited several hours for our flight to my past.As soon as we set foot on the plane, we felt as if we were in Poland.The crew and all passengers, except for our family, were Poles. Wearrived shortly after at Akentze Airport, near Warsaw, and were thelast ones to leave for that city due to inspection and clearence. We weretold at the embassy in Tel Aviv that prior reservations were not nec-essary. Nevertheless, I tried to obtain a hotel room for us by phonewhile we were still at the airport. Both the Bristol and the Yerozali-mska (the only 2 hotels in Warsaw) informed that there were novacancies. We had arrived just at the time that Poland was having itsone thousandth anniversary. The city was filled with foreign guests.Fortunately, we took the advice of the English-speaking taxi driver.He drove us to the Yerozalimska Hotel, where he had an acquaintance,twenty dollars discreetly changed hands, and we were shown into alovely room for which the rate was $50.00 per day.While I was attending to our accomodations, my wife and Haya walkedabout the beautiful lobby. Haya was attracted to an unusually elegantcircular staircase that seemed to float to the upper floor, and she ranto investigate. My wife lost sight of the child, and after looking aboutin vain, called softly, “Chaya, Chaya”, a number of times and receiveda shock to hear a strange male voice calling “Chaytcheh, Chaytcheh”.She looked about and saw a Polish porter beckoning Haya down fromthe staircase, and still calling her name. Fortunately, child and motherwere quickly reunited. However, my wife was much shaken by thesnaring of a Jewish diminutive from the mouth of a Pole.Our luggage was soon brought to our room, we refreshed ourselves,and went to the dining room to feed Haya. Our emotions were toostrong for us to do more than drink some hot tea. But Haya wasdelighted by the sight of an Israeli flag at the table next to ours. Therewere flags of the many nations who were participating in the celebra-tions that were taking place. But only the Israeli brought warmth intoour hearts. After a brief stroll, my wife and child returned to ourroom, and I took off alone.The neighborhood streets were very familiar to me from the days whenI was a young boy and studied in Warsaw. There was the hustle andbustle of busy people, of old, tired and dragging ones ; of children runn-ing and playing games undisturbed by the heavy foot traffic from op-HISTORY AND MEMORIAL 71The news of my visit spread like wildfire all through the community.Yedwabne at that time had a population of 2000 inhabitants. Whenthe Germans came in 1939, all the Jews fled. Very few families wereleft. But with the arrival of the Russians they all returned, and manypeople from all over Poland came to Yedwabne where they felt itwas still possible to earn a living. And so I was fortunate to meet againwith not only my family, bu also with many friends. All too soon itwas time to part.Saturday night I ordered a taxi to take me back to Lomza. There wasa hidden feeling that this was the last time we would see each other.But I was at ease with myself for having made this wish with my verybeloved ones before leaving the country. The way back took me againthrough Bialystok. Once more I was with my brother Meyer and hisfamily. From there, I wandered for several days until I reached Vilna.There I immediately joined a group of young men from Warsaw whowere going on transit through Russia and Japan to the United States.We went as far as Moscow and here we learned that Japan no longerpermitted transit since that country was about to enter the war. Aftera few weeks in Moscow, we finally received transit visas through Te-heran, Iran. From there, I and many others went to India, whichwas then under British rule. I settled in Bombay and became in timethe leader of the Indian and Afghanistan Jewry. There were also Jewswho fled the pogroms in Iraq in 1941. And, not surprisingly I foundmany refugees from Poland. However the majority were native B’naiIsrael who had lived in India for over 2000 years.I was by profession an advocate and practised in the High Court ofIndia. My position there enabled me to help Indian Jews to emigrateto Israel. During my time in India approximately 25,000 Jews madeAliyah.THE PILGRIMAGEBy Rabbi Julius L.

The villagers dispersed peacefuly and the Jews of Yedwabnebegan to breathe a bit easier.MY VISIT TO YEDWABNE, March 1941Hersh Cinowitz, A tty., Bombay, India.In 1941 I was in Vilna which then belonged to Lithuania. The cityat that time was full with refugees from all over Poland. From thiscity they could go to any country outside the war zone. Those whohad visas to the U.S.A. were able to acquire transit visas throughRussia and Japan. I had a U.S. visa. However, I was tom between twoforces — my urgent need to run away from the war zone, and mystrong desire to see my parents before undertaking such a long journey.I decided to take the risk, though I knew my chance of leaving thecountry was put in jeopardy, and started on the difficult and dangerousjourney to once more see my parents. I left that the mitzvah of “KibudAv V’Em” was my protection. I went first to Bialystok and visitedwith my brother Meyer and his family for several days and then con-tinued by train to Lomza.One could feel that dark days were approaching. The blackout on thetrain and in the cities we passed depressed me. I arrived in Lomzabegan walking through what were once familiar streets, but were nolonger recognizable. Dluga Street, the old market place and the newmarket place no longer existed. The Synagogue, the Yeshiva and thebeautiful building of the Talmud Torah were wiped off the map ofLomza.I took a taxi to Yedwabne. From afar I saw our house and the gardens.We passed the Sajefka (a small lake), and soon I was in my parent’shome, embraced in the arms of my mother and sister. My father wasthen at the bet-hamedresh. My mother told me that she dreamed thatall her children came to visit them. Unfortunately, I was the only onewho did. I also managed to visit the aged Rabbi Avigdor Bialystocky,who had lost his wife before the war.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL69cause. Since the loss of the head of the family, the “pameisim” hadbeen racking their brains to find ways to accomplish their duty of“Matan B’seyser”. They had planned to secretly trudge and deliverthe Passover case by themselves in such time and manner as therecipient wouldn’t notice, and thus not be able to refuse !SH’MUEL BINSHTEIN (SHIRKE’S) SAVED THE JEWISHCOMMUNITY OF YEDWABNE FROM A POGROM ^By Tzipora RotchildThe city of Yedwabne had its weekly market day on Wednesdays.The farmers of the 52 villages surrounding the city of Yedwabne,came to sell their livestock and produce. In the meantime, they boughtwhat they needed for their farms and households.Manufacturers of clothing, shoes, articles of wood, iron or steel broughttheir products on the market days to sell. Merchants from near andfar came to trade.On one market-day, a certain villager was doing some shopping at aJewish store and left there his billfold containing 100 Rubels that thevillager just received from selling a cow and produce. When the villagerasked the store keeper for the billfold, he denied ever seeing it. Thefarmer, stirred by anger ; called upon his friends amongst the farmersto make a Pogrom against the Jews of Yedwabne, because they arethieves and deserved a good lesson. An air of violence permeated thevillage.Sh’muel Binshtein (Shirke’s) heard what happened, realized the ser-iousness of it and ran quickly to the storekeeper at whose place thefarmer claimed he left his billfold with the 100 Rubels. After someargument with the storekeeper, Sh’muel Shirke’s recovered the billfoldand the money. He brought it to the Magistrate and asked Piontkowskythe Drummer to start drumming at the Marketplace and make thefollowing announcement: “Someone delivered to the Magistrate a1 Before he moved to Yedwabne, he was the Poretz in Pshestrela — duringthe World War he went to Russia and died there.68YEDWABNEHOW YEDWABNE PRACTICED THE MITZVAH OF“MATAN B’SEYSER”(Charity in a concealed manner)We recall the busy preparation for Pessach which started in Yedwabneimmediately after the Purim Holiday. During these 30 days everyonewas busy airing, cleaning, scrubbing, painting, and generally renewingevery particle of the household, to ensure the observance of a realKosher Passover.But the “Parneisim” (elected leaders of the Jewish Community) wereextra busy. They had to cope with the problem of providing thetraditional “Moath Chitim” (Passover expenses for the poor), and,moreover to prevent embarrassment by concealing the giver and thereceiver, so that each did not discover the other’s identity.Here is an episode that occurred in connection with “Moath Chitim”that may shed light on the untiring efforts of the Yedwabner communityleaders to discover new ways to deal with the difficult “Mitzvah”of “Matan B’seyser”.It was about an hour before the Seder of Passover 1922 when thePiekarz family was startled to discover a strange large case standingin the outside foyer of their home. At first glance they thought that itwas surely placed there by mistake. But upon examination of itscontents, they found that it consisted of provisions for a large familyfor use during Passover. The widow, Mrs. Chaitche Piekarz, hadtears in her eyes when she stated : “This time they practiced themitzvah of “Matan B’seyser” on me” ! Would she accept it ? Timebefore the Seder was short.She immediately brought the case of provisions to the attention ofher three sons; Yehuda, then 12, Hershel — 10 and Eliezer 7 yearsold, who were deeply engrossed in the final preparations for conductingtheir first fatherless Seder.The three rejoiced in lifting the heavily laden case on their shouldersand with the Passover song of “Dayeinu” (we have sufficient), quicklywalked the distance of about a kilometer to the respectable house ofShirke-Reizel Zinowitz. They asked permission to leave the case there,expressing the hope that its contents would be enjoyed by more needypeople. They then rushed back to their own Seder.As an insight to this moral story, it is necessary to picture the deepconcern by the leaders of the Jewish community for an ordinary familythat had up to that very Passover supported every good communityHISTORY AND MEMORIAL67A yedwabner characteristic is admired in LomzaThe Rebbi, Reb Itzchok of the 7th grade of the famous Lomza TalmudTorah, was well familiar with the admiration that the Yedwabnerstudent, 11 year old Eliezer Piekarz, had for Kopel the shoemakerwhose shop was located on Shul Street.The student admired the Zadik (righteous man) Reb Kopel whoalways rushed to repair his torn and oft times water logged shoes,rather than allow a helper to do the repairing.When Reb Kopel sewed a patch of leather upon an old shoe, heresembled the Biblical Chanoch, who also sewed shoes. His devoutattitude instilled sanctity in his deeds. He repaired and dried theshoes quickly so the student could attend at least the middle of hisGemorroh Shiur. He was fullfilling the dictum: “A Mitzvah thatarrives into your hands, do not let tarry”.One day, the Rebbi informed his student, with joy, the good tidingsthat a transport of new shoes had just arrived from the U.S.A.. Headvised him that he should immediately enter the big hall and selectthe right shoes for himself. The Rebbi, however, was highly astonishedwhen his ever devoted and obedient student declined to respondpositively. All convincing arguments that in this emergency he shouldforego his pride and accept a pair of American donated shoes, weremet by the student with deaf ears.When at a later date the student’s widowed mother visited the Rebbito receive the expected joyous report on her youngest son’s progress,the Rabbi recounted the shoe incident and complained to her thatthe unique moment of stubbomess was incomprehensible to him Thestudent however took pride in the way his mother defended his action.She stated : “Dear Rebbi, you must remember that Yedwabner trudgeonly with shoes of their own” !66YEDWABNEYeshiva Eitz-Chaim in Jerusalem and when he arrived in the UnitedStates he studied at the Yeshiva of New Haven, Connecticut, wherethe famous baal-mussar and speaker Rabbi Levenberg was the RoshHayashiva. Rabbi Weinberg followed the Yeshiva when it moved toCleveland, Ohio. Then he studied at the Yeshiva Rabbi Isaac Elchonenin New York City, under the famous Rosh Hayashiva Rabbi MosheSoloveitchik, from whom he received Smich in 1933.Rabbi Weinberg first served as assistant to Rabbi Hurowitz of theCongregation Agudat Achim in Hartford, and when Rabbi Hurowitzdied, he became the Rabbi. In 1936 he married his wife who wasfrom Hartford and they honeymooned in Eretz-Israel, where his motherRachel was living. When the Rabbi and his wife returned to America,he was offered and accepted the position with the Washington HeightsCongregation in New York City. That synagogue had no mortgageand could offer a salary of fifty dollars a week. Rabbi J. D. Eisenstein,editor of the Encyclopedia Ozar Yisrael was instrumental in RabbiWeinberg’s acceptance of the position on Parshat Noah, 1941.At that time Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik’s yeshiva was in the YoungIsrael Congregation, and had only 30 pupils. Since the WashingtonHeights Congregation had room for many more students, the Yeshivamoved there and Rabbi Weinberg became the principal. In a shorttime the student population increased to 290. The entire area wassettled by Jews from Germany, and under the influence of their spiritualleader. Rabbi Breuer the children were sent to the Washington HeightsSchool. The synagogue then bought a larger place, which had beena conservative congregation. Rabbi Weinberg converted it into anorthodox synagogue and the school in the new premises grew to 700pupils.After thirty-five years with the Washington Heights Congregation,Rabbi Weinberg decided that it was time to retire. He and his wifesettled in Netanya, Israel. He is the rabbi of the Young Men’sCongregation. He also gives shiurim in Talmud for several groups.Rabbi and Mrs. Weinberg have one son who studied in the YeshivaRabbi Isaac Elchonon and received Smicha from the Dean, HaravYoshe Ber Soloveitchik.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL65RABBI IRVING N. WEINBERG’S ROOTSARE FROM YEDWABNERabbi Julius L. BakerRabbi Irving N. Weinberg was for 33 years the Rabbi and principalof the synagogue and school of the Washington Heights Congregationin New York City. His father. Rabbi Avraham Weinberg, lived inYedwabne where six of his children were bom. His first wife gavehim two daughters, and when she died he married her sister and theyhad two sons and two daughters. In 1900 Rabbi Avraham Weinbergand his two oldest daughters, Eva (married name Stoltz, now 90 yearsold, residing in Bloomenfield) and Bessie (married name Shlachter,now 88 years old), emigrated to the United States and settled in WestHartford, Connecticut. Six years later his wife Rachel moved fromYedwabne to Eretz Israel with her four children, Hyman, Noah,Shainke and Chaike. Rabbi Avraham came from the United Statesand joined Rachel in the Mea-Searim quarter of Jerusalem.Their son Noah became a shochet and mohel and practiced in Jem-salem, and later in Hartford, Connecticut. He took a wife from thefamous Hurowitz family in Jerusalem. Her father was the renownedRabbi Shimon Lidder, Dean of Yeshiva Shaarei Tzedek in the OldCity.Their daughter Shainke (born in Yedwabne) married a Yerushalmi,Ben-Zion Gabriolowitz, named after his father who had died beforethe child was born. Ben-Zion the father was a great grandson ofRabbi Haim from Valozin, Dean of the Yeshiva Eitz-Chaim of Valozin.Raizel, the mother-in-law of Shainke, was widowed at the age ofeighteen, shortly before her son’s birth and she never remarried. TheNaturei-Karta were against the marriage of Ben-Zion to Shainke, andas protest broke windows in the young couple’s home. Shainke diedin Beersheva in 1978.Hyman Weinberg was not well and the doctors recommended that helive near the sea. Rabbi Avraham decided for the sake of Hyman’shealth to move the whole family back to Hartford, and among thetravelers were the two youngest children bom in Israel, Yisochor Leiband Irving N.

There was never a shortageof space in a private household. In case there was no extra bed, onewould always bring in a sheaf of straw from his barn, spread it onthe floor and cover it with a clean bed sheet. Upon being so warmlywelcomed to stay over with the family, a guest would sleep and restup better than in the best of hotels.How Rebbi Itzchok's '‘Hachnosos Orchim" Medicine helped thefamous Yedwabner Rebbitzen!“Good morning Rebbitzen”, said Rebbi Itzchok warmly, when heentered the Rov’s house, “How do you feel today ?” “Not so good.I feel quite weak, I don’t know why” replied the always gentle andrighteous Rebbitzen. “Perhaps I should honor you with an ‘Orach’which will cause you to feel better ?” She answered that she hadone orach already. “So perhaps one more will do the trick ?” ...“Yes, Rebbi Itzchok dear”, immediately agreed the Rebbitzen.

Our revered father, who would certainly have provided moneyfor tuition, had already passed away, and Hershel knew well thatsince most of the people in the Shtetel owned cows, each parent wouldprefer to pay the cost of his child’s tuition with milk. But what wouldthe Rebbi do with so much milk... ? The wise Rabbi applied childpsychology and begged Hershel the great favor of providing him witha daily liter of the special milk from our good red cow, as it wouldhelp him personally, and therewith, his class immensley.

Upon walking down the alley hesensed a Jew watering his garden on Shabbat, a serious violation. Toenter the house, speak with the farmer and reprove him wouldperhaps embarrass the man and Rabbi Eliyahu was punctilious whenit came to respecting man. Instead he paced to and fro on the chancethat the Jew might come out, see him and from that understand thatit pained him, and cease to violate the Shabbat.Such was Rabbi Eliyahu all his life. He lived in fear lest he insultor offend someone. Even when he had to explain something to astudent, he would weave between the desks to reach the student, andthen after explaining the ethical matter he would ask forgiveness fromthe student on the chance that he nudged him in passing.After partaking in some joyous occasion, he would ask the host’s for-givness in case he spilled something from his cup and soiled the table-cloth.He was very cautious in the prohibition of taking time away from Torahstudy. Each moment of his time was precious not to mention that ofothers. When his wife, the Rebbetzin who helped support the house-hold by selling chickens in the market died. Rabbi Eliyahu was filledwith worry. His worry was not about his personal situation of lone-liness. Instead, he worried that if the Yeshivah students would par-ticipate in the funeral, it would detract from their learning. What hedid was to arrange for the funeral to take place during the hours bet-ween classes.For twenty-five years Rabbi Eliyahu stayed with the Yeshivah ofLomza in Petach Tikvah. He taught lessons and led ethical discuss-ions. He left after him many students who remember their prominentand virtuous teacher with trembling reverence. In the Summer of 1949,the learned and rightous Rabbi Eliyahu HaCohen DuSchnitzer wasasked to the heavenly school in the seventy-third year of his life.Before his death he told his students : “It pays to be born in order todie if one has the opportunity of the Mitzvah of saying Yehey sh’meyrabo m’vorach I’olam ulolmey olmayoh May His great name be blessedforever and ever) and Boruch hoo. Uvoruch Sh’mo (Blessed is He andblessed is His name).60YEDWABNEknown that the “Chazon Ish” was very cautious in his speech, ap-praising every word he spoke.Rabbi Eliyahu was born in 1876 in the small town of Yedwabne,in the vicinity of Lomza. In his youth, he was edcated in the Yeshivotof Telz, and Slobodka. In Yeshivah he excelled above all, in his gooddeeds, pleasant ways with others and especially in his modesty andcautious tongue.When he matured. Rabbi Eliyahu travelled to Radin to receive guid-ance from the Chofetz Chaim. He went to Radin to learn the art ofunoffensive speech from the Chofetz Chaim. The Chofetz Chaim tookcognizance immediately of the attributes and characteristics of RabbiEliyahu, and showed him signs of esteem. He even accepted him asone of his confidantes.It is told that when Rabbi Eliyahu would come to Radin to visit theChofetz Chaim, the Chofetz Chaim would rise to greet him with greatlove. When Rabbi Yerucham, renowned as one of the grear moralistsof the last century, left the Yeshivah of Radin to go to the Yeshivahof Mir, the Chofetz Chaim asked Rabbi Eliyahu to fill the vacatedposition. Rabbi Eliyahu stayed in the Yeshivah for a short time butresigned afterwards since he set his principles in life, wthout wantingto carry on his shoulders the burden of an official position. Yet, hedidn’t cease his work of expounding the Torah and teaching reverencefor G-d.In the year 1926 when the Yeshivat Lomza in Petach Tikvah, Israel,was founded. Rabbi Eliyahu was sent there to be with the studentsthat came there to study.I remember when I came in 1935 to learn in the Yeshivah. I metface to face with Rabbi Eliyahu. A Jew short in stature, a glowingface, a hearty smile spread across his lips : his whole being proclaim-ing simplicity. At first I didn’t know his position. He wasn’t theHead”, the “Principal”, the“Overseer”, or any such official. Butafter a few weeks, his existance became clear to me. He was a livingexample of spiritual perfection. It was sufficient to look upon him.upon his radiant face, to be a simple, whole Jew Without anysophistry. His coversations with the students were conducted slowly.His words that were said with pleasantness and in way of conversa-tion as one speaks to his neighbor, penetrated the depths of the souland touched the heart. Then I began to understand why the head ofthe Yeshivah in Lomza, the esteemed Rabbi Yechiel Mordechai Gor-don, sent him to Yeshivat Lomza in Petach Tikva.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL592.

We don’t recall a moment that he was ever aggravated by astudent. Mr. Yosky Bromstein, a classmate in that cheder, now inHaifa, Israel, testified to that fact when met at the Yedwabner Me-morial meeting in Tel Aviv on the Yahrtzeit day on the 15th ofTamuz, the summer of 1978.I recall an impressive moment when a distinguished guest came toour cheder from Eretz Israel in the person of Rabbi Ticochinsky fromJerusalem formerly Rav in Pyontnica near Lomza,Since the guest was a close relative to our Rabbi and Rebbitzen SarahNadolnik, we students also felt close to him. He warmly reciprocatedby displaying before us beautiful pictures of Jerusalem, the Westernwall and its then very narrow approaches. We fell in love with every-thing of Eretz Israel, but vowed to see the approaches to the “Kotel”widened, which has been done, thank G-d, in our own days, by theState of Israel.I visited the Rebbi Nadolnik and his lovely family when they werelater settled in Pyontnica. I recall the sweet, beautiful Gitele, andwhenever we reread the record in this book, of what the reshayim ®did to her, a screem comes from the depth of our hearts: O HeavenlyFather Revenge Her Blood.THE REBBI, REB FAIVELE THE MELAMED !There were five Faivelach in Yedwabne.1. Reb Faivele the Melamed. He taught beginners, boys and girls.It was said that his style of teaching was with a “Taitel” ^ and witha “Konchuk” I remember him as being a good “Baal Tephila”1 Talmudic Scholar.2 His son-in-law is the well known Rabbi Dov Levin now in Jerusalem,Israel and their scholarly children who among them are: Rabbi Kookin Ramat-Gan, etc. The following Yedwabner are related to that family :The Goelmans in Jerusalem and B’nai Brak, the well known writer, RebMoshe & Rivka Zinowitz, Tel-Aviv and Mrs. Zippora Rothchild-Fuchsand Malka Katzir, Tel-Aviv.3 Very wicked persons.1 A wooden pointer.2 Whip.3 Conductor of the Synagogue services,HISTORY AND MEMORIAL57and commanded his children to take those cedars with them whenthey leave Egypt ^She would ask; “Since Jacob knew that the earth of Egypt is suitablefor growing cedar trees, why go to the effort and waste of time, at hisold age, first to dig out the seedlings from Eretz Israel, and then tocarry them and replant them in Egypt, if he could have arranged allof this in Egypt proper ?” “The reason for his so doing carries an im-portant message for us,” she said, “since the Tabernacle to be builtin the desert is for the purpose of establishing a resting place for G-d’sShechina, its building material and workmanship must derive solelyfrom our own labour.As we see, independence was the idealogy of life, derived from thedepth of true religious conviction by the miller family of Kovnat, aswell as of Yedwabne. We may thus perceive their secret in the respectwhich they commanded throughout many generations.As a footnote to the millers’ life principal of independence, see “Sforno”Exodus 33. 5—21. He elaborates upon the theme that the Tabernacle,which was designed for limited duration, as compared to the 1-stand 2nd Temples, exists forever in “Geniza” complete, not even afragment having fallen into enemy hands, according to our sages. Incontrast, the Sanctuary built by King Solomon as well as the secondbuilt by Ezra and Nehemia were burned to ashes. The “Sforno” ex-plains it thus : Because the Tabernacle was built solely by the highlyrighteous Bezalel and his helpers the Shechina penetrated every particleof their work, such that no part could fall into enemies’ hands. Butsince the Sanctuary of Solomon was built by laborers of ‘Tzor’ andthe second Sanctuary was actively and financially built by Cyrus, Tzido-nim and Tzorim, they were completely destroyed by the enemies. Seealso Jonathan Ben Uziel Exodus 26, 5—28 ... that the inner bar in themidst of the boards derived from Abraham’s tree.★THE REBBI REB YEHUDA NADOLNIKThe Rebbi, Reb Yehuda Nadolnik was my first Gemoroh melamedand also my melamed in the Books of the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel.Besides being a Talmid Chochom ^ he was a sweet-natured human3 Tanchuma exodus 25.56YEDWABNEto Reizale a small amount of potato peel for her cow, for which sheimmediately reimbursed her with a whole gallon of milk. When Iwondered at the unequal exchange Reizale explained it thus : “Fromthe small amount of potato peel we may deduce how little food thatfamily had for supper.”When she baked the Sabbath loaves she would secure the doors andwindows by closing them tightly and even draping them. She explainedit philosophically : “Should our gentile neighbours be provoked bythe appetizing odors of the fresh baking, just because their holidayfalls on a day other than ours ?”It was an impressive scene one day during the Bolshevik war in 1920,the way Reizale reached out from her open cellar, her head barelyreaching to the doorway, handing over large loaves of corn bread toa long line of hungry neighbors. She had baked a large number ofloaves and preserved them in her cool cellar for just such an emerg-ency. It is self understood how those gentile recipients then valuedReizale’s foresight. Again she explained it this way: “We Jews havebeen gifted with the characteristic of saving for a rainy day since thetime of our forefather Jacob. The Bible tells us, in the time of famineJacob said to his children : “why should you appear to your heigh-bours as though you are satisfied, although you have saved up forsuch a time while they did not ?” ^SHE RAISES SHEEP IN ORDER TO MAKE GENUINE KOSHERTZITZIS ^Reizale tended her special sheep, concerned with the cleanliness oftheir wool.

Like all Jews ofour town they wouldn’t even think of tasting non-kosher meats.One afternoon they sent a coach for me with the plea that I honorthem with a visit and kosher a steer for them. I found the family sowell-read and Jewishly motivated that I was fascinated and curiousto know how they managed alone within a large forest of goyimI noticed first of all that they were all hard and good laborers, a pointwhich is always respected. Furthermore they practiced true Judaismand thereby were a symbol of kindness to all their neighbours. Butmost of all, they were well armed and known for their heroism.How Reizale the wind-miller developed benevolence between Jew andGentileAs with the miller family of the village of Kovnat, so too was theJewish wind-miller of Yedwabne. It was owned by the well knownBeryl and Reizale Pecynowitz, and it was situated on the outskirts ofthe town, which meant it was in a purely gentile neighborhood.One winter nightfall, I observed neighbour Shilava’s ^ little girl deliver1 Gentiles.2 In the testimony of Y.Y. Newmark we find Stashek Shilava a brother ofthat girl to have been the one who held the ax at the door of the fire bamso no Jew could escape. However Y. Yankel was able to pull the ax outof his hand and thereby save some people, perhaps in Reizale’s merits ...of feeding him.54YEDWABNErun while dragging me on the ground to death, I utilized that momentto jump up on the horse and quickly escape, galloping towards myhome town. The Hallerites pursued after me while shooting, but Imade my way to come home healthy in body and spirit, although myhorse had been shot through the ear. The Jewish people greeted mewith hugging and kisses. They wanted to pay me for my heroic ac-complishment, but I told them that such a Mitzvah they may never buyfor money.After the Shovuos Holiday, there arrived to Yedwabne a full bus ofRabbis in order to meet me and to convey their gratitude and blessingsupon me. Then someone disguised made believe that he was the onewho carried through the message, but when he was questioned to givedetails, he immediately admitted and pointed to me as having beenthe true messenger. After a brief exchange of words with me on thedetails of the entrance to the Bishop’s residence, etc., the Zadik ofRadzilova took my hands in his and said the following prayer:“Through fires and waters, through thunders and lightning, nothingshall ever touch you.” There after did all the other Rabbis, one afterthe other bestow their blessings upon me.I believe truly and whole heartedly that in virtue of their blessingsI was saved, first from the flaming bam in Yedwabne, and later throughthe 514 years in the most dangerous concentration camps.Thank G-d I always came through without even a scratch — so shallthe Heavenly Father continue to help me and my family in virute ofthe Righteous People’s Blessings and we shall all live to see the comingof the Messiah who will bring Peace to Israel and to the entire world.Amen !

They pleaded that I undertake to be themessenger. Although I was much afraid, for I understood the seriousdanger that awaited me on the roads, the thought and deep convictionthat I was thereby going to save such great Zadikim (righteous people),and Chasidim (of highest generosity) put me at peace. So I accepted,donned a gentile type hat, borrowed my gentile neighbor’s horse, (myown horse had conspicuous brown coloring) and as an arrow I flewuntil I reached Piontnica. A Hallerite noticed me and tried to restrainme, but I escaped from him and arrived in Lomza.I then saw what the anti-semites do to the Jews. Near the old churchlay dead Reb Yochanan the salami maker, further on ZondovaStreet the vinegar maker lay dead. Near the old market place in thegutter was the candlestick maker’s corpse. I then went to the Rabbinatein order to inform them of my message. Their faces were all coveredwith black shawls for the Hallerites had their beards torn out untilblood ; they all wept. They wondered how I made my way in such aterrible time. But they blessed me that no evil shall come to me andthat I shall carry through my whole message in peace.Since the Lomza streets were then empty of people, I took courageand quickly rode to the Dvoma Street to the residence of the arch-bishop. When I knocked on the door a nun came out and asked mewhat I wanted. I informed her that I had a letter to the Holy Fatherwhich I had to hand over to him personally. Then came out a priestwho requested that I should hand him the letter. I refused, explainingthat I’m forced to hand the letter personally to the arch-bishop for theHallerites were about to shoot many righteous Polish people. He thenallowed me in, where the Archbishop dressed in a purple, gold coveredvestment accepted the letter from me. Immediately after he read theletter he wrote a letter which he quickly sent out with his specialmessenger (all the phones were then cut off). He then bid me farewelland said everything will be all-right. The arch-bishop’s messengerreached the destination 20 minutes before the execution of the 60 peoplewas to take place.I immediately rode back to Yedwabne in order to be home for YomKippur. Until midway, which was the village of Yezurk, I saw noone. But within the village I was held up by a Hallerite, and whilethey were searching for cord to tie me to the horse and then let him52YEDWABNEIN RESPONSE TO OUR REQUEST, TO EXPLAIN A GREATYEDWABNER LEGEND THAT AS A YOUNG BOY, HE SAVED60 PROMINENT JEWS FROM THE GALLOWS, ITZCHOKYANKEL NEUMARK RECORDS HIS OUTSTANDING ANDHEROIC ACTION IN THE YEAR 1920.

General Haller decided to crown his triumphagainst the Germans by celebrating a pogrom against the Jews ofPoland.In Haller’s army were then enrolled the most notorious anti-semites who,unconscionably plundered, beat, and murdered, tore out beards, andthrew Jewish men, women and children from trains.On the eve of Yom Kippur the Hallerites killed a gentile and hidthe body under the house of the Rabbi of Radzilovo, which was situated16 kilometers from Yedwabne. Afterwards they let pigs out from theirstys to uncover the body. They immediately spread a rumor that theRabbi had murdered the man and thus called publicly to take revengefrom the Jews at once — by arresting 10 Rabbis and 50 CommunityLeaders from the towns surrounding Radzilovo and publicly executingthem all. They arrested the following towns’ Rabbis; Radzilovo, Yed-wabne, including Reb Faivele, Stavisk, Grayeevo, Raigrod, Goniondz,etc., together with the laymen, 60 people.The Radzilover Rabbi know personally the arch-bishop of Lomzafor he had previonsly saved the life of the arch-bishop from the Russians.He was the only one who might have an impression on the antisemitesand therefore could save the 60 lives. The problem was, though, howto reach him in a time when all the roads to Lomza were fenced outby Haller’s men.The Radzilover Rabbi wrote a letter to the arch-bishop which wassigned by all the Rabbis.

They arose to go home,but the return was not as happy and cheerful as the arrival to the mill.With nightfall, one already felt the gray week and its worries and an-xieties. They walked with slow steps, close to one another, quietly.They softly sang a little sad song, “Once again Sabbath departs andapproaching are the weekdays”.In the moments of that twilight, painters, artists of renown shouldhave seen Raizele the Miller’s Wife lost in the depths of her thoughtsas she sang the prayer “G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the HolySabbath is leaving us soon”.

Other food was impossible to obtain ona stormy winter night in Yedwabne, while father would be arrivingsoon, and very hungry. Since there was no choice they decided to putthe food on the table to let Moshe Mordechai detect whether somethingwas wrong.They watched their father eat the dish with an extra appetite. Whenfinished, they asked him whether he noticed anything strange in thefood. “No !” he said, “it was very good”. They informed him whathad happened. He stated happily: “Don’t worry children, MoisheMordechai ‘The Poritz’s’ (honored gentleman) stomach may digestblissfully a combination of kasha with naphtha”.50YEDWABNEboth would go to Raizele for her judgment. She was well versed inthe books in Yiddish providing synopses of the portion of the weekand also in the Midrash with that portion from the Tzenah Urenah.On Sabbath afternoons she gathered together a number of women.For those who were unable to communicate with G-d, may His Namebe Blessed, by means of the holy letters of the alphabet, she read thetext and they repeated each phrase, absorbing like hungry neglectedones.Reizele and her husband Berl, who was a learned man inclined to-wards Chassidism, had two sons and two daughters. Beautiful and charm-ing were the Jewish daughters of Yedwabne. But even more lovelywere the miller’s daughters. Their cheeks were the color of ripe redapples, eyes as blue as the heavens and golden curls framed their faces.Every Sabbath after the meal, the wide road which led from Yed-wabne to the mill was filled with teenagers who with their pranks andjoyous Hebrew made the area ring with gleeful delight.This road stretched far and wide between dense produce fields, fromwhich peeked flowers of all colors whose beauty caught every eye.And here also “grew” out the tall windmill with its long, outstretchedwings pointing to the heavens as if in thought or daydream, not movingat all, in deep meditation and gratitude to G-d for His Holy Day of rest,the Sabbath. This is the mystic time when not only man and animalsrest, but also even a windmill, an inanimate object, moves not thebreadth of a finger.Raizele the miller’s wife had all this time been sitting in the shade ofa tree, surrounded by her lady friends and deriving a great deal ofpleasure from her handsome and talented children. Soon she rose toher feet and quickly walked to the house and into the cellar from whichshe returned with jugs full of cold sourmilk and delicious butter-cakeswhich could be eaten without “netilat yadayim”, the washing of hands.And with warm hospitality she served the ladies and her daughter’sstarving and thirsty friends.After the hearty sustenance for the body, the young ones soon devel-oped a burning hunger for spiritual food. Many of them were yeshivastudents who repeated something new which they had heard, or pre-sented an original thought. The young audience, which not so longago was more than a little boisterous, now sat quietly and good-naturedly in a circle on the grass and listened intently. Only when theHISTORY AND MEMORIAL49the reward of walking towards a mitzvah and have no desire to sharethat pleasure with the horse”.Raizele’s love for the land which is now our Israel is impossible todeseribe, She once heard of a group that was making a pilgrimageby foot to the Holy Land and tried to join it. Her devout prayers forShivat-Zion made a deep impression on all who knew her.The prettiest garden in the village was Raizele's. Her chickens andducks, which she hatched herself, were the finest and the biggest andshe treasured them. Whenever she appeared in the yard, the poultrywould come running to greet her excitedly. She would stand in theirmidst, put her hands into her apron pockets and draw them out fullof corn which she distributed generously to her noisy friends. Andthe well-fed little red heifer, with the pretty white spot on its forehead,followed after her, cuddling close like a child, and with her tonguecaressing Raizele's hands and face. Many times Raizele hid a pieceof bread or slices of potato in the apron pocket, and she never failedto find the hidden treat. She quickly sniffed and snuffled and pokedabout with her nose until she touched the goody and in no time at allwas in the heifer’s mouth. And how proud the mistress was.Raizele’s home was open to all comers. Her great love for humanity,Jews or Gentiles, was all-encompassing. She possessed a good heartand a noble soul. Another’s suffering became her suffering, andanother’s Joy her joy. Jealousy and hatred were not part of her nature.A poor wanderer always found in her home a roof over his head anda hearty meal. And even though she was always overworked and har-ried in helping her husband at the mill, she still found time to helpothers according to their needs. The minute she was through with hergardening, with looking after the heifer and the poultry, and preparingthe delicious meals for the family and assuring that all their require-ments were fulfilled, she would, with her quick steps, start off to thevillage. There she brought milk, butter and eggs for the teachers ofher children. And to people in need she gave a treat of her home-madegoodies.On Grandmother Raizele’s fragile shoulders was set the head of aminister. She quickly solved problems which arose in the mill. Shesmoothed out differences between her Gentile neighbors. And further,when there appeared a conflict of opinion between Jew and Gentile,48YEDWABNEMY GRANDMOTHER RAIZELE THE MILLERRabbi Julius L. BakerOne of the most beloved of all women in the village of Yedwabne wasmy Grandmother Reizele, Berl the Miller’s wife, known to those whoheld dear as “Our Raizele”.She was endowed with all the graces. Beautiful, endearing, clever anda great woman of Valor. Whatever she put her hands to, became per-fection. Her hand embroidered tablecloths, her phylactery-bags forbar mitzvah boys, and her tallit-bags for bridegrooms were knownin the whole neighborhood. As for her cooking and baking, the odorsand tastes spoke for themselevs. Young brides-to-be would come toher to learn these arts, and she, a dear soul, was also an outstandingteacher.She herself would spin the fringes (tsitsot) for the four-cornered gar-ment (arba kanfot) and prayer shawls (talitot) that her male childrenand grandchildren wore. This was a lengthy project. For this purposeshe carefully nurtured a lamb, making sure that the wool grew cleanand strong. When it was time for shearing, the lamb quietly permittedthe process, perhaps because it listened to Raizele’s voice earnestlyrepeating throughout the process “For the Sake of the Commandmentof Fringes” (Lshem Mitzvot Tsitsit). And, during the washing andthe spinning of the wool, she continued repeating in full awareness ofpurpose, “for the sake of the Commandment of Fringes”. All of thiswas usually accomplished while all were peacefully asleep, and herhusband Berl the Miller had awaknened in the middle of the nightto make the special prayer (tikun chatsot) to redeem our sufferingfrom exile. That was when she spun the wool for the sake of the Com-mandment of Fringes. How does one depict Reizele’s joy when shesaw the fruit of her labor, the fully eight-threaded fringes (kaful-shmoneh tsitsit) each strand was made up of eight threads twistedtogether) worn by her children and grandchildren ?When Raizele’s grandchildren studied in the Lomze Yeshiva, shewalked there and back twice a week, the twenty kilometers, to bring thema special treat, either some pastry, cake or “eingemechts” so theycould study Torah with contentment.

Professor Simon Lopata, who often conversed with mymother has repeatedly urged me to compile all her words because, intheir totality, they were rare coming from one person. I’ve alwaysreplied that I would never forget them and that I would find at sometime the opportunity to write about my mother. The basic reason thatI never forgot was that I would constantly quote her expressions atappropriate times even if I articulated them only to myself. In addi-tion, as a child and adolescent, I used to write long Yiddish letters atfrequent intervals to my grandparents, Zaydeh Avremel and BobbehMindel Brickman in Kolno (Poland), and Zaydeh Hershel and BobbehMaryashe Shaber in Lochovich (U.S.S.R.).

From her I learned to know,appreciate, respect, and love her native shtetl of Yedwabne. To thisday I cherish such feelings. It is still hard for me to reject the view ofthose adults who found it incredible that I was a “higger” (American-born) and not a Yedwabner lantsman.To this day, I can recall relatives and lantsleit pointing at me as say-ing. “Dos iz Hershele Shaber.” This is a strong link to the Yedwabnerhalf of my old world heritageFinal Note:For their continual encouragement and help, I am indebted to mylate brother Murray, sister Zelda, and Aunt Sarah Gursky. RabbiJacob L. Baker has been a constant source of inspiration. I also ac-knowledge the editorial suggestions and typing assistance by my be-loved wife, Sylvia, as well as the help by Mrs. Rae Guttman, mysecretary at Touro College.My brother reminded me not to omit Mother’s quotation. “Vos iz afnlung iz afn tsung” (what is in the lung is on the tongue — no duplicity).This is an apparent variation of a Yiddidh proverb,46YEDWABNEder ponim — zynen tsway mechutonim’ (again hardly translatable, butconveying the image of close relationship of the face with anotherpart of the anatomy).Numbers, especially nine, had their own significance. Thus, when oneof us was naughty, we would be warned with quiet firmess : “Du vestkrigen nyn mol nyn — in ocher aryn” (nine times nine, dear — rightin the rear). On the wider social scene. Mother would show her disdainfor a fellow-female’s propensity for perpetual prattle by adapting aTalmudic comment: “A froi hot nyn moss raid — zie hot nyn unnyntsik” (a woman has nine measures of talk out of ten, but she has99). And speaking of numbers, when I started learning multipicationin school, mother taught me as she was taught in Yedwabne: 5 times2, 2 times 5 equals 10.Some attention must be given to Mother’s intra-Jewish ethnic aware-ness. At the top of the scale of peoples were those who originated inNorth Poland (Litvish Paylen, or Lithuanian Poland). These “PaylisheLitvakes” were distinguished from the “gebrotene Litvakes” (Lith-uanian Litvaks) by the fact that they did not confound the letters shinand sin in Hebrew and Yiddish. There were exceptions, for examplethe nar and the occasional rogue. The people of Warsaw were “Var-shover ganovim” (Warsaw thieves) until her niece Rochel marriedChaim Shiya (Hyman) Brooks. Toward Galitzianer (Galicia in sou-thern Poland) her attitude was negative at best and abusive at worst —until my brother and sister married into Galitzianer families. Rumaniaand Hungary were neutral areas. Germans were unpopularly identifiedas “Yeckes”. Mother was never able to convince me that she meantwhat she said about the groups toward which she would expressdisdain. The only time I felt she realy expressed true negativeness wastoward the city and Jewish inhabitants of Stavisk, a town a few milesnorthwest of Yedwabne. These were “anshei samach” (people ofSamach, the first letter of Stavisk). “Avu a Stavisker shtayt, dort zolder ort brenen” (where a Stavisker stands, that spot should bum).She modified the expression of the Psalm which is recited on peni-tential and fast days and on High Holy Days : “A1 tashlichaynurStavisk” (Do not abandon us to Stavisk). I never learned what madeher use these expressions. Oddly, my mother was very friendly to twoStavisker families, one of which was very close to us. Finally, withregard to America, she had great respect, and “America, I love you’’was one of the English songs she liked to sing. Whereas she was sus-picious of the deviousness of some immigrants, she would describe aHISTORY AND MEMORIAL45der alter haym,” a young bridegroom had conscientious objectionsabout participating in the traditional wedding ritual. As a modern,enlightened, secularly educated person, he had no desire, in the firstplace, for the entire ceremony. Persuaded by the bride and the twofamilies, he stood under the “chuppeh” (canopy) and grudgingly allowedthe blessings over the wine. When he was supposed to put the ring on thebride’s finger, he refused to recite the binding formula, “You arewedded unto me with this ring in accordance with the law of Mosesand Israel.” There ensued a turmoil. Finally, the friends of the groomconvinced him that it was but a mere statement and that his agnosticismwould by no means be compromised. “Skazhee Boruch haray at,” theyimplored (Pronounce “You are,” Baruch !) in Pohsh-Hebrew phraseo-logy ; that is to say, let’s get it over with. In our home, “SkazheeBoruch haray at” became the standard expression for any routine orcursory action.Another favorite story of my mother’s — and of the children too —was about the Kayser’s (Kaiser’s or perhaps any emperors) wardrobe.A poor man, it seems, only changes his clothes for the Sabbath. Onewho is much better off financially, three times weekly. A rich man,daily. What about the Kayser? “Der Kayser shtayt un tut zich onun tut zich oys” (The Kaiser has so many clothes that he is constantlychanging them).One of my mother’s favorite pastimes was to turn a phrase into arhyme. Thus, when one would tell her “a dank” (thanks), she wouldrespond “droshe geshank” (gift for the bridegroom for his Torah lec-ture prior to the wedding). In translation, it is meaningless, as it pro-bably is in Yiddish, but everyone thought it was funny. When onedropped into a relative’s or neighbor’s home during mealtime, hewould generally be greeted with “kum mit essen” (join us for themeal). My mother’s reply was “kum mit, nor essen nit” (I’ll take aseat, but not to eat). When I concluded a snack with the “boray ne-foshos” blessing and pronounced the last three words “boruch chayho-olomim” (Blessed be He who lives eternally), my mother wouldadd, “a gezunt in dyn ponim” (untranslatable, but meaning may yoube healthy).When pestered by one of the children, or any other relative for thatmatter, my mother would close the conversation with a pet phrase,“fardray zich dein kop, un mich los up” (approximately — none ofyour guff, just let me off). Of one who was overwhelmed by self-awareness of handsomeness or beauty, she would say, “der ocher unThe Brickman Family: Sholom Dovid, Chaya Sara, lev Moshe, Zelda, RachelSeymour and Leonard Levine at Johnson FieldGussie Levine, Civilian Defense 1943Sylvia's daughters, Renee and Cecile Milton and Sylvia Cohen (daughter and son-in-law of Mendel Kadish)m^T M\:i ,N>an inCKI >poaip»>n D’>n 1>Kn Grand Father of the Tish-Family Horav BoruchMeyer Chayim Tishkovsky and daughter Zelda Itzchok Beinstein, Dayan in Radzilovom ^Dr. Ira and Mrs. Cecile Lebenson, daughters Julie Beth and Rachel Lara(grandchildren of Mendel Kadish)Max and Fanny Tishbx-tQ ’’ni >3*110Reb Avigdor and Mrs. Tzapnicky* grandparents of the Kadish, Cohen andMarkowitz familiesReb Yaakov Sender Itirberg and Wife Sarah-LeahMordechai Yaakov Kadish(Father of Mendl Kadish, son-in-law of Reb A.

Mother would say, “Mit syn saychel kenmen foren in Leipzig handlen” (with his intelligence, he can travelto do business at the Leipzig fair). Concerning parents, she wouldsometimes remark, “Der tateh iz getry, di mameh derbye” (the fatheris devoted when the mother is nearby). Immigrants whose practiceof Jewish law in America did not watch their standard in the OldCountry would be characterized as follows : “In der haym, az er hotgehaysen Mendel, hot men gemegt essen fun zyn fendel; in Amerikeh,az men ruft em Max, meg men by em nor essen lox” (in Europe,where he was known by the Jewish name of Mendel, one could eateverything at his home; in America, with the non-Jewish name ofMax, one can eat only smoked salmon).*Yet, she was frequently capable of good will and reverence, e.g, “Zollstleben biz hundert un tsvantsik yor on a potshinkeh, un dan bet menG-t oif veiter” (may you live to be 120 years old without troubles,and then request G-d for an extension); “avu es shteit a bal tshuvehken a bal tfileh nit shteien” (where a repentant stands, a cantor cannot— actually untranslatable, but explainable in several sentences). Andspeaking of untranslatability, I threw up my hands at “riba fish ungelt afn tish” (rib from Polish ryba, a fish). The translation of thewords is easy, but the meaning is elusive. By the way, there is anotherrhyming line to this in Polish, but I had better not quote it.Typical of my mother’s sayings was the proverb, based on her ownexperience, that the patient know more about his malady than thephysician : “Men fregt nit dem rayfe, men fregt dem chayleh.” I haverecently heard a distinguished doctor of medicine say the same thingwith a less direct vocabulary.Notwithstanding the illness from which she suffered perennially, mymother led a life of levity at home and enlivened meetings with relatives,lantsleit, and neighbors. When we children demanded story after story,she would consent with a condition : “Ir vet shveigen ?” (Will you besilent ?). We hurriedly promised. “Vel ich oich shveigen” (then I willalso be silent), was her reply. Whenever I inquired whether I wouldeat bread and thus be required to wash my hands ritually, the followingdialogue inevitably took place: “Mameh, zoll ich vashen ?” “Du bistazoi oich shein” (You are handsome even if unwashed).I must relate a frequently told tale by my mother. It seems that, “in* My father was more severe in his criticism : ‘Fun a malach iz gevoren agalach” (from an angel to a priest).HISTORY AND MEMORIAL43gayt arois” (fools, leave the bathhouse). There followed silence, butone voice, doubtless that of a nar, called out plaintively, “Myn ditkehiz aych a ditkeh” (I also paid my three-kopek piece). But a fool mightat times have the last laugh : “Az a nar varft a shtein in vaser, kenentsen kluge es nit aroisnemen” (when a fool throws a stone into abody of water, ten wise persons cannot retrieve it). When she appliedthe term narele” (little fool) to me, in was mild reproof combinedwith affection.Let me list miscellaneous expressions frequently used by Mother. Whenshe wanted to be especially specific, she would embellish the Biblicalparaphrase: “B’Rochel bitchoh ha-ktaneh — un Laya di groysse”(Rachel, your younger daughter — and Leah the elder), referring toRashi’s famous interpretation of Jacob’s vain effort at ensuring thathe marry Rachel. She would frequently give advice to us youngsters :“Fang zich on mit a besseren fun dir, aider mit an ergeren” (if youmust start an argument with someone, do so with someone who isbetter, not worse, than you are); “az men git gelt, gai nit, men vetdir nit geben — az men git klep, gai tsu un du vest aych krigen”(don’t go where money is distributed, since you won’t get any — butshould you go where blows are administered, you will get your share).We should keep away from anyone who is “off his rocker” : “Ameshuggener varft zich nisht a shteyn in kop, nor yenem” (a madmandoes not throw a stone at his own head, but at someone else’s). Wewere advised not to criticize others when we might be equally vul-nerable : “Az men hot kinder in di viggen, zoll men lozen lyteh tsfriden”(one who has children of his own should not point out the misbehaviorof other person’s offspring). An overabundance of activities evoked,“Ven iz dem dzhad a klog, az er hot tsway yeriden in ayn tog” (anold man mourns when he has two fairs in one day).Critical comments came easily to my mother. A wedding or Bar-Mitzvah meal that offered something less than a “prepared table”she characterized as follows : “Fish un flaysh ayin lo roassa, tish unbenk azay vi holtz” (no one ever saw fish and meat, but tables andbenches were as abundant as wood). No matter how appropriate thetranslation — and I do not claim that mine is by any means the best— the English somehow never quite catches the full flavor of theYiddish expression. My mother’s attitude toward an individual whoranked a notch or two above that of a “nar” was shown in thephraseology: “Mit zyn saychel un myn gelt ken men foren kaynAmerika” (with his intelligence and my money one can sail to America).42YEDWABNEIncidentally, I remember my paternal grandfather as Avremel Zorachs.Only as I got older, did I identify the family name of my mother’sfirst cousin Bryna Rochel as Bermowitz, and that of Chayele, sisterof my Uncle Avrom (Brownstein — husband of my mother’s sisterChanitke), as Bukofsky.One village character comes to mind. Whenever one of us childrentook up too much space, my mother would say, “Er zeshprayt zichois azai vi Motel Chostovsky’s tochter” (he spreads himself as MotelChostovsky’s daughter). We corrected ourselves at once. A variationof this statement was “Er hot zich zeshprayt vi bym taten in vyngorten”(he spreads himself as if he were in his father’s vineyard).I must have heard my mother’s stories and expressions many times.The repetitions, whether to me or to the younger children, were alwayswelcome, never boring.As mentioned previously, my vocabulary then — and now — has beenfull of Central and East European linguistic terms acquired mainlyfrom my mother. To this day, I use the word “Zavyerucha” for blizzard.When my father was about to punish me for a childish prang or misdeedmy mother would exclaim, “nerus go,” which I took to be the Polishfor “Go easy with him.” But my father also had other means of reproof.Whenever my learning zeal lapsed, he threatened to make me anapprentice to Simcha der Shuster, the shoemaker’s trade apparentlybeing the lowest in the social scale. It did not take me long to inferthat “nye gada” exchanged by my parents meant “say nothing.” Oneof the Russian expressions I learned from my mother was “skazenosdyeleno” (no sooner said than done).My mother’s unparalleled sense of humor expressed itself in rhymes,bilingual puns, and stories. It was not necessary for me to search mymemory for the samples that I will cite. Some of the sayings may beYiddish proverbs, while others may be peculiar to Yedwabne. However,I am certain that she was linguistically creative. Within the confinesof the intimate family, her expressions sometimes took on a quality ofearthiness. These, if quoted, will not represent her exact language.To my mother, a fool was at about the bottom rung in the social ladder.He was to be laughed at, but also to be pitied. “Az a nar geit in krom,freien zich di sochrim” (when a fool enters a store, the merchants rejoice).“Er shteit vi a nar oif a chasuneh” (he stands as a fool at a wedding).“Fun a nar hot men tsar” (from a fool we have sorrow). “Zy nit keinnar, vet men fun der nit lachen” (don’t be a fool, and no one willlaugh at you). In the bathhouse, someone yelled, “Naronim fun bodHISTORY AND MEMORIAL41mediately after Purim. These lessons, and others, were necessary,because I was “Velvele mazik” (Destructive Billy) to her and otheradults.My mother’s speech often included Biblical phrases, either in theoriginal or as part of a pun or other expression. Thus, she stressedindustriousness and honesty by saying “yegiah coppi, nisht yegiahchoppi.” The reference is to Jacob’s assertion to Laban that he gainedhis wealth by “the labor of my hands” (Genesis, 31:42). “Yegiahchoppi,” a bilingual pun, can be translated as “the labor of stealing.”When someone distorted a Biblical meaning or the significance ofa Jewish tradition or law, she would remark, “Rashi iz nit meshuggeh ;der VOS lerent em falsh iz meshuggeh” (Rashi, the popular medievalBiblical commentator, is not crazy ; the one who misinterprets himis crazy.”Coming back to my mother’s reminiscences of Yedwabne, I recallbeing deeply touched by her account of how the village escaped apogrom that was planned for the Easter season. I cannot rememberall the details, but the major events cannot be forgotten. As the rumorsof a pogrom grew, word was communicated to the “polkovnik”(colonel) of the Russian army unit near the frontier. The colonel andhis troops came into the shtetl and ordered all the inhabitants toassemble in the center. Aware of the Polish nationalist sentiment ofthe Christians, he told them : “You say nasa Polska (our Poland),then vasa Polska (your Poland); ‘'nasa giira (our mountain), thenvasa gura (your mountain) — but no pogroms !” This may have beenan isolated incident, but it made a lasting impression upon me.Another unforgettable story, but of another sort, concerned the famedDr. Katzenellenbogen of Bialystok, to whom my mother would gofrom time to time. A professed non-believer, he insisted that he adheredonly to the doctrine of “Tchias ha-meisim” (resurrection of the dead).His justification for this seeming contradiction was as follows : a Jewwho eats a full Sabbath meal of “chont” (usually spelled “cholent”)and other dishes, drinks abundant wine and liquor, sleeps for severalhours, and then awakens — that is proof of “Tchias ha-meisim.”I learned many things, in several languages, about the “alter haym,”from my mother. First of all, I became acquainted with the variousvillages of Lomzer guberni and of more distant places, especiallyhealth resorts visited by my mother. Seldom did I learn family namesof Yedwabner lantsleit. These were identified by their parental orgrand parental names, e.g., Beril Lozers or Yankel Leibel Chinkes.40YEDWABNEperial family in the synagogue. A high officer in full Russian armyregalia marched with his staff into the shul and stood at attention. TheRov recited the “Ha-nosen tshua la-mloshim” (He who gives salvationunto kings), after which the military men marched out. Moreover, therewere occasions when the Russians played the “Bozhitsa” imperialanthem in the shul. At no time did anyone jest about the blessing forthe Tsar as in “Fiddler on the Roof”. It was rather difficult for me,before I learned European history, to reconcile this practice with thesinging of revolutionary songs in the shtetl. These evidences of opposi-tion to the Russian regime were in Russian, Polish, Yiddish, andmultilingual combinations. Thus, I learned the words and music of“Oy vay, doloi politsei” (down with the police)”, “Tzar Nikolai”,“Davolno braty” (enough brothers ... to the barricades) and the like.Apart from picking up these songs, I also mastered the Russian namesof the imperial family in chronological order, just as my mother didin the shkole. In this connection, I understood the meaning of “Krena-tsiya” (coronation) and the accompanying “illuminatsiya”. Never didmy mother refer to the Tsar as Nikolai, but always a “Nikolaiki —yemach shmo v’zichro zoll er veren” (may his name and remembrancebe blotted out) *. Russia remained for her “Fonyeh Ganef” (the crookIvan). By way of contrast, she would always mention with the utmostrespect Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary (“Efroyim Yosel”— a term of endearment for a friend of the Jews). Parenthetically,I wish to emphasize that not only did I learn political songs, but alsoRussian, Polish, Yiddish, and German folk songs. I was particularlyfond of the Yiddish opera “Shulamis”, by Abraham Goldfaden. Atone time I must have known all the arias and choruses. My motherheard this opera when travelling troupes came to Yedwabne.Like my father, my mother was a very pious person who was deeplyconcerned about behavior toward G-d and toward human beings. Iseldom heard her mention “G-tt,” except in the prayers. She generallyused the terms “G-ttinyu,” “Der Eibershter,” or “Ha-Shem.” Whenshe feared that she was becoming too critical of someone, she wouldexplain, “Der Eibershter zol mir nit shtrofen far di raid” (G-d shouldnot punish me for my words). What impressed me most was whenshe referred to Him as “Dem vos ich bin nisht vert onzurufen bymnomen” (the One whose name I am unworthy to pronounce). Oneway of bringing home to me the need to avoid scattering of “chometz”(leaven) during the weeks prior to Paisach was to inform me that,“in der heim,” the family cat’s paws were covered with cloth im-HISTORY AND MEMORIAL39shtetele. It was as large, she emphasized, as “Tal u-moter in a klaynsidderl” (a two-word expression, "‘dew and rain in a little-little prayerbook”) — a triple diminutive. I had a clear notion of the geographyof Yedwabne, especially the locations of the “Bod-gass’ (bathhousestreet) and the Tifleh (church). Yedwabne was so narrow that a horse-and-wagon could not make a U-turn, but had to back up. By 1979,Yedwabne had grown considerably.The noted personalities were familiar to me : “Der Rov” (the Rabbi),Feivel der Shammes. (factotum of the synagogue). Tsallel der BekerBaker and others. Among the non-Jews, I was aware of the exist-ence of the “Nachalnik” (Mayor), the “Kshontz” (Catholic priest),and “di Babke fun der Tifleh” (the old woman at the church).Social and communal organization and other activities were commu-nicated to me constantly. I learned about the “cheyder” (elementaryJewish school), the synagogues, of the various occupational specialties{e.g., Chevreh Shuster, Chevreh Shnyder), and other elements of shtetlsociety. The fact that my grandfather. Hershele Shaber, a “baal-agoleh” by occupation, owned a house made my mother eligible toattend the village shkole, where she mastered the basic curriculum.Der Zaydeh Hershel (Grandfather Hershel) was a man of resourceful-ness. When Cossacks entered Yedwabne, he hid the womenfolk andloaded the soldiers with liquor. Moreover, he was a man of practicalhumor, a characteristic he passed on to his children (particularly mymother). When my mother, the muzhinke (youngest child), did notcomprehend the meaning of the proverb, “Er shynt vi a shmit fartog”(he is as radiant as a blacksmith before daybreak), he determined tomake it clear by the audio-visual method. In the wee hours of thenight, he hitched his wagon and took my mother along to a nearbyshtetl. He stopped by a house and rapped sharply on the door. Outcame Reb Yankel der Shmit in anger. He demanded to know whyReb Hershel aroused him. “I merely want to show my daughter howradiant a blacksmith is early in the morning”. My mother never quotedto me what Reb Yankel replied. On the roads near Yedwabne, I sawthe same kind of boat-shaped wagon driven by my Zaideh.I must record another example of Zaideh Hershel’s humor. Once hedemonstrated to my mother that an ordinary Foyer (peasant) knewHebrew. Upon Zaideh’s request to pronounce “kometz tzaddick”,the Pole replied “Tzaw ?” (Polish for what ?).As a youngster, my imagination was stimulated by my mother’s des-cription of the ceremony of the benediction of the Tsar and the im-38YEDWABNEfor some of the data about my parents. My date and place of birthare accurate, but there are some errors : My father (1883—1942) wasborn in Germany, not Russia, and the maiden name of my mother(1884—1956) was Shaber, not Krieger. These errors were doubtlessdue to the faulty memory of Dr. Isador C. Rubin (1883—1958), afamous gynecologist, a second cousin of my father who served thefamily for a time as obstetrician. The Rubin Pregnancy Test was de-vised by him. Earlier in life, he and my father were fellow-studentsin the Lomzer Yeshivah.Upon coming to America, around 1908, my father learned and prac-ticed the trade of “arbeter bei klucks” (tailor of women’s coats). Hecontinued to study in his spare time and tried to inspire me to becomea “Rov” (Orthodox Rabbi). The more modern and “enlightened”members of his family were saying openly that they would like to seeme become a “Rabbiner” or “Rabbai”, that is a Conservative. Neitherside prevailed.My mother received a good traditional Jewish upbringing and waswell versed in the “Korben-Mincheh Sidder”, “Taitsch-Chumesh”“Techineh” and “Tsena Urena”. In addition, she attended secularschool in the shtetl and was at home in Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish,Russian, German, and several other subjects. She was independentin thought, expression, and action, and never suffered fools or roguesgladly. My sister Zeldeh Rochel (Zelda( recalls hearing from an olderrelative that my mother marched along with the Suffragettes in NewYork, I remember her as a “Zogerke” in the synagouge : she readthe sacred prayer books aloud and was always surrounded by at leastsix women who were unable to read. One of her stories was about aZogerke who pronounced “Umalochim yechofezun”, a passage in theHigh Holy day ritual, and from the third row behind her came the re-petition “myn man geit mit zerisene heizen”. It was never clear tome whether she recounted an imaginary incident or a personal ex-perience.The traditional term “Yedwabner Kricher” crawler, could never beapplied to my mother. She was always active and punctual, traits whichmy brother Maisheh (Murray) and my sister shared with me. SinceI was her first-born in the new country, she spent the maximum pos-sible amount of time with me before the arrival of my brother. It wasthen that I learned the fundamental facts of her shtetl, and these werere-inforced by repetition all through her lifetime.I learned that Yedwabne was not exactly a shtetl, but rather a tinyHISTORY AND MEMORIAL37not always clear to me if a lantsman was a cousin or not. In my childishexperience, all of them were good people, whether related or not. Attimes, I would hear the words shifbruder and shifshvester, which tes-tified to the continuing contacts among persons who shared the har-rowing experience of crossing the Atlantic.It was hard for the lantsleit to believe that I was a native of the NewWorld, the first American male in my fanily on both sides. My dailyspeech was Yiddish, with some additions from the Hebrew, Pohsh,German, and Russian vocabulary, derived from my parents. Mother,in particular, was competent in these languages. My English I pickedup in a fragmentary fashion in the street, and my first real knowledgeof the language came when I was enrolled at the age of five in theRabbi Jacob Joseph School.I was born on June 30, 1913, in a tenement house located at 200Eldridge Street, between Rivington and Stanton Streets. The surround-ing segment of New York’s Lower East Side was Rumanian territory.I suppose there was no apartment available that was closer to the re-latives and lantsleit. We did not stay very long in this alien environ-ment.My parents were married in January, 1905, in Yedwabne, LomzerGuberni, in North Russian Poland. This little shtetl was near the Ger-man border. My father, Sholem Dovid, was born in Friedrichsdorf(now Rosogi, Poland) on the German side, but lived at the time inPolish Mishnitz, also in Lomzer Guberni, not far from Yedwabne.*My mother, Chayeh Soreh, was the youngest of six children born toZvi (Hershel) and Maryasheh Shaber : Zelda, Vigdor VelVel, GhanaItke (Chanitke), Chaim Socher, and Beinush. The first product of myparents’ marriage, Yitzchok Zorach, who was named after his great-grandfathers, only lived a year. I was named, if I recall correctly, aftermy mother’s grandfather. Some of our relatives initially ridiculed thenaming of myself after a “shmeiser”, an assistant to a baal-agoleh(horse-and-wagon driver or carter, in traditional English). Apparently,they connected my ancestral past with my occupational future. Myparents, of course, resisted the innuendo. No one mentioned the socialslur a second time after being countered by my mother’s wit.It is a well-known fact that vital records were scarce, if at all in actualexistence, “in der alter haym”, the old country. In the absence of suchrecords and of precise Oral History, I must rely on my birth certificate*In June, 1979,1 visited these and other shtetlach where my family lived.36YEDWABNEand the chief of police.

BrickmanAugust, 1979One of the first words I learned as a beginner in speech during myvery early childhood was lantsleit. The European townspeople whoemigrated to America kept in close touch with each other. Some-time later I was able to distinguish lantsman from lantsfroi. Thesepeople were very important to my parents — and hence to me. It wasHISTORY AND MEMORIAL35Yona convinced Michel Karopatveh not to use his horse and wagonthough no explanations were given.A few weeks later, the priest met Reb Yona in the street and drew asmall piece of paper from the depths of his long black robe andhanded it to his friend. Reb Yona waited till he was alone before read-ing what was in the note. He learned that the priest had helped avoidanother danger. A group of hooligans came to the priest to get hispermission to have a little “fun” with the Jews during the fair. Hesent them to Koslovsky the cafe owner, with instructions that they befed, at the priest’s expense, all they could eat. That they be given nostrong drinks, and that they then be dispatched immediately to wher-ever they came from.One fine day there arrived a state inspector from Bialystok. He hadreceived a complaint that Yona Rothchild had bribed the police. Itseemed that the anti-Semitic Endekes looked upon the honorable chiefof police Bieletsky as a traitor since he permitted no pogrom againstthe Jews. What’s more, he dispatched two policemen to maintain thepeace at night, whereas the former police head had permitted onlyone. Reb Yona proved to the inspector that he had absolutely no tieswith the police. As a matter of fact Reb Yona always managed to haveother people talk with the chief in his stead.One day. Police Chief Bieletsky came to Reb Yona with the news thathe was being transferred to another city, but that he would ratherremain in Yedwabne. On hearing this Reb Yona took action. The gov-ernor was expected, and when he arrived, Reb Yona was one of thefirst visitors. Directly and to the point he asked the official. “Wouldyou want a pogrom against the Jews of Yedwabne, and, heaven for-bid, the slaughter of many innocents ?” The governor immediatelyreplied that he was no anti-semite and would not permit such oc-currences. Reb Yona then informed him that if the police chief Bielet-sky was transferred out of Yedwabne, its Jews would be left at themercy of the anti-semites. The governor agreed that Pohce Chief Bielet-sky remain in Yedwabne.After Purim in 1935, Reb Yona Rothchild decided to leave Yedwabneand make his way to Israel. Harav Reb Avigdor Bialistotsky wishedto influence Reb Yona to remain and pointed out that the Rav’s son-in-law had been to Israel and had returned. However Reb Yona’smany Christian friends advised that he leave and the quicker the better,before it was too late. There were already many accusations beingspread against him because of his close relationship with the priest34YEDWABNEspread the word that Jews committed the crime as revenge for thekilling of Zundl the Shoemaker’s wife. Customarily, Lupiansky’s bodywould have been laid out in the church for three days, when all theGentiles would come to pay respects, which would be followed by alarge funeral procession, and by propaganda against Jews, wouldinevitably lead to a pogrom against the Jews of Yedwabne. The anti-Semitic organization “Endekes”, in which the priest was also a mem-ber, had already prepared the Christians for the pogrom.The Rav Hagaon Reb Avigdor Bialistotsky saw the danger lurkingover the Jewish population of Yedwabne. He sent Kadish the Shamasto Reb Yona Rothchild to arrange that they two meet at a specifiedtime in the priest’s office. Reb Yona arrived in time for the consulta-tion, only to see the Rabbi go alone into the priest’s office, leavingReb Yona standing in the waiting-room. It took only minutes and theRabbi came out looking depressed, pale and completely lost. Thepriest had told the Rabbi that peace depended not on him, but on thepolice.Reb Yona, as a member of the city council, also had close connectionswith the priest and many influential people in the area. He was anironmonger. And in every form of construction there was a greatneed for steel and iron, which, the Christians found, only Reb Yonawas able to supply. The new church was then in construction andcertain types of the metals were difficult to obtain. However, with hisyears of experience in this business, and his numerous contacts withlarge suppliers, Reb Yona was able to satisfy all requirements forthe church, and at very reasonable prices. Therefore Reb Yona mar-shalled his courage and entered the priest’s office. He was told im-mediately, “I know why you are here, but there is nothing I can do.”Reb Yona asked : “Do you want me to be murdered with the iron Iobtained for you ?” “G-d forbid. No !” the priest replied. And hecontinued, “I beg you earnestly not to reveal to a soul what I amabout to do. I will not permit Lupiansky’s body to lie in the church,and without any type of procession he will be immediately intered. Ibeg, Reb Yona, that during the time of the burial, not one Jew appearon the street. Also, during the approaching days of Easter, no Jewsare to be seen. At the cementery, the priest gave a sermon, and withtears in his eyes, begged the Gentiles not to make a pogrom and notto spill innocent blood. And the chief of police, Bieletsky, who was afriend of the Jews, asked of Reb Yona that Michel Karopatveh thedrayman (trucker) be elsewhere during the time of the burial.

And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her,and said. Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. Andshe said. As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handfulof meal in a jar, and a little oil in a cruse : and, behold, I am gatheringtwo sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that wemay eat it ,and die. And Elijah said unto her. Fear not: go and doas thou hast said : but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring itunto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith theLord God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall thecruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon theearth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: andshe, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the jar of mealwasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word ofthe Lord which he spake by Elijah.Mom, as a poor young widow with children, being inspired by theBiblical teachings as a way of life, felt the Zadik’s blessings bestowedupon us.BETWEEN THE TWO WORLD WARSREB YONA ROTHCHILD RELATESReb Yona Rothchild, one of the elderly survivors of the city of Yed-wabne, lives in Bnai Brak, Israel. He recounts some of his experiencesduring the time he was a member in the Yedwabne City Council inthe restless years before the out-break of the Second World War. Heand his wife Liba were both born in Yedwabne. His father, Reb Meirthe Ironmonger, left Lomza about 1878 for Yedwabne where RebYona was born in 1882.Before Passover, in the year 1934, rumors spread through Yedwabnethat there would be a pogrom against the Jews. Zundl the Shoemaker’swife was murdered. Thursday, at the fair in Radzilova, a stray bulletfound its mark on a Gentile called Lupiansky the Potter. Christians32YEDWABNEHow Possession of a Single ''Zloty' (A Polish Coin) Was Sacrificedby a Poor Widow for Charity, Although it was Certain that as a Result,her Household Wouldn't Have Bread for a Whole WeekThere was such a furious snow storn on a winter morning in Yedwabnein 1922 that one could hardly see a living creature moving abouton the main thoroughfare. This would not have restrained the 8 yearold student from plodding his way to “cheder” (Torah school), if notfor the fact that there was no bread whatsoever in the house for himto take along to school.Mom’s only monetary possession was a single zloty, with which it wasplanned that, when the weather were to let up, she would go to townto buy a week’s supply of bread.Suddenly, a knock was heard on the door. To our great surprise, thepatriarchal personality of the Zadik (righteous man) Reb Fishel, themelamed (Torah teacher) of Lomza appeared. Although from headto toe he glistened with ice, his sweet-singing “Gut Morgen” with hislovely smile warmed us up.Mom, although rejoicing with the highly revered guest, felt at a lossin inviting him to a meal where there was no bread to break which alsoprecluded the traditional blessing for washing of the hands. But atthis thought, while her beautiful face reddened, she rushed to the stove,fireing the wood under it, to prepare quickly a “gritz”, a mixture ofhuber-oats, milk and potatoes, which she served hot at the table.Reb Fishel praised that dish as highly as it had been a sumptuousmeal fit for King Solomon in his time. In the place of the other disheswhich would be served at such a meal, Reb Fishel showered beautifulTorah thoughts that rejoiced us all.We felt assured, that G-d hovers over us even in the most miserabletimes of storm and hunger.Mom pleaded with the zadik, Reb Fishel, that he accept her wholezloty for charity.Interestingly enough, after the zadik left, we felt richer and happierto such a degree that we didn’t even notice that there was no breadin the house. We actually lived through the Biblical story of Kings 1Chapter XVII.“And the word of the Lord came unto him (Ehjah), saying. Arise,get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there :behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate ofHISTORY AND MEMORIAL31I am now happy to report in this book, based on the writings of thewell known educator Levinsky of Yedwabne that in 1907 Reb YaakovPerlman was a highly praised G’moro (Talmud) teacher in Levinsky’sadvanced school in Yedwabne.*An Outstanding Characteristic of a Gentle Yedwabner JewIt was said by our sages, that the true depth of a man can be recogni-zed during his last hours.I recall, when as a student of 16, I arrived home for the holidaysfrom the Lomza Yeshiva. I was summoned by the Bikur Cholim Org.of Yedwabne to take my turn to keep watch at the bedside of RebYankel Perlman during the night. Indeed Mr. Perlman, a known scholarand thinker, was honoring his young attendant with valued Torahthoughts as a reward for causing him to be awake a whole night.But, what made the deepest impression on me about this dear andgreat gentleman, was his deep worry, that, “he might leave this worldwith an extra sin”, he said.I asked of him to please tell me what it is that was bothering him ?“Oh my dear,” he explained, “you’re so young and you never saw aperson die, therefore I’m afraid that in case it happens shortly, andyou get frightened, I would be the cause of it. Such a grave sin Iwouldn’t want to take with me to the world to come.”*Reb Yankel Finds a SolutionHe began to describe beautiful stories from the Talmud, Midrash andKabala, about the almost attractive ... passage from this world intothe world to come, to make certain that in case it happened to him Iwouldn’t become frightened.He continued until the morning, when we parted with the blessingsof longevity of days and years.* fact discovered by Rabbi Julius Baker in the Jerusalem Library.* See “Ralbag"’ Kings II Chap. 2, s. 2 “The Reason why prophet Elyohuwas trying to prevent his disciple Elisha to watch his departure to heaven,was to avert frightening him,,30YEDWABNE“Chalaf” in my possession with intent to committ the “crime”. As Iwalked by, they stopped me.I raised my hands fully when they ordered me to do so. They friskedaround all my body but couldn’t find a thing, because they ignoredmy arms. I always carried my 20-inch-blade “Chalaff” in its fine woodenbox set in my coat sleeve.Thanks to the Fact that the Anti-Semites Didnt know our HolidayLaws, Reb Itche the Katzev was Finally HelpedThe Passover Holy Day had already arrived, and we just finished themaariv services in the Yedwabner Beth Hamedrash. Reb MendelNorenberg the shochet, said to me, that I may go home peacefully tocelebrate the Seder, for, he explained with his smile of wisdom ; sincethose anti-semites do not know our holiday laws, that as distinct fromthe Sabbath, we are permitted to prepare food, which includes thenecessary koshering of cattle, they surely must have interrupted theirobservation. So Reb Mendel Z”L himself, without any fear, accom-plished that job.The Outstanding Talents of Reb Yankel Perlman, a Scholarand Human BeingA scribe in one who either writes scrolls of Torah, phylacteries andmezuzoth, or one who makes the “Batim”, the leather housings forthe biblical portions which together form the phylacteries. The latteris a very rare specialty for which I admired Reb Yankel Perlman,having observed him in action.I was 11^ years of age when Mom sent me to the “soifer” (scribe) RebYankel, to observe the preparation of my Tephilin (phylacteries). Iadmired how beautifully he inscribed every letter on the narrow butlong piece of parchment, which would later be rolled and inserted intothe “Batim” that were still in the wooden press.I then discovered that the press also was made by the soifer’s ownhands. Thus 3 separate professions were accounted for in one person.But I was surprised to learn that those last professions were acquiredin his old age, for previously he was the official mailman of the town-ship of Yedwabne, and it is self-understood that he was also the letterwriter in many languages for brides and groom, etc., plus the ‘Feldcher’(para-professional doctor).HISTORY AND MEMORIAL29I looked at the butcher’s pleading face and then on the worried faces ofmy dear mother and grandmother, who were mindful of the approach-ing war, G-d forbid to lose a visa. But yet they were overwhelmed withpity for this fine man who completely forgot his own self while think-ing of everyone else. I reread the ROV’S note while listening to motherand grandmother’s sweet voices ; “Go sonny and do the mitzvah, andG-d will be with you !”When six months thereafter I stood before the American Consulatein Warsaw, and noticed how many young men were being refusedvisas because of the so-called psychological tests in view of the waratmosphere, I valued that Mitzvah.The Consul asked me a question which was highly difficult to answer.He repeated the following three times : What was my excuse in theapplication which won my deferment from the Polish army ?It is self understood that any logical answer like poor health cover up,white lie, etc., would have justified him to refuse me a visa.When he angrily insisted to have my answer at once, I briefly statedthat he should please answer this question by himself.I then felt Reb Avigdor’s words “God will be with you, my son” whenI noticed the Consul satisfied with that answer.How the Police of Yedwabne Stopped Me on the Street Orderingto Raise My Hands: And Just Because I Obeyed, they Couldn'tFind my ‘‘ChalafIn those days of decree against kosher slaughter, I always carried withme a “Chalaf” (the principal koshering knife), to be ready whennecessary to outsmart the secret police, and save people from star-vation.For instance; Reb Itche Atlasowicz, the butcher, bought his animalon Wednesday, the market day, a whole week before Passover andhid her in his home cellar instead of in his regular stable. He was hop-ing that in this way he might avoid the watchdog’s eyes. He forgotthough, first that his house wasn’t very far from his stable, and second,that those secret watchdogs had observed and followed him from themoment he led the cattle from the market, and that they even becameacquainted with that animal’s voice ...On my way to the Beth Hamedrash, I had to pass the house of thatkatzev, Reb Itche Atlasowicz. The detectives who had staked-out theplace around the clock, thought, that they finally caught me with a28YEDWABNEtors would receive 1/2 of the meats confiscated, and the Shochet in-volved would receive a long jail term.The Rov advised the butchers of a plan by which they could outsmartall the anti-semites and supply Jewish Yedwabne with a Happy Pas-sover. One day before the holiday eve, at 3 A.M. the butchers quietlyknocked on my window, through which I jumped into their wagonand swiftly we galloped through the fields and hidden paths to a faraway village.We left a horse and wagon by the house of the poritz (leader of thevillage), and we peacefully walked to the other end of the villagewhere in a large stable were plenty of live-stock waiting to be koshered.Everything was done as planned, correctly and in time. By the sameafternoon all the meat had been already delivered into the homes ofall the Jewish inhabitants of the town. The secret police and theirsubordinates were seen still sweating to put back in order, the poritz’sstalks of hay, stables, and etc. which they had turned over while seek-ing the contraband ... They had been so confident of finding us atthat spot, where a butcher’s horse and wagon was waiting, for its ownerto return. When the butcher came and the police couldn’t find theexpected meat, even in all the butcher stores, they all left, tired withembarrassed faces. Thus the butchers and all Yedwabne Jews enjoyedtheir well deserved revenge against the Hamans.How the Police of Yedwabne Hear a Calf Lowing — So They Checkinto all the Stables of the Area for the Contraband — But in TheirOwn ...About two hours before sitting down to the Passover Seder, the but-cher, Mr. Sovietarz from the Przystrela St. in Yedwabne, knockedon my door bringing an urgent note from the Rov in which heacquainted me with the fact that this righteous man had given awayall his meats to customers while forgetting to leave a share for his ownhousehold. Therefore he begged me to go to the stable of the policestation to kosher his calf. The Revered Rov further assured me thatby the help of G-d no evil would befall me for the sake of such amitzvah.I was in somewhat of a dilemma since I already awaited my U.S. Visashortly, and it was the very same police station of Yedwabne fromwhich I had to bring a sworn affidavit to the foreign consul in Warsawtestifying to my moral integrity and clean record.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL27One day a widow came crying to the Rov that she had mistakenlyexchanged with Avrom Itzchok her one hundred dollar bill, that shehad saved up for her daughter’s dowery. Thinking that it was a $5bill, she accepted a smaller amount in zlotys.The Rov sent for Avrom Itzchok to appear in his “Beth Din” (Rab-binical Court). He immediately came, but denied completely thewidow’s claim ; and restated what he had told her before, that therewas a $5 bill only, and that she must have lost the other bill aboutwhich she bothers him.The Rov immediately sent for Reb Yudel Boruch Velvels, the Gabaiof the “Chevra Kadisha” of Yedwabne to come and bring with himthe “Tahare board” (the board on which the “Chevra Kadisha” —the holy service-men prepare a body for burial). The Rov then,asked Mr. Avrom Itzchok to stand in front of that board, while heopened the Shulchan Aruch (book of Halachic Laws), and recited tohim the grave responsibility one undertakes when he swears a “Torah-vow”. Upon the gentle admonition of his admired and revered Rov,Reb Avrom Itzchok, the one who never feared death, broke into con-vulsions, wept out loudly, and begged the Rov forgivness for lying tohim, while he returned the difference of $95 to the widow.It is noteworthy that a sum of $95 was at that time in Poland a colossalamount especially for a poor butcher like Reb Avrom Itzchok. Wecan by this act, understand his high respect for the Rov, Reb Avigdor,whom he recognized to be a true selfless and superior human being.In Spite of the Serious Risk of High Jail Terms the ‘'Rov’ andthe “Shub” Supply Enough Kosher Meat to Yedwabne Jewryfor PassoverIt was on the eve of Passover 1937. The veterinarian who controlledthe Kosher meat business in Yedwabne had manipulated the situationso that the small quota permitted for the kosher trade was all exhaustedlong before the Holy Day of Passover arrived. We may realize whatsuch a decree meant for the Yedwabne Jews, if we remember thecircumstances of those days — that almost no dairy products couldbe used during that holiday. This story is told of those, as yet, peacefuldays that took place two and a third years before the 2nd World War.The residence of Reb Mendel the Shochet was surrounded by Polishsecret police around the clock, making certain that he could not defythe decree. In case one was caught preparing kosher meat, the inspec-26YEDWABNEStomach) of the opened carcas of a steer, belonging to Avrom ItzchokKosacki, the katzev. I noticed that it was a small cut piece of straw,an item of the animal’s regular menu, that he shoved off his fingers.The animal was passed through the inspeection as glatt kosher.At 6 A.M. on Thursday, when I came to the Beth Hamedrash, theRov was already waiting. He bid me to go with him to Avrom Itzchokin his ‘yatke’ (butcher shop). While walking, he explained, that hisfinger was hurting ... all night, because of the thought, that perhapsthere was also a needle or a nail together with the piece of straw thathe had shoved off his hand. In such a case the animal would have tobe ruled ‘treifa’ (prohibiteed for Jewish consumption).I called his attention to the fact that a needle or nail in the midst ofsuch a minute ‘shetzke’, as both of us had seen it to be, would be veryrare. And since its the animals diet we’d have to check every straw.Consider also that in the Rov’s gentle fingers even a straw would sticklike a needle. While discussing this, we entered the yatke.“Gooten Morgen” ! said the Rov. “Reb Avrom Itzchok, did youalready split up that steer ?” “What” ? exclaimed the butcher inhorror. “What Rebbs, is there perhaps a ‘shaale’ ? (an Halachic pro-blem on the Kashruth) on this animal ?” “Rebbe, it was borrowedmoney. I lose, G-d forbid, everything,” he continued to cry.“Quiet down”, begged the Rov gently. “Don’t take it to heart, buttell me, Reb Avrom Itzchok dear, how great would be the monetarydifference if you were to sell this meat to non-Jews. “Rebbe,” ex-claimed the buteher painfully, “perhaps even as high as forty zlotys.What will I do ? It is borrowed money. What shall I do ?”The Rov hastily took out his wallet, counted out 40 zlotys and happilygave it to the butcher, while ordering him not to sell the meat to Jews.Everyone knew that those 40 zlotys was the Rov’s full salary that hehad just received for his and the Rabbitzen’s weekly sustenance. Thatmeant, he chose to suffer a week’s starvation, rather than entertainan infinitesimal doubt of an Halachic problem.The Strongest Man in Town is Frightened of Taking an OothA high judicial case occured in Yedwabne which only the Rov RebAvigdor could solve. The preceding episode may explain what con-vinced Avrom Itzchok, the butcher, who was the tallest and strongestman in town, and who feared no one, and of whom it was said in Yed-wabne that “upon whomever he puts his hand, there will never growhair again”, -- to bow down and admit his error before the Rqy,HISTORY AND MEMORIAL25and his congregation of 1440 men, women and children were massacredby the Poles. Reb Avigdor of blessed memory stirred his belovedflock to die for “Kiddush Hashem” (sanctification of G-d’s name).They hugged and kissed their Rabbi and then carefully repeated afterthe Rov each word of “Viddui” and “Shma Israel” before their soulswere returned to the Creator.His greatness was displayed in many ways. Take for example, thetime when Rufke Ciesla’s flour mill caught fire. The people of Yed-wabne were fearful that the fire would spread and the shtetel wouldgo up in flames, for during its long history it had happened severaltimes. The wind was blowing toward the shtetel. The Rov walked overto the mill and humbly recited a few passages from his little “Tehilim”(book of Paslms). The townspeople noticed to their amazement thatthe wind abruptly changed direction. So it was said that the town wassaved thanks to Reb Avigdor’s prayers.It is noteworthy that the Rov never considered himself a ChassidicRebbe or, heaven forbid, a miracle worker. Rather, he was a humbleleader of his flock in the path of the Torah. His life style, sacrificingand caring so much for others while discounting his own self, wonhim the admiration of all who knew him.It was toward the end of 1936 when the infamous “Kosher LawOrdinance” was enacted in Poland. This law established a quota onthe number of live stock to be slaughtered kosher. The quota wasset so low as to ensure that the Jews would be denied kosher meat.In order to save the Yedwabne Jewish community from starvation, theRov asked me to take leave of the Lomza Yeshiva in order to acc-omplish myself in the Holy art of “Shechita Ubedika”.The Shochet of Yedwabne, Reb Mendel Norenberg was compelledto leave the town for six months of convalescence in the health spa atZacopanne. The Yedwabne Jewish community was unable to inviteanother professional ‘Shub’ for it feared that he may be unwilling toleave the town after Reb Mendel’s return. To support two ‘Shubim’was an impossibillity for its poor budget. In order, however, to fulfillthe tradition of two ‘Shubim’ the Rov used to accompany the ‘Shub’He also would decide on the spot Halachic problems that arose.On one Wednesday night, after the weekly market day, while the‘Katzovim’ (Jewish butchers) prepared their meats for the busy Thurs-day, in the then newly built packing plant in the ‘zaganik’ (small forest)of Yedwabne, it happened that the Rov touched the ‘keress’ (pontza-24YEDWABNEThe answer is simple enough. Thanks to the fact that they were trudgers(krichers), they fashioned tunnels while crawling under the freshmountains of snow immediately before it had a chance to harden.Yedwabner Jews then were true to an old saying : ‘Tf you cannot climbover — you creep under”.A Unique Discovery — How to Besiege Snow PilesOne day during a blizzard, I noticed an extremely tall person trudgingslowly, but surely from the shtetel towards the direction of our house.As this giant came closer, my anxiety grew. Who could he be ? Butas soon as he finally reached our yard, I was happily surprised toobserve it splitting into two separate acquaintances of mine.I rejoiced, discovering that this was my aunt Yenta Pecynowitz whocarried on her shoulders her son Yankel (my cousin Jakow Zofanin Yahud, Israel), from cheder. To protect both from the furiousblizzard, they had rolled one giant blanket around themselves so thatthey looked like one very tall and straight person.My aunt explained to me that her Yankele was on her shoulders fortwo good reasons. First, to save his young feet from hard trudging.Secondly, and most important, from his high perch he was able todirect her well — how best to trudge in the face of the blizzard, therebyavoiding large snow piles. Thanks to their ingenuity they made theirway home peacefully.the Rabbi of Yedwabne, Hagaon Reb Avigdor ByalystockyWhenever I think of the Rabbi of Yedwabne, or the “Rov” as hewas referred to, I experience a feeling of reverence — for he was trulya saintly man. His life was one of “Kedusha Vochesed” — “Holiness,truth and kindness”. I remember him well because I spent a gooddeal of my youth as his student. In fact, when the Rov conferred uponme Kabala, the certificate attesting to ones ability to engage in thekosher slaughter and inspection of animals according to Jewish law,he wrote of me, “Goodal A1 Birkai” — (“he was raised on my knees”.)This book recounts some incidents in the life of Reb Avigdor whichI witnessed. It also contains sworn affidavits from Mr. Itzchok Yankle(Yanek) Neumark, now residing in Australia and Mr. Avigdor Kochov(Stem), now living in Israel, describing his death. In the final momentsof his life when fire had engulfed the bam where the sainted RabbiHISTORY AND MEMORIAL23the “churban” (destruction). We blessed the small birds who carriedwater in their tiny beaks in an attempt to extinguish the fires of theburning “Beth Hamikdash”.He then dismissed us from the cheder at a much earlier hour, so thatwe would have time to run into the surrounding woods to pick thetraditional “shishkes” (bristle-berries) for Tisha B’Av.There are different interpretations for the reason of shishkes — throwingon Tisha B’Av. Our Rebbi held, that on Lag B’omer, when we fashionedfrom wood various kinds of swords and guns, and marched into thewoods singing Hebrew songs to comemorate the uprising of our historicheroes. Rabbi Akiva and Bar Kochba, so too the shishkes throwingduring Tisha B’Av carries the idea of learning to defend Eretz Israel.Today the shishkes become the most sophisticated Kfirs, Phantomsand F-15s. e.c.t..It is noteworthy, that the Rebbi didn’t mind when “Chevrah” throwingshishkes in the Shul during the reading of Lamentations did not misseven his own beard, for while he received his share, he felt pleasedthat his beloved disciples diligently carried out his instructions.He was the official ‘reader’ in the town’s synagogue, and in accordancewith our sages, he then represented the author of the ‘book’ beingread. Yet when he chanted, “I am the man that hath seem affliction,by the rod of his wrath” (Lamentations Chapter 3 Sentence 1) hemust have thought of the Psalmist who said “Thy rod and thy staff,they comfort me”. (Psalms 23 Sentence 4) when he felt a shishke enterhis beard.the Hard Furious Winters in YedwabneAs beautiful and pleasant as the Yedwabne weather was throughoutspring and summer, as it was surrounded by the most gorgeous pineforests ; so vicious were the cold winters.Who of us doesn’t recall the big snow storms that befell us shortlyafter our beautiful Sukkos Holiday. All the roads and by-ways werecovered, and mountains of snow formed. To try to climb over themwas nigh an impossibility. So what did the Yedwabner Jews do ?They were all productive, either professionals or business people, andcouldn’t remain idle at home even for one day. Furthermore, to myknowledge, the great majority of Yedwabner Jews wouldn’t miss onemorning or evening to go to Shul for services.So how did they struggle through a long, extended Yedwabner blizzard ?22YEDWABNEAlthough Tired and Hungry, he Trudged Far to Do the Mitzvahof Helping the SickOn Rosh Hashana 1923, our Rebbe Avrom-Aaron Danowsky, officiatedbeautifully, as usual, at the Mussaf services in the great Beth Hamedroshof Yedwabne. Since he also read the Torah and blew the Shofar, onecan imagine how tired he was at three in the afternoon, when theservices were just concluded.After greeting “Gut Yom Tov”, the Rebbi discovered from me, hiseight year old student, that my grandfather Reb Beryl the miller, wastoo sick to make it from his suburban residence to the town. As tiredas he was, the Rebbe immediately removed his “Tallis” and “Kittel”(vestments), took the Shofar and trudged the distance of 2 kilometersto cause an old sick man to rejoice with the mitzvah of Shofar.Our Love for ChederSince the “Cheder” schedule occupied our whole day, we rejoicedwhen we discovered that on a certain day we were going to be freedearlier than usual. Nevertheless we are unable to recall a day. Heavenforbid, that we intentionally missed “cheder”. Not one blizzardy dawnpassed when we children weren’t the first to trudge out a path on ourway to “cheder”, on which the rest of the towns-folks followed withtheir trudging.the Rebbi Avrom-Aaron, the MelamedWhenever I prepare to read the Torah or Prophets by its “trops” (Mas-soretic cantilations) the patriarchal figure of our Rebbi, Reb Avrom-Aaron appears before me. His introduction to each book, both inwords and melody, was so pedagogically potent, that even now, aftermore than 50 years his melodious voice still penetrates my soul, andI transmit it live to our appreciative students.In our minds, the Rebbi was then the Prophet Jeremiah when in hisforward to the Book of Lamentations, he chanted out the following :“Hert zich ain kinderlach ! Klogt Yirmeyohu Hanovi oif dem “chur-ban Yerusholaim”! He then started to interpret the text, imbuing uswith an admiration for each word emanating from the mouth ofJeremiah the Prophet.We students likewise recall the impressive lesson on Erev Tisha B’Av.At that time the Rebbi portrayed for us the rich Midrashic stories ofHISTORY AND MEMORIAL21“Kolner Pekelach-Pekewach” (Packages) and “Yedwabner Krichers”(trudgers). One may wonder, “why such an odd sounding nick-namefor our honored and always unblemished Yedwabne ?”The writer will attempt to portray an average section of YedwabnerJewish citizenry, starting with the 14 year old hero Itzchok Yankel(Yanek) Newmark, now in Australia, who in the year 1920 riskedhis life when he delivered an urgent letter to the Arch-Bishop in Lomza,under the direct guns of the anti-Semetic Gen. Haller’s army.

Many were the times, especially during a blizzardnight, when a horse-and-buggy was stuck in a ditch unable to moveon, that Rebbitzen Yoshpa, knowing that a baby’s arrival cannot wait,disappeared from the buggy and trudged for hours to find the snowcovered shed, where she brought joy and rescue to a poor Jewishfamily.Many of us “cheder” students recall how Rebbitzen Yoshpa wouldsave some rebellious or weaker ones among us, from the wrath ofRebbi Avrom-Aaron’s punishments.The reason was simple enough. Rebbitzen Yoshpa was consideredthe mother of the children, for in addition to her actual assistance atthe delivery, she was the “Zogerke” (leader of the services) in thewomen synagogue in Yedwabne, and she prayed that their mothersconceive and give birth to healthy children. She doubly deserved thetitle ‘merciful mother’.20YEDWABNEonly that the shtetel was destined to be inhabited by genuine finesilken ‘Yedwabner Jew’s in the TRUE sense of the word.

Then, as regimented soldiers, we, the 4—5 or 6 year olds,marched singing to the residence where our newest colleague awaitedus. We shared with him the finest that we then possessed, namely,the chanting of “Shma-Israel” by which the greatest in our nation’shistory had lived, and also ended their martyred lives !We were most interested in observing the infant’s facial expressions.We wondered what impressed him more; holy words that his youngsoul heard for the first time, or our sweet voices ?

Althoughhe was a Chasid and went occasionally to the Rebbe of Slonim, hedid not impose Chasidus on his Kehila. He was a very close friend ofRabbi Yechiel Mordechai Gordon, Dean of the Yeshiva of Lomza, andwas admired by the Yeshiva students.

For a short time they lived in Bialystok and thenin Tanbuv Russia where Rabbi Winer became Rabbi.At the end of the war 1918, Rabbi Winer tendered his resignation tothe Kehila of Yedwabne, explaining that he intended to move to EretzIsrael where he had been offered a position as Rabbi. That was hislife dream but it wasn’t fullfilled.

RabbiBialystocky was orphaned from his father at a very young age, buthe nevertheless received an intensive Torah education under the super-vision of his mother who had to operate a liquor store for a livelyhood.Rabbi Bialystocky spent some time with his mother’s brother. RabbiAvraham Ezra in Amdur. He also learned in the Yeshiva of Bialystok,and received his Smicha from Rabbi Avraham Launski of Krinek. In1885 he came to Kobo. There, he married Bluma, the daughter ofRabbi Daniel A.

The money was given to the committee for buying sforim (books)for the Beth Hamedrash (house of learning).It was told that since that episode, his wealth diminished graduallyand his standing in the community fell greatly.Yosef Shimeon Marcus’ impoverished children had to leave Yedwabnefor the wide world. The Grandson sold out the Grandfather’s uniqueRabbinic library to cover his financial needs, and the books ofeducation, he rented out to Yeshivah students.Nonetheless, Reb Yosef Shimeon Marcus of Yedwabne was registeredas a renowned person in the book “Toldos Haaretz”.RABBI MEYER ELIYAHU WINERRabbi Winer received his Talmudical education at the famous Yeshivaof Walozin during the years 5644—5647.

Then myfamily moved to Lomza. Since I was musically inclined, I was enrolledinto the well known Lomza Shul-choir under the directorship of Mr.Eisenstadt; who was later the choir conductor of the well knownTlomacka Synagogue in Warsaw. Our choir sang with the famousCantor Mordechai Hirshoff in the great Synagogue of Lomza.These experiences must have given me an added talent to appreciatea beautiful Shul. As soon as I arrived to the United States, I washappy to find just such a Synagogue in our Yedwabner Shul in N.Y.I recall an incident, when I noticed once a stranger who quietly spaton the beautiful shiny Synagogue floor. I became so outraged, thatas young as I was, I forced that elderly stranger to clean it up im-mediately, otherwise, “I would clean it with his own beard”, I said.He realized his misdeed, and thanked me for calling it to his attention.Louis Gordon has been for many years one of the most activeofficers of “Par Israel Anshe Yedwabne” in New York.A KOL NIDRE EPISODE IN YEDWABNEby Moshe Cinovitz and EliezerOne of the two Marcus brothers, Yosef Shimeon, was a central figurein Yedwabne in the 1850’s. As it seems from the chronicles of thosedays, he was priviledged with concessions from the Polish “Pritzim”.He came to be known as the only man who stood up against thespiritual leader of Yedwabne, the well known Gaon Rabbi YosefChover. This occurred during a “drosho” (discourse) held by therevered Rabbi at the Kol Nidre services.Hagaon Reb Yosef Chover mentioned a problem that caused(profanation of the name of G-d) which called for repentence. Thismatter was the contraband business through the Prussian border bycertain Jews, thereby avoiding taxes to the government. From hishonored place in the synagogue Yosef Shimeon Marcus, who felt guiltyfor his part in the business, then interrupted the Rabbi by exclaiming:HISTORY AND MEMORIAL15I recall that in 1922 when the Yedwabner were housed in their ownShul located at 216 Henry Street, my oldest brother had graduatedfrom medical school and my father gave a kiddush for the landsleitand my brother was called up to the Torah on that Saturday and re-cited the Haftorah. It was one of the highlights at that time to have aprofessional man in their midst.In 1926 we moved out of the East Side to East New York, Brooklynand my affiliation ceased, however my father continued to attend allthe meetings of the Chevra and was on many committees.I recall attending in 1935, the 50th year anniversary banquet. It was alavish affair and the committee was commended for a wonderful jobthey did.MR. KALMAN LASKY REMINISCES :I was born and raised in Radzilovo which is situated about 15 kilo-meters from Yedwabne. During my childhood years which were inthe beginning of the century. Yedwabne as well as Radzilovo wasburned a number of times.I recall, evenings when every one was looking out to the horizon pointingto Yedwabne. If the sky reddened, this was a certain sign that ourneighboring shtetel Yedwabne is G-d forbid, burning.The Radzilovo Jewish Community came to their assistance at once,by first loading full wagons of loaves of bread and other immediatenecessities which were dispatched quickly to the “Nisrofeem” (burnedout people) of Yedwabne.The same was vise-versa. Yedwabner Jewish people looked to ourhorizon and when they noticed it red they knew that Radzilovo is introuble, so they quickly came to our assistance.The reason for the oft burnings was due to the straw roofs on mostof the dwellings in the shtetel.These childhood reminiscences about such true devotion between thetwo towns Radzilovo and Yedwabne, must have been the main reasonwhy I joined the “Chebra Par Israel Anshe Yedwabne”, and I amhonored to be its active president for the past number of years,14YEDWABNEwas one of the most famous in Poland, burned to the ground it wasa tremendous shock to us. We immediately decided to take action. Theshock came too at the time when the honorable Rabbi from Yedwabne,Rabbi Wyner, was in New York visiting his son. He made an urgentappeal for help, inviting the world famous speaker, Reb Zvi HirshMaslanski, to a mass rally in the Beth Midrash Hagadol on NorfolkStreet. The two brilliant speakers combined to make the appeal asuccess, resulting in the rebuilding of the Shul in Yedwabne.The second big challenge to our past was the First World War.The town of Yedwabne was one of the towns most devestated inthe war. But this time too, as in the past, we offered our aid and sup-port. We organized a relief campaign, doing everything possible toextend a brotherly hand to those in need.In the same vain, our members did not forget their obligations to theYedwabne Shul in New York.

Our Charter under the name “Chebra Par Israel of Yedwabno,Russia” was incorporated with the State of New York on Nov. 23,1891.The tendency of newcomers to keep together in order to retain theirfamiliar way of life, is actually a universal characteristic. It is commonto immigrants of all nations and faiths. While among non-Jews thistendency was expressed by the formation of sports clubs and amuse-ment centers, Jewish immigrants founded Landsmanshaften, FraternalOrganizations and Societies. These Landsmanshaften groups servedpeople coming from the same home-town in the same way that thesport clubs served the non-Jews, by keeping alive among them anawareness of their common origins and common cultural heritage.The Synagogue, however, did much more than that. Not only was it ahouse of prayer, but it was also the place of education to each member ofthe family of all ages. The future historian may be correct in stating,that it was to the credit of the early Landsmanshaften-Synagogues thatwe have today a lively Jewry in the United States of America.The existence of over one hundred thousand Yeshiva and Day Schoolstudents in the U.S. today, which is in no doubt the nucleus of a Jewishfuture in the Western Hemisphere, is thanks to the wisdom of our earlysettlers like the Yedwabnerites in New York who had forseen the futureand therefore fortified it by spreading Torah education to all. “ParIsrael of Yedwabne” possessed not only active Chebras of studying‘Shas’, ‘Mishnayos’, ‘Mikra’, etc. for the elderly, but also supportedan intensive Torah education for the youth.Ninety five years ago these young immigrants from Yedwabne thoughtchiefly in terms of their home town’s traditional way of life whichcentered about the Synagogue.In their home town’s Beth Hamedrosh, all the important issues ofthe day were threshed out. It was therefore quite natural when thefirst score or so of our new-comers gathered in a rented loft on NewYork’s East Side to conduct Sabbath Services, that the dream to builda Synagogue of their own — a new Yedwabner Shul, took place atonce.In the Yiddish department of this book we find a number of articleschosen from the “50 Years Anniversary-Journal of the YedwabnerAssociation in N.Y.” published in 1935. We are moved by the devo-HISTORY AND MEMORIAL11THE YEDWABNER SHUL IN NEW YORKIt was in the middle of February 1938, when the Polish steamship“Battory” brought me into the New York Harbor.As Joseph (Gen. 37.16) said : ‘T seek my brothers”, my first desirewas to visit the beautiful shul that our Yedwabnerites had built andactively maintained on 216 Henry Street, on New York’s famous JewishEast Side.Upon entering this imposing edifice, I was met with many surprises.Firstly, I heard my home-town’s Yiddish by its musical connotations,and the “W” when spoken by a true Yedwabnerite is truly disting-uishable.Interestingly enough, the well known Yedwabnerits whom I’d metthen in the persons of: Reb Zundel Markowitz, Abraham Bromstein,Alter Goldberg, Itche Atlas, Mendl Kadish, Chayim Gordon, etc.were wondering whether I was a true Yedwabnerite, since my “L”wasn’t pronounced exactly as theirs. They had all left Yedwabne ascore or two years previously. They stated with pride : “and yet, theyhadn’t forgotten their mother tongue” ...This reminded us of an anecdote: Once a Jewish person, while visitingChina, asked where he may find a Shul in which to worship.When he finally reached one and tried to partake in the services, hisChinese counter parts pointed to him with the question : “But youdon’t look Jewish” ...It is noteworthy that even in Lomza, the “L” was pronounced likethe “W” as in Yedwabne ; but in its great Yeshiva which had over400 students coming from all over the world, with a United Nationsof dialects, a unified pronounciation was somehow formed.I observed that our landsleit were not overwhelmed by the hard citylife. The world’s large city did not take its toll from these lovelysweet mannered ‘silky-like Yedwabnerites’ (the word “Yedwabne”means ‘silky’ in Polish). These gentle folks remained genuine followersof our great tradition.When I commented on the complete attention to the services in thisSynagogue, I was enlightened by the officers, not with little pride, thatthis Synagogue’s constitution states distinctly that should one talkduring the services he would be fined with the amount of twenty-fivecents ($.25) for the first offense. That this amount equaled a monthsmembership dues, is also stated in the same constitution which wasduly passed and ratified by our New York Yedwabnerites in the year10YEDWABNEdiately using the milk to put out the blaze, she ran to the house fora bucket of water. By the time she returned, the fire had already en-gulfed many houses and reached the Synagogue, where were storedtanks of naphtha used for the hanging lamps. The wind then carriedthe flames through the entire community.Rabbi Eliyahu Winer, the Rabbi of Yedwabne, was visiting his sonin the United States. When he heard the terrible news, he immediatelycalled a mass meeting at the Synagogue of Yedwabne in New Yorkfor the purpose of raising funds to help the sufferers. With the assist-ance of Pinchas Turberg and his father-in-law, the famous orator TzviHirsh Maslansky, Rabbi Winer accumulated an enormous sum ofmoney that was forwarded to Yedwabne.In the newspaper Hatzfirah of September 17th, 1913, Z. Tasmovskywrites that a request for assistance was sent to the neighboring citiesof Shtucin, Wisna, Radzilowa, Lomza, Suwalk and Grodno. The appealstated, “During the night of September 17th, three fourths of the com-munity, including the beautiful Synagogue and its precious books,was destroyed within two hours. People ran from their homes withoutshoes or proper clothing. Hundreds are in the streets, without shelter,shivering from cold, hungry and thirsty. The more fortunate foundshelter in the pits in the fields ... Families of means are now totallyimpoverished. Those who had little, now have nothing They walk aboutwith pale faces begging for food and clothing. Now, winter approach-ing, we fear the danger of an epidemic of cold weather diseases. Some-thing has to be done before it is too late.Signed : Rabbi Eliyahu WinerR. Yaacov, the son of Shmaryahu BramsYonah, the son of Yitzchok Tikucinsky*.Most of the above-mentioned cities answered with some help, but thecity of Lomza, so close to us and with whom Yedwabne had businessconnections had not done a thing untill a small group of noble peopleformed an organization and undertook to help us with cash. Theyalso lowered the cost of building material for the reconstruction of themany houses that were burned in the fire in Yedwabne.HISTORY AND MEMORIAL9to girls wanting to know the prayers and how to read and write Yiddish.There were classes for boys where the melamdim taught prayers, Chu-mash and Rashi, Mishnayot and Gemara. The melamdim were oftwo types. Some were very old-fashioned, with the pointer and strapbeing the main method of teaching. Their classrooms generally con-sisted of one room with a kitchen. In this same room ate and sleptthe melamed and his family. In the middle stood a long table aroundwhich were seated the teacher and his students. These melamdim, inorder to increase income also gave private lessons during the day. Thepupils were then left unsupervised, using this free time, suppos-edly, in reviewing their lessons. Understandably, for the pupils thiswas a wish come true. That was when they almost tore the houseapart. The scolding and the screams of the rebbetzin were ignored.Even the Rabbi’s children joined in the free-for-all. Naturally, greatscholars were not products of such schools.There were also schools with more learned teachers with graduationcertificates, and properly furnished classrooms. Comfortable benches,desks with inkwells and places to keep books and writing paper madestudying more conducive. With such teachers and in this environment,students progressed in their studies and continued their search for know-ledge in renowned yeshivot. Many grew up to become great peopleamong world Jewry.THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEAUTIFUL SYNAGOGUE ANDTHE CITY OF YEDWABNE IN 1913All those who remember the Old Wooden Shul in Yedwabne, findthat there are no words to describe the beauty of the structure,inside and outside. It was praised by many periodicals of that time.From the Archives of Poland we learn that the Synagogue was al-ready in existance n the year 1771. That was the year it was expanded.Therefore, it is believed that the original Synagogue was built when thefirst group of Jews from Tykocin moved to Yedwabne in the year 1660.In September of 1913, a fire started in a bam, burned three quartersof the homes of Yedwabne to the ground and completely destroyed thebeautiful Synagogue and its precious books.A woman was milking her cow by the light of a candle. The candletoppled over and set fire to the straw in the barn. Instead of imme-8YEDWABNEStacked to dry in the sun. Members of the family were responsibe forthis phase. The colors of the wood and the various patterns in whichthey were arranged were an interesting sight. A favorite game of theyoungsters of the village was to destroy the orderly towers, until theanger of the owners brought the game to a halt. Punishment was de-clared. Those who destroyed bad to rebuild. This, naturally was alsoa game for the children as they competed to see who would put upthe most interesting structure.In our village there was no such thing as an industrial strike. All pro-duction came from the effort of the craftsman, with the help of familymembers. I am reminded of an unusual labor struggle. Aryeh, RebNachum Moishe Pyontkowski’s son, decided to strike against his father.And when Reb Nachum Moishe beat the culprit with an iron wheel-band, Aryeh yelled with pain and let his father know that “I am asocialist, I do not want to work overtime at night!’ The father wascompelled to send his son to America to prevent, G-d forbid, otheremployees from being infected by the disease of socialism.There were also in Yedwabne “village tailors”, people who went outto work in other villages. They would take along a sissor, a tapemeas-ure and an iron. Because they spent months working in the areas,they also brought with them several dairy pots, bowls, and cutlery toprepare food to keep body and soul together. Except for raw fruitand brown bread baked on a hot oven, or boiled aggs and rawvegetables, the tailors would eat no other food served by the farm folk.I recall that once a farmer insisted that the Jew eat with him. The in-vitation was refused, naturally. The goy, taking the refusal as an insult,was so angered that he threatened and was ready to kill. The tailorasked for time to say the prayer before death, and began to say“Chatati (I have sinned), Aviti (I have committed iniquity), Pashati(I have transgressed)”. The peasant’s terrible anger subsided, and theshaken tailor was permitted to go home.The life of the tailor was not an easy one. It was extremely difficultto push the needle through the fabric, even with an iron thimble, asthe cloth used by the peasants was very thick. When sewing machinesbecame known and the village people began looking for tailors withmachines, the Yedwabne tailors had to become more industrious andprove to their patrons that handmade garments were much betterthan machine made ones.Now we come to religious instructors (melamdim) and teachers ofvarious categories. There were private melamdim who gave lessonsHISTORY AND MEMORIAL7smiths and wheelmakers for spinning wheels. There were private andclassroom religious teachers, and teachers who held graduation cer-tificates which enabled them to teach in the more modern schools. Ilist together those who produced for holy requirements and thosewho looked after the mundane needs, since in Yedwabne all residentscame to morning and evening prayers and all studied Mishnayot orGemora around the table in the synagogue. These artisans rose quiteearly to go to morning prayer and only after a hearty breakfast didthey begin their daily work for which they earned a good living.There was no limit to the working day. As long as physical energypermitted, production continued. In early evening, still in their work-ing clothes, they managed to come to the synagogue and say the even-ing prayers and also study. Then, after supper they returned to finishtheir projects, often working late into the night. About the YedwabneJews can be said, “Ao/ hashoneh hallachot b*chol yom, muvtach loshehu ben-haolamlhaba. Shenemar: Halichot olam lo, al tikrei hcdichot,elo halachotJ' (All who study daily the traditional laws, are sure ofthe future world. It is written: '‘The manners of the world'. Do notread “Manners", but “Laws".) The ordinary laborers, even the haulers, were very law-abiding, their life style being based on the Law.They lived according the writings in the Shulchan Aruch.Surrounding Yedwabne were more than fifty villages. The farmers inthe region required shoes, clothing, products made of wood, ironand steel. They needed mills to grind their grain, presses to make oil,and factories to manufacture items of leather. Therefore, many Jewishcraftsmen settled in Yedwabne where they were sure of full employ-ment. Much of the output was made to order, but ready-made objectswere also sold at the Yedwabne weekly fair and in other city fairs.In my time there was no modem equipment for workers in our town.However, they managed to create by hand, products that were moreattractive and more durable than those manufactured with the latestmachines. Yedwabne shoes, clothing and furniture were renowned. AYedwabne spinning wheel was valued for the perfection of its construc-tion and the precision of its yarns. To the Yedwabne Fair came mer-chants from all parts of Poland and their purchases gave profitablereturns to the local merchants.The forests around Yedwabne were a source for the wood products.Rows of wagons filled with logs came in daily. Processing the rawmaterial until it was ready for converting into saleable items was anenormous undertaking. Logs had to be split into various sizes and6YEDWABNEIn the year 1829 they brought in textile workes from Lomza, althoughYedwabne already had its own ten master craftsmen. By 1853 Yed-wabne had one hundred different workshops and stores, with a popula-tion of 1,200 inhabitants. And in 1856 several fiber factories wereestablished and more of the same in 1895. This thriving industry wastotally destroyed during the First World War.In the year 1910 Yedwabne had 2,929 inhabitants. As a result of theFirst World War Yedwabne suffered more property losses than anyother city in the vicinity of Bialystok. Seventy-two percent of the houseswere totally destroyed. By 1916 the number of inhabitants decreasedto seven hundred. After rebuilding the city in 1921, there were 113houses and 1,222 inhabitants. In ten years the population grew to 2,167.During the Second World War, Yedwabne suffered greatly and lostmuch of its population. In 1941 one thousand and six hundred fortyJews from Yedwabne and the surrounding communities were murderedbecause they were Jews. After the war ended, in 1946, Yedwabne hada gentile population of 1,670, and in 1961 it grew to 1,899. Howeverthere were no Jews remaining.Yedwabne had only one public school. There was no railway or water-way, and very few communal facilities, therefore it developed veryslowly. The town measured four square kilometers. There are re-mnants of an old small mansion in the park. In the vicinity of Yed-wabne, at Rostki-Male, Yanczewko, one may find the well-knownMazowiecki Cemetaries surrounded by a stone wall.A conclusion may be reached that when Yedwabne obtained the sta-tus of a city in 1736, many Jewish families moved there from the cityof Tykocin. But from other sources we found that as early as 1664a few families had left for Yedwabne. They probably settled therebecause of the weekly market day, which was by then well established.The jusrisdiction for the Jewish communal and spiritual needs of Yed-wabne was then in the hands of the well established Jewish communityof Tykocin and its Rabbinate.CRAFTSMEN, RELIGIOUS TEACHERS, AND TEACHERSTziporah RothchildA large portion of the Yedwabne Jewish inhabitants were craftsmen —shoemakers, barrelmakers carpenters, tailors, wheelwrights, saddlersHISTORY AND MEMORIAL5MY HOMETOWN YEDWABNE, PROVINCE OF LOMZA,POLANDRabbis Julius Baker and Moshe TzinovitzYedwabne is located twenty-one kilometers northeast of the city ofLomza, in the district of Wiski, amidst the forests^ fields of green her-bage, and pasturage.From Polish sources we learn that in the year 1455 the village of Yed-wabne already had a church. It then belonged to Jan Bylicy who wasthe Judge of Wiski, and the forefather of the Yedwabinskis.In the year 1494 Yedwabne was comprised of twenty families. PawelYedwabinski, Ensign of Wiski, had obtained a permit to have a Mar-ket Day once a week on Wednesdays. This took place some time inthe 1680’s, since the nearby town of Wisno, which had an establishedweekly market on the same day, complained to the authorities that theWednesday Market Day was damaging their business. An order thenwas issued by Yan the 3rd Sobieski in the year 1688 to stop marketday in Yedwabne.In the year 1736 Yedwabne had a new owner, Antonie Rostkowski,“Stolnik’ of Lomza, (a high ranking official), and he obtained fromKing August 3rd the Magdenbrug rights to be a city. However, it is notknown whether the planning of the city with the big marketplace andfour small streets took place at that time or in the beginning of thenineteenth century. Prior to this occurrence, the land of the city, in-cluding the houses, belonged to the owners of the city, and the dwell-ers paid rents annually. From the latter half of the seventeenth cen-tury, to this time, Yedwabne belonged to the following families:Kraszewski, Lakowski, Krayewski, Rostkowski, Rembelienski, andZamoyski.In 1700 Yedwabne had fifty-two houses and four hundred and eighty-one inhabitants. In 1810 the population grew to five hundred and thirty-six inhabitants. The properties then belonged to the famous govern-ment official, Raimond Remblinski.In the year 1812 Yedwabne had an inn, a distillery, a brewery, brickfactory, candle factory, and fifty-six workshops, among them gold-smiths, dyers, weavers, shoemakers, and tailors. The city also had itsown doctor.The first textile factory was established in the eighteenth century byStanislaw Remblinski, who was a government official from Wiski.4YEDWABNEthe Yedwabner Relief Society of New York under the chartered name “PerIsrael Anshe Yedwabne” over 95 years ago. It continues among the finesthistoric “Landsmanshaften” to be dedicated to the purpose of aiding Yed-wabner Jews caught in the whirl of history, as well as aiding importantcharities here and in Israel.We hereby acknowledge their assistance towards the realization of thisvolume.This book is written as a tribute to those who have gone before us. So thattheir agony, their ideals and their martyrdom will not be forgotten, so thatthe cry of those who cannot cry, be heard in this Anthology : “Yedwabne —History and Memorial”.Indeed, the murderers did not only humiliate and butcher their victims, theywanted also to blot out their memory. They slaughtered them twice, reducingthem in Yedwabne literally into ashes, and then trying to deny their deed. Notto remember our martyrs would mean to become accomplices to the designof their murderers.This book is also meant to beware of our rights and liberties as free men ina free land, lest we be once more compelled to rehve events of history.“NETZACH ISRAEL LO YISHAKER” (Samuel 1,15)We are certain there will always be Jews, and, therefore, there will alwaysbe someone who will remember.JACOB ELIEZER BAKERHISTORY AND MEMORIAL3PREFACEThis book is dedicated entirely to the remembrance of the brethren of ourtown, Yedwabne.One of the main goals in publishing it, is to acquaint our “landsleit”, theirchildren and friends with the horrible facts of wholesale murder, immolation,and slaughter committed by the Nazis and Poles against our sisters andbrothers.What happened to our people followed the well known pattern that wasperpetrated by the Nazis and which was by their silence approved by thecivilized powers of the world.As I sought a keynote to this introduction, I was confronted with a numberof alternatives that struggled within me. Shall I weep over the completedevastation of my people, or shall I try to perpetuate the beauty and spiritualmeaning of my childhood memories ? Or shall I try to recapture the remnantswho are scattered the world over, and help them restructure their lives sothat they would be eternal representatives of our cherished tradition? I con-cluded that our chief objective is to be to bring to life the way our martyrslived, in order that we may learn for ourselves and posterity what kind ofmoral fiber it was that enabled our progenitors to build generations ofproud Jews in Yedwabne for more than 300 years until the 15th of Tamuz5701, July 10, 1941.In this book we find testimonies of seven Yedwabner Jews and onenoble gentile woman who witnessed the most heroic moments of the bitterend. After heinous attrocities by their gentile neighbours, who had obtainedpermission from the Nazi authorities, the weakened Jewish Community ofYedwabne, 1440 in number, were forced into a barn where they burned themalive.We are convinced that during the centuries of its’ existence, Jewish Yed-wabne had to face the same kind of rough, inhuman neighbours. Thus thequestion again is raised ; how did they manage to survive? By studying theirlives portrayed in this book, we may find the answer. For this reason wehave augmented the articles with a multitude of pictures of past and presentYedwabnerites who are scattered the world over, with some of the familiesdating back seven generations.True to a tradition of generosity, our Yedwabnerites in New York wereresponsible for countless community endeavors, such as the establishment of2YEDWABNEentire job involed which includes writing, editing, and all technicalwork, plus exorbitant financial outlays, were done by two people only.Because of this burden it is possible to find an error here and there.We therefore ask for the reader’s understanding and kind indulgence.Editors :Rabbi Julius L. BakerRabbi Jacob L. BakerReb Moshe Tzinowitz — ContributorTO THE READERThis book differs from the literally hundreds that preceeded it, in thatit appears in the two languages most commonly spoken by our peopletoday, in addition to “Yiddish”.Since the end of the Holocaust, we had time enough to learn theregrettable truth that most of the books written on that subject, inthe tongue of the Martyrs, “Yiddish” have lost their readers.It is a fact, that while up until about 15 years ago “Yiddish” was thedominant language at our Yedwabner meetings in New York, oneis unable to make himself understood in that language today.He is made to realize that up to 70% of his former audience simplycannot comprehend “Yiddish” anymore.We were forced therefore to rewrite, translate, and rearrange the majorportion of the book into Englsh and Hebrew, and approval was neededfor leaving a minor portion of “Yiddish”.We enriched the book with the addition of 50 pages filled with im-portant pictures of past and present “Yedwabnerites”, some datingback seven generations, and scattered the world over. This is meant toproclaim that in spite of the bloodiest Holocaust in our history,G-D and our people are alive! (see Sfomo-Deuteronomy \A—1).We were faced by hardships in gathering material, etc. The budgetwas so limited that we were faced by a decision ; should we hireprofessional editors and leave no funds to pay for paper, cuts, printingand binding, which would be editorial perfection without a book, orshall we toil by ourselves and see the book published.We have chosen the latter possibility and we beseech the reader notto view this book with a critical eye for literary invention, for ourprincipal aim was to perpetuate our Martyrs, and this goal we havehopefully accomplished.There is a Law, in the time of “Congregational Sacrifices”, that wethen gather into the Synagogues and into the Houses of Learning topray to the Almighty that he shall forgive the People of Israel”. Think-ing of our Martyrs’ public sacrifices, we gained strength to tirelesslycontinue and to spare no efforts in order to see this book completed.In spite of the indifference and lack of interest of many of our landsleitwho did not evaluate the historic significance of such a book, theIn our Hebrew SectionPageOutstanding Yedwabner Generosity Recorded Since The Year 1845 7Pinchas Turberg / A.
