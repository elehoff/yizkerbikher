The official, tall, thin, sixtyish.My mother fell to her knees. I had never seen her on her kneesto anyone before. He asks her to rise . . .“ (S.M.) It was July,1907. The invitation to Chirov was also an exploration ofmarital prospects, which did not materialize.(59) “How long,” the Hebrew words usually addressed to theAlmighty asking how much longer the wait will go on until theMessiah comes.Saul's sister Zlata joined him for a time in Berlin, but returnedto Dobromil, where during World War I she died of typhuscontracted while caring for her fiance ill of the same. RoisePerl died soon after, of grief, it was said. Hersh and Liebe werestill children when Saul left. They grew to adulthood, married,had children, and all of them, with Maier Treiber, and most ofthe community, perished in the Hitler holocaust. “Z’chor: re¬member.”83in 1907, was spokesman for the Social Democrats for many years,dying in World War II as a member of the Polish Government-in-Exile in London. He is prominently mentioned in the PrzemyslYiskor Book, but not in the Dobromil volume. Probably Dobromilnever heard of Lieberman’s association with Freud's noted discipleHelene Deutsch, n^e Rosenbach in Przemysl (L.M.).During the same years elections were held in Dobromil for aJewish communal body, the “Kultus." The community split onclass lines, the ‘well-to-do” forming one party, the small tradersand workingmen another. The latter nominated Zeisig the tailorand Hersh Flank the cobbler, but in a campaign marked byextreme hostility they were not elected.Petty as were the differences in wealth between employers andemployees, or between property owners and property-less, classhostility was all the more acute in the tight confines of the smalltown where everyone knew everyone else. (A poor “trager,” acarrier of burdens, went to his landlord's door on Yom Kippureve on the way to the synagogue to wish him a good year, andwas answered: ‘‘Whether you beg out for yourself a good yearor not, your house rent, ‘dire gelt' you must pay me tomorrownight as soon as Yom Kippur is over.”)Despite their defeat in the Kultus election, the faction of thepoorer and their sympathizers pressed their desire for a TalmudTorah (Hebrew School) to be set up afternoons with free tuitionfor the many children whose parents had no money for a‘‘cheder melamed” and so were growing up ignorant of thetraditions which the Kultus was supposed to guard. Chosen asspokesmen were Jonah Schmul-Leib's, Aryeh Drucker and MosheSchmul Leib's. They first had to track down where the Kultuswas holding its meetings in private, almost in secret. WithJonah, a sick man, coughing as he banged on the table, theyemphasized their demand that the Kultus live up to its respon¬sibility. They won agreement. Dr. Brauner, then vice-chairman ofthe Kultus, was deputed to get it under way. A tax of twogreitzer a week was levied on all ‘‘balabatim” (householders)to support it, and Reb Mendele Spatz, an old dedicated man,volunteered to go from door to door to collect the tax. MaierTreiber was appointed the melamed (S.M.).(58) Poborcia, mispronounced ‘‘podbortza” by the Jewishpopulation, was the local office representing the central govern¬ment on taxes, military conscription and other matters. Apartfrom obtaining the workbook, there had probably never been82(57) In another manuscript, Saul Miller elaborates on thepolitical life of the time. Dobromil was governed by a burgo-meister and a rada (town council), chosen by vote of theproperty-owning householders. For a long time the burgomeisterwas Dr. Zwicklitzer, a tall stooping figure sporting a pince-nezon a black ribbon. (As a -physician, he tried to enforce thesanitation regulations strictly. He was known to be taciturn,examining the sick, saying nothing, but writing a prescription;but if he would say “hm, hm,” and cough twice, this was under¬stood to indicate that the patient was on his way to the otherworld. His fee was two crowns, one gulden, but he often didnot charge the poor). Jewish interests were represented by twoprominent Jewish residents who served in an adjunct capacityto the Rada. One of these was Reb Yosel Gershtler, a Tshort-kover “chassid" who wore the typical black cloak, short trousers,high white stockings, leather slippers, a long Israel “tallis-katan”with long wool fringes, and very long “payos.”About 1905 was introduced elections by manhood suffrage forrepresentatives to the Parliament in Vienna. Election was to beby ballot distributed to the voters, to be returned in envelopeson a certain date. There were two main candidates for thedistrict which included Przemysl and Dobromil: the establish¬ment (“reactionary”) candidate, a rich and titled landownerwho lived most of the time in Paris, and the “socialist” HermanLieberman.In Przemysl police turned off street lamps and broke upworkingmen’s meetings by using truncheons on their heads. InDobromil the police ruled that no meeting could be held on theone day that workingmen could attend on the ground that itconstituted a disturbance of the Sabbath, but Lieberman's sup¬porters assembled to hear his spokesman in a barn on a Saturday.In Dobromil, the local powers, relying on the inexperience ofthe Jewish voters, issued the ballots with the name of the“reactionary” candidate entered by a rubber stamp. Saul Miller,teenager, came home for Friday evening from his apprenticeshipwork, saw the ballot so marked, tried to erase the name, spoiledthe ballot and created a family panic till Maier Treiber obtainedanother pre-marked ballot from the Magistrat on Monday (S.M.).Peculiarly enough, it was from the harsh tailor employers thatSaul heard about May Day demonstrations in Przemysl, and itwas their copies of Naprzod that he used to snatch a glance atwhen they were out at “Mincha-Maariv.” Lieberman was elected81deaf-mute apprentice, who had been to a special school for thedeaf in Vienna.In one room there they had three sewing machines, a cuttingtable, a sewing work table, two beds, two bench-beds, a com¬mode, a wardrobe closet, a cloth storage closet, a bread closet,a wicker chest and the essential keg of water. They also had asmall “Aron-Kodesh," (cabinet for a Torah scroll) becausethey sometimes held services there. Six adults slept there, witha few chickens for good measure. Leizer was asthmatic, andhad a violent temper. It was told of him that with his bare handshe had once torn apart an unfortunate chicken that happenedto flutter on to the work table. In contrast, his wife Sura was agood natured and warm hearted person.In another manuscript Saul Miller wrote at great length evenmore bitterly of his sufferings here, where he was bound withoutany hope of release, kept busy with menial chores so that therewas little time to learn the skills he wanted and was entitled tolearn, and constantly subjected to sarcastic abuse from Leizer:“Such a topcoat you need to wear already, burlap sacking isn'tgood enough for you?"The ensuing winter was especially severe and Leizer becamevery sick. On a Thursday the whole household stayed up allnight reciting the Psalms over and over on behalf of his recovery.Next day Dr. Zwicklitzer, the physician-burgomeister, examinedhim, and with his too-well known double cough pronounced thefatal prognosis. Suspending all work, they sat with him till hedied at eleven that night. After the week of mourning (“shiva"),it was decided that the older brother Berele would continue asjourneyman, while the younger David would take over as mastertailor. David was “modern-worldly,’’ cut his hair German style,trimmed his beard, talked politics, read the Naprzod, but yethe was the master in the facings incident (S.M.). (There is noreason to doubt the accuracy of these reminiscences, but in otherrelationships some of these persons may have been most ex¬emplary (L.M.).(55) These three verbs are from the Book of Esther 3:13, whereHaman proposes to annihilate the Jewish population of thePersian Empire.(56) In spite of agreement, at the end of that year the mastertailor refused to give Saul the journeyman certificate to whichhe was entitled, only releasing his workbook (S.M.).80using a larger cross stick, was “kitshke." The order of players,or sides, was decided by a counting out rhyme of uncertainetymological origin which sounded something like this,ooh-er boo-er abbakvantin kvintin dzhabakvantin kvintin essooh-er boo-er dzhabakvantin kvintin pyess. (L.M.) .(53) The ready-to-wear tailor was Itzik Sura-Rivala’s, whosewife Ettel was sister to Zlata, mother of Roise Perl who wasSaul's mother. They had a son Shoil named for the same ancestoras Saul Miller; a daughter Raisel, after a grandmother; a sonAaron-Samuel, and a son David-Hersh. After the incident withthe rolls of cloth, Saul's mother made him gloves. With charac¬teristic pettiness, the privilege of collecting the cotton wastewas after a time taken away and reserved to the tailor's sonShoil. It would seem that this was connected with Saul's leavingthis tailor, and working, shortly before his thirteenth birthday,as “mehlmester" (flour measurer) on matzos for Rivvy Moshele's.When it was arranged for Saul to return to Itzik for a secondyear after that Passover, it was with the understanding that hewould receive fifty greitzer weekly for his work finishing by handsewing what could not be done on the sewing machine. Thiswas for his own clothes (he was able to buy himself a coat,hat and shoes; his food came from his own parents). In additionat the following “Pesach" he got the (for him) memorable topcoat made to order at the custom tailor's for whom he laterworked as apprentice (S.M.).“Shir Ha-Maalos:'' literally, the title of certain psalms, (Psalms120 to 134), which is variously interpreted; but also the namefor an amulet using Psalm 121 with superstitious inscriptionsadded. “Meila": = well, so.(54) Second apprenticeship at Leizer's shop; This was a formalapprenticeship, with a workbook issued by the Magistrat, andretained by the master tailor as total control over the apprentice.“Schneider ben schneider;'' a joke, since there is no such scrip¬tural verse.Leizer was married with Sura, and they had five sons: one hadhis own separate shop, two worked as journeymen with the father;one, of Saul's age, was also there learning, and was a goodfriend; and one was still in “cheder." At times there was also a79an ‘aliyah’ for Bar Mitzvah. That morning at the big synagogueI first put on ‘tefillin’ and after the services, the worshippersjoined in a toast with a fine aquavit, responding with a long‘ah, ah, ah' followed by an ‘oh, oh, oh, the real goods'. Fatherhad brought a very special brandy for the occasion. At home mymother Rose of blessed memory had ready an outstanding repast.That day I did not have to go to work at my apprenticeship"(S.M.).(51) ^Chicken feathers abounded, being used in pillows, mat¬tresses and bed cover, as well as coming from the fowl whosefeathers were plucked at home before cooking. The ‘‘yarmulka"is the small skull cap, worn at all times by orthodox Jews inaccordance with ancient decorum which required that the headbe covered in the presence of higher authority, and since one isalways in the presence of God, at all times the head is to becovered. Actually this incident in the classroom happened onlyonce, but in that milieu, taking a "yarmulka" off someone's headwas a tremendous offense to his religious sensibilities (L.M.).(52) The third and fourth years in the public school werehampered by economic distress at home. Saul peddled writingpaper to his classmates for his bread. His apprenticeship beganduring his fourth school year. Since neither father nor motherhad any such schooling, they could offer no help. German cameeasy, but Polish and Ruthenian were a problem, so that at timeshe had to turn to other schoolmates for help. The Przemysluncle, whose son became a bookkeeper, made some suggestionof a higher school in Przemysl. But Maier Treiber demurred: inaddition to the family's financial difficulties, he worried that insuch an "advanced and modern" city, his son's "Yiddishkeit"(adherence to tradition) would be affected (S.M.).In a schedule of public school mornings and "cheder" allafternoon, Saturday restricted by religious observance, andSunday a workday, it is clear why there is no mention of sports,athletics or play anywhere in these reminiscences (and perhapsan explanation for the boisterousness sometimes tolerated in thesynagogue). One game that Jewish boys played was "ik," some¬what as follows. A stick about two feet high was stuck into theground. At the top a small piece of wood, about two or threeinches long, notched on one side, was balanced. This piece wasstruck a glancing blow by another stick, so that it flew somedistance forward. The piece which flew furthest won. A variant.78in Rostov-on-Don I visited a family of cultured, professionalpeople, five adults of three generations, sharing a similar hovel,no better being available (L.M.).(47) On beginning his second year at the public school, Saulhad got a new pair of boots measured and made to order byElye the cobbler. On this occasion when he was sent into thepriest's class, he was required to take off the boots to make surethat he stayed. The questions asked by the priest were more thanjust the names of the patriarchs: the lesson happened to be inthe first books of the Bible, which Saul could answer very well,making a good impression on the priest (S.M.).(48) Reb Naftali Fuchs figures prominently in the DobromilYiskor Book. (He was grandfather to Joseph Fox, who contributedlargely to that volume using the signature “A Dobromiler.") Heused to lead the prayer service in the synagogue and act as the“ba’al-kore," reader of the Scriptures. He also had a one room“cheder,” but large and bright. He had five children. Kalman, orKalmaleh, was one, a “maskil," (an intelligent fellow of worldlyoutlook by Dobromil standards), who read German and Polishbooks. On occasion, when Reb Naftali was called away for otherduties, Kalmaleh would take over the “cheder," and on thequiet would share some of his German and Polish readings withthe boys. Reb Naftali also taught his pupils letter writing (S.M.) .Rashi is the most famous of commentators on Hebrew Scripture,Rabbi Shlomoh Yitzchaki. Moses Alshech, a sixteenth centuryrabbi at Safed, also wrote commentaries, which must have had aspecific appeal to Reb Naftali; the name of Alshech wouldordinarily not be twinned with the name of Rashi.(49) The Kriftscher Melamed had married a Dobromil girland settled in her town. They shared lodgings with Yuskala theApple-dealer, in one cottage divided by a clothes “shafa" (war¬drobe) (S.M.).(50) “From the time I quit my last harsh Kriftscher Melamed,my father of blessed memory used to study with me at home.Each ‘Shabbos' we would review the weekly Torah portion, withRashi. In winter, we added a chapter or two of Psalms, in sum¬mer Pirke Avosy the Adages of the Fathers. As I approachedthirteen, he taught me from the “Kitzur Shulchan Aruch' (Ma¬nual of Observances) the rules of ‘tefillin.’ On a Monday orThursday nearest my birthday, I was called to the Torah with77used to not or^ly visit the sick, but in severe cases he would situp all night caring for an invalid so that the family could sleepand be able to care for the sick person during the next day.He also helped bereaved families in arranging their funerals,professional undertakers not being available. (S.M.).(44) He was quoting the blessing from Genesis 48:20. “Tefil-lin," mentioned above, are phylacteries, small cubical containersin which Scriptural passages are enclosed, attached to leatherstraps, which are worn at morning worship, one on llie armand one on the forehead.Whether Saul Miller retained in his memory these details fromage three, or whether they are filled in from what he was told,or saw from others: they are here given as he wrote them inhis manuscripts.(45) Leib Itzik was a tall, thin man with a sparse black beard,married to Beiltshe Kuppala-Melamed’s, a pale, ailing woman.He ran a “dardaki cheder,” a beginners’ school. Among his“belfers” (he usually had one at a time) were Yossel Hoiker(= Joey the Hunchback) and Krumer Avraham (= LameAbraham) : the latter afterwards married Saul’s aunt Zeesel. LeibItzik used to say that little Saul had “a goot keppel zum lernen,”a good head for learning. Saul’s sister Zlata also began “cheder”with him. “Chumash” study began at age five, and in “SeferVayikra,” (Leviticus) in the very difficult chapters on priestlyritual and temple sacrifice (probably because that was the por¬tion of the Torah being read that week at the synagogue.)Difficult as it was for them to make a living, Saul’s parentsstill found the money to pay tuition to the “melamed,” and togive a meal to the “belfer” and firewood to the “unter-belfer”(assistant) who came in the morning to pick up the child andwith him go through the children’s morning liturgy, the “Bro-chos” (blessings) on arising, the “krias shma” (reading the pro¬fession of faith) and kissing the “tzitzis” on the “arba-kanfos.”The other “dardaki melamed” in Dobromil, Melech Melamed,had two “belfers” and was used by wealthier families (S.M.).(46) At Hershele’s there was also a little dipping into “BavaMetzia” and “Bava Kama,” the beginner’s introduction in Tal¬mud. The “cheder” room was also the family bedroom andliving room, occupied by Hershele, his wife and three children,and a second couple who shared the quarters (S.M.). (In 1966,76was sinful to travel all the way from Dobromil to see a stageplay. The other time it was to say goodbye, before leaving forAmerica.Devorah was married to Leibush, who could not make aliving (“he was a shtekel drayer, a cane-twirler”), so she workedhard as a fruit peddler. They had a blond freckled daughter wiihaching eyes, and a son and a daughter all younger than Saul.Saul was named for his mother's grandfather Shaul, fatlicrof Reeven the glazier. Reeven travelled all week around tliecountryside installing and repairing windows and on the sidesold ikons to the peasants. His first wife, Zlata, mother of RoisePerl (Saul’s mother), died when Roise Perl was six or seven.Reeven’s second wife was Chaye Milka’s, with whom he had twodaughters Zeesel and Breindel, and two sons Yusha and Hersh(they brought their glazier trade to Columbia Street in Man¬hattan.) Reeven “had a horse and wagon, a dog, and a birdin a cage, but no parnossa’’ (S.M.) . Chaye Milka’s helped bypeddling, pots, dishes, apples, cider, anything.Roise Perl began to do sewing for her living at an early age,earning a greitzer for a child’s dress, working for TsipporehMechel's. Later she also worked on men’s clothes. She never hadany schooling, but by her own efforts taught herself to read andwrite Yiddish.Maier Treiber was first married to a cousin, by family arrange¬ment, to a girl stricken by a disease known to be terminal, “sothat she would not be compelled to arrive in the other worldwithout having had a wedding ring’’ (S.M.). She died a fewmonths later. Maier and Roise met rather romantically: he wasat his stand vending coral beads when she came over to buyherself a string. She was considered good looking; a bit taller thanhe. She was then already working a sewing machine, makingdresses and aprons for peasant children. Since corals were be¬ginning to go out of fashion, she taught him also to use themachine, and he added these articles to his market day circuits.In Hebrew and Yiddish he was well taught, but not in Polishor German. (He first learned to sign his name in those scriptswhen he was married). About 1906 he was chosen to be school¬master (“melamed”) at the newly founded communal school forJewish children whose parents were too poor to pay tuition,teaching Hebrew language, “Chumash,’’ the prayer book, andreading and writing Yiddish.Maier Treiber was also called the “Kranken Vater,’’ father ofthe ailing, because as a prime mover in the “Chevra Lina,” he75tury was Feige Tshupper, whose name was taken by the LadiesAuxiliary to the Dobromiler Men’s Verein in the United States.On the occasion of a great and joyous family festivity, when alltlie guests were at their happiest, she suddenly appeared wrappedin a shroud, evoking loud screams and general disorder, whileshe harangued the assemblage on the importance of always re¬membering their mortality (L.M.).(42) “Tol’dos”: this is Genesis 25:19 through 38.There was a particular reason for this practice of nicknames.The civil authorities did not recognize a Jewish religious cere¬mony as validating a marriage, only recognizing Christian churchceremonies or civil weddings. Birth certificates for children ofJewish parents married only in Jewish ceremonies would listbotli parents but gave to the child the mother’s family name, notthe father’s name. Hence Saul Miller (originally: Mehler) wasthe son of Maier Treiber who was the son of Berish Sacher,and received as surname his mother’s maiden name, the nameof his maternal grandfather. However, these practices were notuniform, and not all children had birth certificates issued, sothat practice varied from family to family. The Loewenthals ofDobromil who came to America used their father’s surname.(L.M.)(43) Saul Miller never knew his father’s parents, who both diedearly, the mother first, Berish-Issachar Sacher later of a heartattack. Berish was survived by a second wife, who continuedBerish’s trade of traveling the circuit of market days and fairsselling red coral beads on commission. Maier Treiber neveracquired any skilled trade, but also followed their footstepsselling coral beads: hence his nickname, Maier Koralnik. As ayouth, in winter, when these fairs were not available, he alsoworked as a “belfer,” that is, a “bei-helfer,” an assistant in the“cheder” of Kuppala Melamed, giving little children their firststart in Hebrew studies.Maier had a brother Leib and a sister Devorah, who alwayslived in Przemysl. Leib was a cobbler who made boots andshoes to sell at the Friday market in Przemysl. He had a sonwho became a bookkeeper and two daughters. Saul Miller visitedhim twice in Przemysl. Once it was in a “Choi Ha-Moed’’ (middledays) of “Succos," when he went to see a play (possibly JosephLatainer’s David's Violin). Hot-tempered Leib was shocked: it74Saul Miller’s birth certificate, with parents’ names in “6” and “7.”The dates in “2” and “3” were entered wrong, late by a week.73I Serach come before youTo tell you great good newsTo gladden your heart.(Such tidings to relateIs really something great).Lo, Uncle Joseph is still alive.(Bringing someone such newsGod rewards double, and how)And he is ruler nowOver all the land of Mitzraim,Yes ruler over all Mitzraim,And now has two sons alsoMenashe and Ephraim.US'? ,nnci]nniD nncui v.122^ nnujniu\])}Rj u nnimn r^R12 R1 2R1 VR^iDV MIT n]nTn 13T1Dwm 1}J iTTltUn RJRDMgD ‘?9D x}^r\R'iyiR ^D2 ‘?cuiD NiniDM^^T] YIR ‘?DT ‘PQJin mniDun urn M DJ.DMgm iTQJJ^]Serach was a daughter of Jacob’s son Asher, but the role mayhave been sung by a little boy.The memoir omits “Chamishah Osor B’Shvat” although onthat fifteenth day of the month “Shvat” Dobromilers did observethe traditional “New Year’s Day of the Trees’’ by eating driedfigs, dates, raisins and “buckser” (carob, St. John’s Bread).(39) Winters in that region are severe. “People going out onthe roads towards country villages would be warned not to stopto rest lest they fall asleep. I remember one old clothes dealerwho was found frozen to death that way, and there were others”(S.M.).(40) Maier Treiber was quoting Joshua 6:1 about the siegeof Jericho.(41) It seems characteristic of an ingrown society that it tendsto accumulate patterns of enduring hostility in behavior. Ihave seen such patterns in university faculties, in trade unionlocals, in associations of hotel executives, and in families, wherethe same people face each other and few others over longperiods of time. From former Dobromiler in America, I haveheard both stories of charity, love, warmth and devotion, andincidents of “kriegereien,” feuds; “opmasseren,” tale-bearing;“sin’as chinom,” unprincipled factional hatred; and plain cruelty(L.M.).An instance of their mode of thought I heard told with respectand admiration by an ex-Dobromiler in America: The mosthighly revered woman in Dobromil in the late nineteenth cen-72this ceremony held in the hands together with an “esrog,” acitron like a lemon.(35) “Simchas Torah” is the festive day of ‘‘rejoicing in theTorah.” It comes at the end of ‘‘Succos,” and marks the com¬pletion of the year-long cycle of reading the ‘‘Five Books ofMoses” in weekly installments. (This cycle of reading beginsagain on the Sabbath following.) On ‘‘Simchas Torah” the hand-inscribed scrolls of these five books are paraded round the syna¬gogue in circular processionals, with children bringing up therear waving paper banners, or a stick to which often lit candlesused to be attached. ‘‘Atto Hareiso” are the first two words ofthe passage taken from Deuteronomy 4:35 which is recited at thestart of these processionals (‘‘Hakafos”) . ‘‘Mussaf” is the addi¬tional prayer service at midday, one of the distinctions betweenany ordinary day and a holy day. ‘‘K'dushah” (sanctification) isordinarily considered a particularly sacred moment, not to beinterrupted even by a whisper. ‘‘Auctioning”—to raise funds.(36) The Fast of Esther precedes the Purim festivity, com¬memorating the fast day recorded in the Book of Esther. ‘‘Onceon a Monday or Thursday reading of the Torah in the synagogue,the heavy scroll was dropped while being ceremonially held uphigh. That day the whole shtetl fasted” (S.M.) .(37) ‘‘Draydel,” a four sided spinner or top used in a chil¬dren’s gambling game for beans or other tokens. The initialsdetermine winnings and losses, ‘‘put-and-take.” The initials arealso read in the sequence nun, gimel, heh, shin.(38) Children went from door to door with the traditionaljingle: ‘‘Heint is Purim, morgen is ois, git mir a groschen, undvarft mich arois,” (Today is Purim, tomorrow not, give me apenny, and throw me out).In his youth Maier Treiber was a ‘‘Purim-shpieler,” playingYehudah (Judah) in ‘‘Joseph and His Brothers.” Do texts ofany of these survive? At age eighty-nine, Saul Miller repeats withpleasure a song from that playlet taught to him as a child byMaier Treiber, originally sung by a juvenile character, Serach,who comes to tell grandfather patriarch Jacob the astoundinggood news that his long lost son Joseph is alive and ruler inEgypt. It is in mixed Hebrew and Yiddish rhyme,71means little body covering. When worn as an outer or publiclyvisible garment, it is called a “tallis-katan," a *'small tallis'*(“tallis” being the large prayer scarf or shawl worn by men duringservices in the synagogue).(30) “Koiletsh" is the kind of “chaleh" (white bread loaf)made in twisted braids of dough. The Fast of Gedaliah is ob¬served the day after the second day of “Rosh Hashanah," on thethird of Tishri, in commemoration of the assassination of Geda¬liah, appointed by the Babylonians to govern Judea after thefall of Jerusalem, as told in the book of Jeremiah, chapters 40and 41.(31) Honor thy father: fifth of the Ten Commandments,which adds “and mother.”(32) “Kol Nidre:” This is the opening chant of the “YomKippur” service, in a very' moving melody and very movingwords, variously interpreted, but reflecting the persecutions en¬dured through the centuries. The major implication is that anyand all oaths (“Kol,” all, “nidre,” vows) imposed and takenunder duress, meaning in particular forced conversion to otherreligions under threat of death, are null and void: a mostpainful declaration to have to make.“Awesome as was Kol Nidre eve, even more dread and awesomewas the final closing hour of Yom Kippur, the Ne’ilah [dusk ofthe next day: ‘ne'ilah’ means closing, and for the believing, itis the time of the last possible appeal for forgiveness and for life.]The long candles, still burning from the night before, werebeginning to flicker out. The worshippers huddled together roundthe dimming candles to see their ‘Machzor’ texts. Up and downon the white walls there shifted the shadows of the figures bentover their prayer books, so that to a child’s eye they seemed allheadless. And it was whispered that any one who saw his shadowso headless would (‘chalilah’) not see the next year through”(from another ms. by Saul Miller).(33) “Succah:” A strictly temporary booth, with a roof leftincompletely thatched or covered through which stars must bevisible, commemorating the tents in the desert wanderings be¬tween the exodus from Egypt and the settlement in Canaan.(34) The “lulav” is an assembly of long palm leaves, some¬thing like a sword held in a hilt of myrtle and willow leaves, in70Because he was not religiously observant (‘nisht a frumer’) hewas interred there at the highest point, where no one else wasburied. (It was said that his restless soul could be seen therewalking at night.) Quite opposite, in contrast, was the white¬washed little hut over the graves of the shtetl’s “Tzaddik," RebShimon Deitsh and his wife. Every ‘Tisha B’Ov’ all, young andold, would enter into that little hut. The town ‘balebatim’poking around the old tombstones said the shtetl was somehundreds of years old. Overseer of the consecrated ground was a‘Yeed' with the name Yakov-Melech-the-Beis-Olom-Yeed. He livedwith his family in a cottage on one side of the cemetery. Onthe other side was the tent into which were brought the Jewishdead from nearby hamlets. Characteristically, this cemetery familywas different from the shtetl dwellers. By them they ate onlyblack rye bread, white ‘chaleh’ only on Shabbos. I used to dropby there almost every Shabbos because I had a good friend whowas a grandson of Yakov-Melech-the-Beis-Olom-Yeed. They wereconsidered rather uncultured (‘prost’), only on Shabbos werethey seen at the Big Synagogue, on the side where the poorerfolk were found. They were all bronzed from the sun, like realpeasant people. They were free from any fear at all, and evenused to go to sleep on a pile of hay right near those who wereburied. With my father I would always visit the grave of mygrandfather Berish-Issachar of blessed memory who lived of hischoice always in the big city of Lemberg but asked to be buriedin Dobromil where he was born.” (from other mss by SaulMiller) .(28) “Chalilah:” a frequent interjection in Yiddish, whenused seriously means ‘‘God forbid” or ‘‘Perish the thought.” Hereused ironically, hence translated ‘‘perish forbid.”(29) In the Bible, in Numbers 15:38—40, the Children ofIsrael were directed to wear “tzitzis” or knotted strings, or fringes,on the corners of their garments as a constant reminder of theirreligious faith and duties. Accordingly, religiously observant Jew¬ish men, as a symbol of this constant awareness, wear a garment(as a practical matter, more often, an undergarment) consistingof an oblong cloth with an opening to go over the head andshoulders, like a bib covering front and back, with the knottedstrings (“tzitzis”) at each of the four corners. “Arba-kanfos”means four corners, the Hebrew name for this undergarment,which in colloquial Yiddish is called a ‘‘leib-tzu-dekel,” which69enian peasants, and a small chapel for (a dissenting sect?) ofpoor peasants. Another Polish institution was the Dom Narodni,or “people’s house,” housing their nationalist-patriotic associa¬tion, and their athletic “Sokol” (“Falcon”) organization. As faras the Jewish population of Dobromil was concerned, all of theseinstitutions might as well have been on the planet Pluto. (L.M.)(25) Having acquired in Imperial Austria-Hungary and Im¬perial Germany, a passionately anti-militarist outlook, reinforcedby hearing August Bebel in Berlin, Saul Miller treats these “LagB’Omer” excursions rather negatively. These observances arerelated to the unsuccessful uprising against Roman rule led byBar Kochva (about 131-135) and supported by the martyredRabbi Akiva. According to one tradition, “Lag B’Omer” marksone day in that tragic struggle in which Rabbi Akiva’s pupilswon a victory, in what was otherwise a long series of defeats.This tradition seems to have been bowdlerized by some laterrabbis (who, for reasons both good and bad wanted to playdown the idea of armed struggle) into a story that a plagueraging among Akiva’s students ceased on that day. Furthertradition says that when the uprising was crushed. Rabbi Shimonben Yochai, disciple of Akiva, hid in a cave for many years. Hispupils came to consult him, surreptitiously, and they carriedbows and arrows in case they had to defend themselves against astray Roman patrol. To me, this tradition of an outing intothe woods, connected with archery and a pilgrimage to a cave,suggests roots far deeper, in Stone Age times, when hunters gath¬ered for rituals at caves like Lascaux and Altamira. (L.M.)(26) The “Tenth of Tevess,” the “Seventeenth of Tammuz”and the “Ninth of Av” (=“Tisha B’Ov) ” are anniversaries re¬lating to the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple.The siege of Jerusalem by the army of Nebuchadnezzar of Baby¬lon began on the “Tenth of Tevess.” On the “Seventeenth ofTammuz” the city wall was breached and the city thereby taken.On “Tisha B’Ov” the Temple was burned.(27) “Honored mention must be rendered to the Jewish‘Beis-Olom’ or ‘Beis-Hakvuros’ as they called the consecratedground, the cemetery. Somehow it had come about that thecemetery just had to be located near the peak of a steep hill.Not enough that everyone shivered with fear from the varioustales told about the cemetery, from the peak there stared downthe isolated white tombstone of a deceased physician. Doctor Bick.68to recite several blessings, while the text is read by someonewho is better practiced in correctly reading the vowel-less Hebrewat sight. “Aliyahs” are honors, and ordinarily conferred on thelocal pillars of society; also on a thirteen year old on becoming“bar mitzvah,” and a bridegroom about to be married.(22) “Mishna:” the collection of rabbinical teachings, com¬posed immediately subsequent in time to the Holy Scriptures(roughly, from —200 to -}-200), which became the nucleus ofthe later Talmud. Pirke Avos is a part of the “Mishna,” but thereference here is an adaptation from the remarks of Rabbi Cha-nanyah ben Teradion in its Chapter 3. “L’Chayim” is the drink¬er’s toast “To life!’’(23) In summer time, the stoves would not be used at homeand therefore the “tsholent” had to be cooked at the baker’s.The most serious “tsholent’’-at-the-baker crisis happened onceat “Pesach,’’ Passover. In excessive concern not to have any“‘chometz’’ (non-Passover) food in the house, while not beginningto use the Passover food till the evening “seder,’’ it was customaryto skip the midday meal, or to restrict it to a neutral potato inborscht. When the first “seder” eve fell on Saturday night, therewas a problem. It is improper to fast on a Sabbath, and forbiddento cook. The solution was to deliver the “tsholent” pot on Fridayto the bakery, where the baker would seal the oven and pray tliatall would come out well. One one particular occasion when thehousewives came to collect their pots, as often, a disagreementarose over the identity of a particular pot. When it was un¬covered by way of determining the contents, an outcry arose thatit contained “kashe” (buckwheat groats), which was “chometz”and therefore everyone else’s “tsholent” was equally rendered“chometz.” Horrifying as this was to those who had not yet takentheir food home, it was infinitely worse as the word spread tothose who had, and had eaten “chometz” on Shabbos-Pesach-eve,a most fearful sin on their conscience. In this crisis appeal wasmade to the town rabbi who directed that a precise inquiry bemade into the contents of the suspect pot. It proved to be chickenand “kneidlach” (matzo meal balls). Notoriously the art ofmatzo balls is beyond many housewives, and in this case thematzo ball had disintegrated, giving the appearance of “kashe.”Once again Dobromil was saved (S.M.).(24) The Polish, or “large” church, was Roman Catholic.Dobromil also had a Greek Orthodox church serving the Ruth-67after the excitement. At two in the afternoon, the troops returnedfor their main meal of the day, at kitchens set up by the banksof the Wirwa near the swimming hole. At four in the afternoonthe army bands performed a public concert of military marchesin the Ring Platz. The only other public concerts in Dobromilwere trumpet solos by a police officer in the Ring Platz, usuallyin May.A “shabbos” afternoon pastime was to stroll after “tsholent”on the road to the railroad station, a pleasant walk. On one sideof the road there were level ploughed fields, while the othersloped uphill (S.M).(20) “Zemiros:” verses chanted or sung in celebration of theSabbath. Although Saul Miller’s later library in the United Statesincluded many volumes of Yiddish literature, in none of hismanuscripts about Dobromil is there any mention of MendeleMocher Sforim, I. L. Peretz, Sholem Aleichem, or any otherYiddish writer, nor of any Hebrew poetry other than of thesynagogue, reflecting the abysmal level of secular culture inthat community.“Tsholent:” food cooked in a stew-pot, a wide variety ofpossible concoctions. “Kugel:” a solid pudding, of potatoes, ornoodles, or other ingredients.(21) “Chevra:” any association, ranging from a formally or¬ganized congregation of a synagogue, to any amorphous groupassembled for a single event. Dobromil had “chevras” which werecooperative burial societies; free loan societies, lending moneywithout interest charges; groups collecting and dispensing chari¬table funds; groups for visiting the sick (“Chevra Linah”); in¬formal study circles, such as “Chevra Mishnayes,” studying the“Mishna,” “Chevra Misaskim,” studying the Torah; “ChevraCharitzim,” workingmen gathering to pray together; and others.“Aliyahs:” The Five Books of Moses, (the first five books ofthe Bible, constituting the Torah in the narrowest, technicalsense of that word, as distinguished from Torah encompassingthe whole of Jewish religious teaching) are divided into weeklyportions which are read, in succession, in a one year cycle, atsynagogue services, supplemented by selections from the laterbooks in the Hebrew Scriptures. These weekly portions are sub¬divided further into (usually) seven sections. At the synagogueservice, seven men, in turn, are ceremoniously summoned to goup (= “aKyah”) either to read one section aloud, or more often.66were several reasons why parents might keep children fromschool. One was religious: Catholic prayers were regularly recitedby the children in class, twice daily. Even if Jewish childrenwere not under compulsion (usually) to say these prayers, theysoon knew them by heart and willy-nilly were participating; tothem, sacrilege. Another reason was poverty: especially this wasin winter, when poorer children did not have the boots or coatsto wear.These truancies would receive the attention of the municipalpolice force, (which consisted of three or four men with very littleto do. They would once in a while proclaim a new ordinance tothe beat of a drum in the Ring Platz; conduct sanitary inspec¬tions; blow whistles in the alleys to help hunt for a stray dogor a missing sow; and on market Mondays, when the influx ofcountryside peasants created an opportunity for thievery, theywould disappear from sight. Most of the time they dozed).In enforcing the public school attendance regulations, theywould enter the cottage and seize either the wife’s Friday evening“Shabbos” candlesticks or the husband’s “shtreimel,” beingcertain that no greater hostage or bail bond was needed tocompel the father to respond before the Sabbath came. Some¬times a ten greitzer “tip” redeemed these essentials of the “Shab¬bos.” More often the “Yeed” would accept a one day detentionpenalty, agreeing to do his “sitting” from “Shabbos” midday tothe next morning, when he would not be at work anyway (S.M.).“Chad Gadya,” referring to the cell in the Magistrat, is anintentional joke here. It is actually the name of a folk song, around chanted at the end of the Passover evening “seder.”(19) There were Yiddish theatre performances in Przemysl, towhich some Dobromiler, including Saul Miller, went on occasion.Generally, in Dobromil, theatre was classed as “olom hazeh’digerhana’ah,” this-worldly-enjoyment, inconsistent with piety; even as“chilul ha’shem,” sacrilege.A major diversion each summer (“from Sivan into Tammuz,two weeks”) was the annual Austrian army maneuvers in thenearby mountains. The soldiers wore the same uniform, withdistinctive arm colors, light green for the Tenth regiment, darkgreen for the 9th, light red for the 7th. “Defending” forces worewhite banded caps, “attacking” no band. Army officers werequartered in the better quality homes, servicemen in barns. Dailybugle calls for reveille, and parades led by bands of martialmusic livened up the shtetl, with half-dressed toddlers running65‘‘The “Groise Shul" or Big Synagogue, used the Ashkenaziprayer-book, while the “Beis Medrash” used the Sephardi prayer-book. (These terms, Ashkenazi and Sephardi, did not mean inDobromil what they mean in Israel today.) The “MisaskimShilechel," Little Synagogue of the Study Group, conducted byReb Naftali Fuchs, met in part of the “Groise Shul,“ and the“Schneider Shilechel,” (“tailors” or workingmen’s synagogue)was some kind of offshoot of the Big Synagogue. The ChevraLinah Tsedek, the Society for Visiting the Sick, which was ledby Maier Treiber and Luzar Fabricant, used to hold services ina private house, lent by Leibish Brik. Maier Treiber seems tohave rotated among all of these.The “shtreimel” is a hat made out of fox tails arranged in acircle. A legendary figure in Dobromil was Reb Itzik’l Brief-trager, long time postman in the mid nineteenth century, soappointed because he could read all the local languages; hisdescendants were also noted for scholastic attainment, and evenin America have been referred to as “Itzik’l Brief-trager’s great-grand-children.” One Saturday night to catch up he worked allthrough till morning, when he emerged on Sunday to the streetstill wearing his “Shabbos shtreimel.” A group of Polish people,on way to church, saw him, were surprised at his “shtreimel” ona Sunday and called out, “Itzik, bei dir heint briss?”—are youcelebrating a circumcision feast today? That question became aDobromil proverb for any occasion when someone was unusuallydressed up.Apart from the established synagogues and chapels, on someoccasions Dobromil was visited by “mussar-zugger,” revivalistpreachers, who delivered their calls to repentance in sermons atthe Beis-Medrash in the time between “Mincha and Maariv.”Among the workingmen, wrote Saul Miller, they were littleheeded.Also on rare occasions, an itinerant “chazan” (cantor, chanterof the synagogue liturgy) stumbled into Dobromil and wasadmired and praised for his sweet melodies and inspiring in¬terpretation of the prayer-book; but then on Sunday volunteershad to beg donations to help cover his expenses. (S.M.)(18) Dobromil under Austrian rule had separate public schoolsfor boys and girls, roughly from age six to ten, four years. There64bookstore in Dobromil. Itinerant booksellers came from time totime with prayer books (“siddurim” for every day, “machzorim”for holidays) and occasionally a “maase-buch”, a Yiddish storybook for a greitzer (S.M.)(16) “Yomtov," pronounced “Yontif” in Yiddish, is a religiousholiday. To “daven" is to recite, or participate in the recital,of the set liturgy of psalms, piyyutim (pdst-Biblical religiouspoetry) and other ritual texts. Although these rituals for week¬days, Sabbaths, and holy days fill several volumes, observantJews by dint of constant repetition can often recite much, oreven most, from memory. I use “davenin” for the noun, “daven-ing" for the present participle. Pronounce the a in “daven" asin “art".(17) Tshortkover and Belzer: These were splinter quasi-sectsamong the many Chassidic quasi-sects, taking their names fromthe towns where their founding “rebbes" lived. Typically theymaintained separate synagogues; frowned upon intermarriagewith an adherent of the other Chassidic group; disputed overwhich “shochet" (meat and poultry slaughterer) was rituallyacceptable and whose meat was “kosher,” (a matter of businesseconomics as well as of religion) ; argued which Rabbi coulddecide a “Shaale” (a disputed question) with an authoritative“Tshuvah” (response with the effect of law) and which couldbetter bring influence to bear on the “Ribbono-shel-Olom,” theMaster-of-the-Universe. Although between them these two werenot a majority of the population, their factional hostility repeated¬ly divided the town, particularly when there was an electionof the two “Dayanim” (judges) or the “Moreh-Hora’ah” (ex¬pounders of rabbinical law, assistants to the rabbi). When therabbi at the main synagogue was of the Belzer persuasion (inSaul Miller’s time), Tshortkover Chassidim were uncooperativeand even mocking. In Dobromil there were also some followersof other “rebbes,” Sassover, Rumanover, etc.Maier Treiber was one of the many who stood aloof fromthese factions, as well as from the “misnagdim,” traditionalistswho actively opposed all the different Chassidim, who openlyscoffed at their “rebbes” and who criticized the needless emo¬tional and economic distress caused by their bickering.63(10) “Yahrzeit:” anniversary of someone's death, commemo¬rated by lighting memorial tapers in tumblers of about eightounces.(11) “Chometz” is leavened, ordinary bread, or any otherfood not prepared exclusively for Passover use. All traces of suchfood must be eliminated from the house before the “Pesach”(Passover) holiday begins, during which only unleavened bread(matzos) and similarly specially prepared foods may be used. Aholiday begins at evening time, “Erev” in Hebrew.“Nebich:" an interjection, meaning “it is a pity" (on him, onher, on them).(12) “Chaleh" is home-baked white bread for the Sabbath(“Shabbos"), often one domed loaf, and one “koiletsh," a braidedor twisted loaf.(13) “Melamdim" is the plural of “melamed," a teacher ofHebrew language and religious literature, usually teaching in hishome (“cheder”), paid privately for tuition; sometimes teachingin a community supported school.“Menachem-Mendl" is a folk character in Yiddish literature,a man without sure prospects, waiting for something to turn up,something like Micawber in Dickens’ David Copperfield. “^onkes”are small glass cups, about one ounce size, made to adhere to asick person’s chest or back by igniting alcohol vapor in themto create a vacuum. This was considered an infallible remedyfor pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. To my knowledge,it was still used in the United States into the 1930’s (L.M.)(14) “Bar mitzvah:’’ confirmation at thirteenth birthday whenthe boy becomes a man responsible before God for his ownconduct (until then, the responsibility of his parents). In thetwentieth century, and in the United States, this became anelaborate ceremonial followed by a family festivity. In someJewish circles, it has been extended by analogy into the develop¬ment of a “bat-mitzvah’’ ceremony for girls.(15) Naprzod, pronounced “Napshud,’’ means “Forward’’ inPolish: “Forward’’ was a favorite name for socialist-inclinedpapers. This was published by Dashinski. There was no news¬paper published in Dobromil. As Saul Miller indicates, theZionist paper was read by the youth of the “better off’’ families,“Naprzod’’ by the working youth. In those years there was no62''And lo came the day of that great Yontif. It was a Sundaymorning after ‘davenin of Shacharis’, (the morning service).Outdoors was wet wintry penetrating chill. Everyone was shiver¬ing blue with the cold. The heavens were enveloped in densegray cloud, and still drizzling a fine wet snow. Everybody wenttramping through the muddy snow sloughs to the bridge whichgoes to the Rinnies meadows, where on Rosh Hashanah wassaid ‘Tashlich’.“My father of blessed memory was there with Reb LuzarFabricant, with me between them, standing in the midst of allIsrael. Everyone’s eyes were somberly focused to the big sky.The snow let up, and with deep feeling all began to recitethe blessings from the booklets specially printed for ‘Kiddush-Ha-Chamah’. And the heavy dense gray clouds became thinnerand as through a veil just for a few seconds the sun came intoview. There was just enough time to say the ‘Brochos I’Chamah’,the Blessings for the Sun, and so the Dobromiler ‘Yeeden’ hadrenewed the sun. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief and gave thanksto the One Who Lives Eternally for the grace which had beenshown to us, verily, a miracle marvel from heaven.“For weeks afterward we ‘cheder’ boys kept talking about it,reassuring ourselves that we were young enough to be ableagain to join in another renewing of the sun” (S.M.)This particular occasion probably took place on Wednesday(not Sunday, despite Saul Miller’s recollection from sixty yearslater and not Adar, unless there was some thing very different inDobromil) the fifth of Nisan, 5657 by the Jewish calendar, April7, 1897. The event is supposed to commemorate the creation ofthe sun on Wednesday. The almanac calculator unknown toSaul Miller was Samuel Yarchina’ah, about 165-250, who aimedto set it at a particular position of Saturn in relation to thespring equinox, but it became formalized at the fifth of Nisan.It has been observed in the United States, although it is almostunknown. (L.M.)(9) “Mincha-Maariv:’’ religious services conducted every dayof the year, “Mincha“ just before sun down; “Maariv,” theoretical¬ly when the first stars appear, but in congregational worship,after sun-down, so that worshippers remain assembled for both.Pillar of cloud: as in the desert wanderings after the Exodusfrom Egypt.61Maier Treiber again carried him to the Rebbe, when the latter,about to leave town, was surrounded by people crowding for alast chance to see him. This time the Rebbe sent them awaybrusquely, saying “I took care of you already." Humiliated andembarrassed, Maier Treiber left, and never again approachedany Rebbe. A peasant acquaintance of grandfather Reeven theglazier heard, came to the house, and with the practical know-howof the countryside showed them how to treat the leg daily in hotwater baths and to bandage it properly. Two weeks later Saulwas out of bed. (S.M.)(8) Sanctification of the New Moon: a rite rarely practiced byJews in the United States. It is a recital of a liturgy at night outof doors. It seems to have been incorporated into Jewish traditionfrom practices customary in ancient prehistoric Canaan. (L.M.)Once in his childhood Saul Miller took part in a “Blessing ofthe Sun," “Birkas-HaChamah," a rite performed only once inevery twenty-eight years. “That devout Jews m*chadesh dee Vvunah(renew the moon) from long since, and do to this day, is nonews. We ‘cheder’ boys knew that at the beginning of eachmonth when in a clear night in the darkling sky there appearedthe new moon, Yeeden come out into the street after ‘Maarivdavenin’ and they m*chadesh dee Vvunah.“But that Yeeden m'chadesh the sun—that for us little ‘cheder'boys was big news, and that it comes about only one time intwenty-eight years, that was a truly great honor conferred on usboys, that we seven and eight year olds had lived to witnesssuch a celestial manifestation. We eavesdropped to the older mentalking among themselves by the warm stone stove in the BeisMedrash all about that phenomenon. Among ourselves we beganto fantasize and try to imagine in our conception how indeedthe New Sun would look when she would come out from hergreat winter wrappings in her full power and radiance.“I do not know how the author of that almanac came tocompute the renewing of the sun precisely for the month ofAdar and exactly in that time of bad weather to come andgreet such a most welcome guest who arrives only one time intwenty-eight years. Nu, no such questions will we now addressto that author, and if that almanac so indicates then most likelyit must be so. All the Yeeden in shtetl set themselves in readinessfor the great day as they would to a truly great Yontif. ‘Shteitsh,'(golly goodness gracious) such an event happening one time intwenty-eight years.60There ^Iso were sqine Polish and Ruthenian shopkeepers, handl¬ing non-kosher m^at, and other tradespeople. In 1900, there wereestimated 1,845 Jewish residents out of 3,309 total.(4) In the shtetl, life was ethnically hyper sensitive. The Jewishtownsfolk lived side by side with their non-Jewish neighbors inworlds apart. Yiddish terminology within the Jewish communityreflected this separation. Thus, in common conversation, “Yeed,”properly “a Jew," meant simply "a man." "Yeedena," properlya "Jewish woman," in common conversation meant only "awoman." "Yeeden," the plural, meant simply "people." (InSholem Aleichem's drama, "Hard to Be a Jew," a delegationis addressed by a rabbi with the greeting "Yeeden," meaning"Gentlemen.") To convey these complex senses, I use the Yiddishwords in this text. When Saul Miller used the word "Yehudim,"the formal Hebrew word for "Jews," with ironical purpose, theword is retained in the English, as here.(5) The stream was the Wirwa, (pronounced Virva) oftentorrential from rain or melting snow. The name means "rampag¬ing." Homes were frequently carried away in flood time. Onone occasion, Saul’s uncle Yusha was conveying a local tax officialby horse and wagon when flood waters swept them away, butthey were saved with the help of Yusha’s brother Hersh. Thestream also served for Tashlich, the Rosh Hashanah rite castingsins away into running water. (S.M.)(6) "Shabbos after kiddush:" when it was supposed to beespecially quiet. "Kiddush," a blessing said over the wine atsupper, begins the Sabbath at home. This street, its name pro¬nounced "Sheester Gass" in Galitzianer dialect, was the SkalkaUlitza. Saul Miller’s boyhood home was there, in a house belong¬ing to Pinchas Kramer, three doors from the beginning of thestreet, near Katz’s tavern.(7) As in the ninth plague in Egypt, Exodus 10:21. Thebroken leg was first treated by Dr. Brauner, the non-diploma’dJewish doctor, mentioned elsewhere herein, with not quitesatisfactory result. At that time the Sappover Rebbe was inDobromil, conducting what Americans would call "a revival,"and collecting handsomely. Friends urged Maier Treiber tocarry his boy Saul to the Rebbe, and reluctantly he agreed. TheRebbe put a red kerchief across the boy’s knee, blessed him, andsent him home. Nothing happened to the leg. Urged again.59Galitsia a» it was pronounced, rather than Galicia as is customary.In his Yiddish writings, Saul Miller often used Hebrew phrasesfor emphasis or for irony. These are herein indicated by italicsin the English translation. When they are from the Bible, thesource is given.Dobromil as a settled community may go back to the eleventhcentury, and its Jewish population likewise, although writtenrecords are available only from much later. In popular etymology,the residents said that its name derived from dobro, “good,”and mil, ^ “mile” because of the generous measurement of thearea when it was allocated in antiquity to a feudal lord; or, saidothers, as “good mill,” because of the availability of stream waterfor the mills refining the salt mined there. Grandfather Reuben(“Reeven”) Mehler said “Gall-itsia” was so called because lifethere was so bitter; others said it was because in the eighteenthcentury partition of Poland, the poorest part fell to the weakestpower, Austria.(2) Fires: Although it was Nazism and war which finally sealedthe doom of Dobromil, up to then it remembered mainly disasterby fire and by flood. Since many houses were roofed by dried outwooden shingles, and some by straw thatch, they were readytinder for sparks. Saul Miller witnessed one entire street aflameone July day, during the time he was in Reb Naftali Fuchs’cheder. People in adjacent streets rolled up their bedding, packedtheir movables and fled to open meadows. The column of smokewas seen by other villages and towns, which sent volunteers tohelp fight the flames.His mother often spoke of a great fire which had occurred“the first night of Slichos” (midnight prayer services during themonth before Rosh Hashanah, New Year’s). An historic firewhich leveled much of the town is recorded in the Yiskor Book.Dobromil’s volunteer firemen were ordinarily summoned by theMagistrat bell, but for really big fires the bell at the main churchwas tolled.(3) A greitzer was the smallest coin, more like a farthing thana penny; properly, kreuzer. Among the small shopkeepers weredealers in dry goods, notions, groceries, kosher meat, tobacco,leather and shoes, ready to wear men’s clothes, ladies’ wear,tinkers, watchmakers, hat makers, coopers, wood turners andcabinet makers, coal dealers. There were also “meckler,” middle¬men or brokers; “klezmer,” musicians available for weddings, etc.58Notes and AddendaThese notes and addenda by the present editor incorporatesupplementary information and reminiscences from other Yiddishmanuscripts written by Saul Miller on various occasions. Some ofthese details may seem trifling. However, they constitute sociologi¬cal and anthropological data which will never again be availableif not now recorded, and valid data is never trifling. Wheresignificant, “S.M." indicates material derived from other manu¬scripts of Saul Miller’s, and “L.M.” indicates matter supplied bythe editor. Matter which is “common knowledge” in Jewish circlesis not attributed.(1) Shtetl, (in Galitizia pronounced shtaytl; plural, pronouncedshtaytlach) is used in this translation, rather than “town,’' torefer to a specific type of settled community in an East Europeanregion, usually surrounded by a rural area and villages inhabitedby a majority of another nationality. By 1880 there were largeurban communities in many cities, Odessa, Vilna, Warsaw, Vien¬na, Berlin, and many others, which were much less ingrovn inoutlook, quite cosmopolitan in culture; but somewhat as ruralAmerica has long colored the civilization of big-city industrialUnited States, so the shtetl dominated the image of East EuropeanJewish life for centuries, until its annihilation in the Hitlerianholocaust of 1939-1945.Pronunciation: in Hebrew and Yiddish words herein, ch alwaysrepresents the guttural sound of clearing the throat, as in cheder,churban, cherem, Chanukah. The sound of ish, the combinitionof the Yiddish letters tess-shin, is always so spelled here: tshdent,koiletsh. The last letter of the Hebrew alphabet is here transli¬terated as s whenever it was so pronounced in Dobromil («>: sas in Beis, not th as in Beth, and not t as in current Israeliusage).Dobromil is pronounced as if it were composed of the threeEnglish words dub-roe-meal, accent on the first syllable. I spell57PostscriptSaul Miller stayed about two years in Berlin, and came toNew York about 1909. Evenings he attended the well-knownEron Preparatory School on the East Side, mastering En¬glish, learning algebra, ancient and modern history, read¬ing Shakespeare, Longfellow, Tennyson, as well as (inGerman) Goethe, Schiller and Heine. He was a garmentworker all his life. As an active member of Local 9 of theInternational Ladies Garment Workers Union, he becamea top officer in the 1920’s, always self-sacrificing in theinterests of the workers who elected him. When factionalismsplit the union, he resigned office, feeling it was impossibleto play a principled role. Later, when unity was restored,he was again a union leader, and served as field organizerfor the ILGWU in Minneapolis, Kansas City, Baltimoreand elsewhere during the years of the Committee for In¬dustrial Organization (1937-1938).After World War II he was a one-man committee ofcorrespondence, seeking out all the surviving refugees ofthe Dobromil area, helping them to find new homes. Fora time, when it seemed possible to re-establish such centers,he organized the collection of books for libraries in Poland.His life and his struggles were shared by his wife, Ida(c. 1890-1958), daughter of Eliezer Loewenthal and TobaArgand, a descendant of Itzik'l Brief-trager.He has always been a staunch spokesman for the rights ofall peoples, a militant defender of the well-being of theworking-class, a preacher for peace, always associated withthose who were consistently principled in struggle for theliberation of humanity. To his children and grand-childrenhe has always conveyed the Vision enshrined in the firsttwo chapters of Isaiah.56service. So do I, but 1 admit and confess that “Mincha"and “Maariv” were not on my mind, and my bread andcheese I did not even taste. We approach the border cross¬ing, Mislewicz. “Here,” says my kinsman, “we have to movefast.” So we go down to the station, our packages are in¬spected. Rushing, we are soon seated on the other side.Now, says my kinsman, we are on German territory. I lookat him. “German” I understand, but not “territory.” Heobviously understood my questioning look and explained,“German soil.”We make ourselves comfortable, put our packages up onthe shelf. This car also gets jammed, enough to make youfeel faint. This is a third class carriage, my kinsman ex¬plains, where people are packed like cattle.We have been riding perhaps half an hour, when aGerman railroad officer comes in and cries “All travelpasses ready.” I take out my workbook on which is writtenthe few words authorizing my travel to Germany. Thepoliceman takes my book, looks at me, looks at the book.I feel my soul leaving my body: they can be “meshuga”(wacky) and send me back whence I came in custody ofa guard. Finally I heard his voice coming through to me,“You have people expecting you?” In a tremulous voice Ianswered “Thank you very much.” That minute felt aslong as the duration of the Jewish Diaspora. My kinsmancame through easily. He simply showed a tax receipt show¬ing that he was a resident of Berlin, with permission totravel.So we ride through Germany all during the long night.I sit at the window, not sleeping a minute, just staring intothe distant depths of the night. Here and there someflickering lamps flew past, some cottages, till day began todawn. The train began to stop at every station, until aboutnine in the morning we pulled into Alexanderplatz stationin Berlin. Dobromil was already far away. What will be?55myself know not where. She began again, “Young man, whyso sad?” Her words were like a needle to a blown upballoon ready to burst. I feel that I cannot control myselfany longer and a torrent of tears fall down my cheeks. Likea mother she takes out her pocket, handkerchief and wipesaway my tears as I tell her that I have just taken final leaveof my beloved father and mother, who knows if ever to seethem again. This strange dear woman comforts me, andsays to me “Don’t be so troubled, you will surely make outwell.” And so the time passed, and we are already at thePrzemysl railroad station, and saying goodbye.Just as I enter the terminal building, to change trains,and there came Haman, there approaches a man with a tinbadge on his cloak and tells me to open my package. I stopshort, not understanding what he can find on me. I lookat him, questioningly, as if to say why should I open mypackage. He yells out at me, “Why are you standing therelike a dummy, open your package!” And before I can openit, “Aha!” He already has the package spread out and hehas seized the flask of brandy. He was a revenue inspectoron guard against the import of liquor from other places.Nu, he had caught me in the act with my great crime,and announces “I think I will run you in.” Meanwhilethere arrived my kinsman from Chirov, with whom I wasto go to Berlin. He speaks to the inspector, “Well, youreally are one terrific guardian of the law. Just see whatyou found on the boy, a sixteenth of brandy, enough tocover a man's tooth. You have yours already, let the kid go,he’s traveling with me and we have to board the train.”So with a little more hassle, my kinsman was able to bidhim adieu, slipping him a coin in the hand, and we arealready going into the railroad car, which we nearly missed.We had no seats for three or four hours, almost to Cracow.At Cracow the train stopped for fifteen minutes and wewent off for a breath of air. The car was jammed withpeople and the air foul to breathe. We hear the whistleand hurry back to the train. Now there was more room.We took seats. It is beginning to get dark, “Mincha-Maariv”time. My kinsman stands up and “davens” the “Mincha”54broken up. She saw, prophetically, that I was lost to her.Father having been a traveling salesman from his youngyears was not so much upset.(There was another reason. My mother had gone throughchildbirth about twelve times in her life. The first bornboy, Abraham, took strong fright at the sight of this worldand decided to flee hence when yet a little lad, all in allfour years old. A second boy did not even want to stick itout a month, and right after his circumcision went oft tothe other world. Only four of us grew up. I took the placeof the oldest; there was my sister Zlata, my brother Hersheleand a sister Liebe Reisei, who was called Liebele, who wasreally a beauty. The other six infants did not even want totake a look at this world, not even to open one eye. Motherbecame invalided and was unable to bear live children.When I was about fourteen or fifteen, and was working ona job, late one night my father knocked at my boss’s windowand wakes me, “Shoyl, get up, Mama is very sick.” I thenalready understood what that meant and I spoke up toFather, not embarrassed to face him, ‘'How long will this goon?^^ My boss’s wife, Sara, went with us to see what couldbe done until the doctor came.)Yes, we are all three riding in one wagon, and all keepingvery silent. Only the whistle of the wind, the clip clop ofthe horses, the cracking of whip and the “vee-oh” of UncleMaier to the horse were heard. We come in good order tothe station. I lift off my package of supplies for the trip,which included two sets of underwear, my “tefillin,” twoshirts, an extra “leib-tzu-dekel,” a little soft white cheese,with two pieces of bread, a little flask of brandy and a goodpiece of cake. The train shuffles in. I take leave of myfather. His final words to me—“Look now, don’t forget the‘davenin’,”—for him the greatest worry.I take my seat on the train, in a very depressed mood.There in Dobromil was no remaining; there where I go,what awaits me? A strange country, a strange language. Ifeel the tears welling up. I could really have cried plenty.Near me sits an older woman who sees my mood, andspeak to me. I hear nothing. My thoughts are far away. I53away from her, and she would never see me again. Icomfort her: she will get a letter every week. When I amearning money, she will not be forgotten. She took herhands away from her face ^nd with a sigh from the heart,she said. Done, tomorrow we go for a passport.Next day at half past nine in the morning we go to theclerk of passports. We are told he is not in, away onvacation. We have to apply to the Poborcia himself. Motherdoes not hesitate, asks for his office and knocks at his .door.The exalted lord opens the door and asks, in Polish, whatdo you want. Mother seizes his hand and kisses it in thefashion of those times, and she proceeds to spin out a yarnof complaints before that' person about how terrible life iswith my father. She says such things about Father thatI cannot understand, how can she say such things whichare not so at all, plain scandalous words, and with tears tomove a stone. The Lord interrupts: “aha, he wants to goto America." Mother swears by all that is holy that Igo only to Berlin to find employment. “And he will have toreport for military service to the Austrian consulate inBerlin." Mother agrees, of course he will report for militaryservice. “Have you a workbook?" he asks me. Yes, I takeit out of my pocket and place it on the table. “Come backin about two days, you will get the passport, but only up toyour time for military service."We go out into the street, mother and I, and I say,“Mama, how did you dare to say such things about Dad?"“Kind meins, my child, if I had not made it such a tragedy,you would never get the passport."Two days later, Friday, I went back up to the exaltedLord and an aide gave me my workbook with the permis¬sion to go to Germany inscribed. That summer, beforeleaving Dobromil, I enjoyed my aunt ZeesePs wedding andfirst after the autumn holidays Reb Chayim and I took ourdeparture.We are riding to the railroad station: my father, myself,my uncle Maier Kramer who is driving the horse and wagon.(He was husband of my grand-father Reuben's sister Baila-Perl). My mother did not go to the station. She was all52sight. He had two daughters of marriageable age. He talkedthings over with my father and was willing to take meback to Berlin with him; but he wanted to meet me first.My shoes were at the repair shop. No other pair did Ihave. Father sympathizes with my dilemma, pulls off hisown boots. I look at them. They are really too big formy feet but I pull them on, wash up, comb my hair andtake off on foot to yonder shtetl. It cost only fifteen greitzerby train, but I would not indulge myself those fifteengreitzer. It was a fine day. I hike to Chirov. I arrive, ammet at the door by the older daughter, about twenty-twoor three, greeted with a smile and led into the cottage.Reb Chayim, a handsome “Yeed" with a fair face, a silver-streaked black beard, yarmulka on his head, sits over arabbinical book. As I approached the table, he rose, gaveme a warm handshake, and with smiling face offered me acordial “Sholom Aleichem” (how do you do). He calledChaye, his wife, “Look, look, this is Maier’s son. He wantsto go to Berlin. Certainly I will take him along. He is askilled worker, will soon make good money. But tell me,how much have you?” I tell him, something like thirty gul¬den. “Enough for now,” he says. “And a passport?” No.“You think you can get a passport, because you must haveone to cross the frontier into Germany?”Again I get cold all over. I am afraid, for two reasons.At that time all young men liable to military draft wereheld back. Second, there were good people around whoonly intended doing you a good turn, such as tipping offthe government agencies, so that one was already cookedand well done, with no possibility of emigrating anymore.I took a pleasant leave of Reb Chayim, his wife anddaughters and took the road back to Dobromil.On the way back, all kinds of thoughts rush through myhead. How to get a passport issued by the Poborcia.®^ Heis actually not unfriendly to Jews, but my appearance itselfwould betray me. So I come home, talk things over withMother. She covers her face with her hands, not to showher tears. She understood intuitively that I was being torn51lifted not the canopy but my heels. I never entered thatcottage again nor returned to that job. The mistress ofthe house came to check up on what had happened. Plainlyand flatly I let her know that I engage in no brokeredmarriage and would surely find my traveling expenseswhen I would need them.Meanwhile in those seasons when there were no marketfairs, my mother used to take orders to sew up cheap readymade men’s trousers for six greitzer a pair, bringing thematerial from the store, sewing them up, pressed anddelivered back to the store. Going around idle was nocareer for me, so willy-nilly I sat down to one of our twosewing machines and for three greitzer a pair sewed uptrousers, three greitzer properly belonging to my motherfor thread she bought, for cutting the cloth, pressing anddelivering.At that time there came to town an ex-Dobromiler visit¬ing from America. Mother invited him to our home, aninvitation he gladly accepted, there not being many attrac¬tions in Dobromil. And so he did come, this guest, andfinds me sewing these trousers. He expressed astonishment,and said to Mother, “Roise, in America he would lack fornothing. He is already a qualified worker, a pants operator.‘Ein kleinigkeit’ (my goodness!), a pants operator,” herepeated to make sure that Mother heard what he said.I, however, was hot and cold, hot because he touched onmy wishes, and cold because my whole fortune was mythirty Austrian gulden, barely enough to reach the borderof Austria, never enough for ship’s passage.“The Master-of-the-Universe does not abandon us.”Happens such a matter. Not far from Dobromil there existsanother such creation, a shtetl half the size of Dobromil,named Chirov, and there my father had a kinsman namedChayim. Chayim used to come home each “Pesach” to hiswife and children from Germany where he was a peddlerin the suburbs of Berlin. Father also had kinfolk in Berlinwho started as peddlers and worked up to be manufacturersand also big egg dealers. Reb Chayim even in Germany worenot only beard but also “payos,” although tucked out of50VIIII Leave DobromilThe previous chapter ends with the words, I leaveDobromil. But that was easier said than done.When I left the tailor shop where I had suffered allthose years, there first began a new series of "tzuros ’(troubles). There was no employer where I could findwork. All the masters were ready-to-wear tailors and infour and a half years as apprentice I had barely beentaught to make a good pair of pants for the deputy-mayor:the place where I worked was the one firm who made hisclothes. Again having no choice, I took the bull by thehorns and applied to another tailor who happened to havesome odd job orders for “Shevuos.” This boss was calledthe Austrian tailor, a “Yeed" with a long and broad un¬kempt beard which he stroked scholar-fashion. He wasshort in stature but roly-poly with a substantial pot-bellyover which he draped his beard to hide his belly, becausesuch a belly and such a beard were not befitting a tailor.His wife was the exact opposite, small and skinny, witha pitted face probably from a childhood pox, and with avery shrill voice. Their treasure was an only daughterwho had very bad painful eyes as a result of complicationsfrom childhood measles. All this I discovered promptlythe first day. And chatting over the work they found outthat America was in my mind but traveling expenses werelacking in my pocket. Nu, they had a ready made plan allworked out. They were ready to give me all the expensesfor going to America on the one condition that I join withtheir daughter under the bridal canopy. So I unhesitatingly49their meetings was in a barn.^^ In my seventeenth year Ileft Dobromil for Berlin in Germany and never set eyeson Dobromil again.48.9.iMrl»eU§l»ud| ^KHi^^ka robotulcza ^KHHscKa ^poCiTHMHa^f”; .HlUi i HMBBCKO : JJeburtaort; 1Miejice urodeeuia; ^ ..liiorri^e ypoAMeu:Qkburtdia^r:urodzeaia :PiK 7poa»«m:focimatigcmeinbe (poUtijcbcr »ciir!):Gmina priynalelaosci (Powiat polityczny);rpoMBA* npuuLaeaKMOCTH (IloAHTH'uiKJt noBir)^anb (ob Ublg ober t)er^(iraUt): 'SUn (wolny lub ionaty):^Kaundl ado BaaceHaTmH:1.Mail ..8auT«: J^totur: Wiroit: Pier: ^9efi4^t: Twan; «Sai;e:^are: W/oiy: Bo.ioca«; •ttugen: Ooiy: Obb;Stunb: DiU: yora:9{a|e: Not: Hio:Befonbtre ftennjeu^en:8»ozeg6^ow0 znaJ^^'-<Oooieni npuaii^ ^1..9{atiKnA|eTtig|W^aanorfczajj’“‘“XmiM’^rtiguug ber auif^niaaj:iuu<Pf^ \rodpit iry8tamaj%o«j awierzchnoioi gwnoej: >Qij^uio 7paA7 rpana^CKoro: 1Pieoz^dnam»The first apprentice workbook, May, 1903 with signature ofDr. Zwicklitzer, Mayor47I understood my bitter plight, took my kinsman’s counseland turned back to town, wiped my Jips, went back to thetailor’s. Although the master’s wife called me to eat, I didnot go to the table. Who could eat at such a time? Butriding in the coach I had decided one thing: once for allI must recover my workbook. And so it actually cameabout. I bided my time until a summer evening when nowork was being done, but I casually arranged to havesome overtime work. All the household were away “daven-ing Mincha-Maariv,” and the mistress of the house was inthe street. I knew where the workbook was kept. One, two,three, the workbook lies in my shirtfront. I rushed throughmy overtime work, slipped home to my parents, and hid theworkbook in a cradle in the woodshed. But that was all fornothing. My bosses noticed that the booklet was missing,asked me if I knew where it was, which I naturally dis¬claimed. That face-slapping boss then applied to themunicipal recorder and obtained a second workbook, whichI still have with me to this day.At the end of the six months in which I had to work offall the Sabbaths, holy days and days of illness, I had toanew indenture myself for one year, because there was noother tailor-employer available in Dobromil except inready-to-wear, and for this I was not considered trained.I had no choice. At this time they would offer me no morethan twenty-five gulden for the year, besides meals, andI was unwilling to remain with them. The old boss’s wifecame after me and said “I will give you five gulden morefrom my money, so stay for the year.” So I remained ayear for meals and the thirty gulden promised me. Laterfrom America I sent the “balabusta” back five dollars forthose five gulden. And so I wound up my apprenticeyears as a garment worker.At that time I already used to glance into the Polishnewspaper “Naprzod” edited by the Social Democrat namedDashinsky. I had already begun to listen to accounts of aMay Day celebration in Przemysl. At sixteen or younger Iwas already traipsing after Social Democratic candidateswho came to Dobromil. The only place they could hold46cut up the facings of the jacket ordered by the TownRecorder, no more and no less." Everything swam in frontof my eyes and I passed out. Some one doused me witha bucket of cold water. I come to. It is already dark. Idress, go to "daven," go home, that is to say, to the tailor’stable. No one looks at me, while I go through the "kid-dush" (ritual blessing of the wine) as if the greatestcalamity ("chalilah") has befallen me. I try to eat butevery morsel gags me. I see the looks I get, looks to kill, toannihilate, to efface.^^ There is a hush over the house asif the most awful wrath of God had been invoked uponthem all. And nonetheless they would be able to obtain thesame material, and indeed they did buy it. And I also paidfor the damage, but yet I was not finished. Sunday morningI rise up, sit down to my work. One of the two brothers,the one who considered himself as more enlightened, glaredat me with his eyes without saying a word and handed mea gift of his fist into my face so that I fell off my stoolwith the blood pouring from my nose. The second brothermumbled something but I no longer heard anything. Ipicked myself up, rinsed off my bloodied face, took my"tefillin" bag and fled, not caring to wait for anything elseand so ran off to the synagogue to "daven." O did I "daven"that day, full of arguing complaints to the Master-of-the-Universe, and definitely on the spot resolved to wind upthe situation. I took off the "tefillin," put them in the bag,and took the road to the railroad station. There were linedup the coachmen, one of whom was a kinsman of mine,rather an intelligent fellow (He is here in America now,if still alive, in Brownsville, Brooklyn), and he spoke tome in this manner of language, "Shoyl-brother, you are notsome kind of a dope. Where will you go? You have nomoney, you have no workbook. Even if you reach someplace on foot, the police will bring you back. Listen tome, come sit up here in my fiacre, make believe that nothinghas happened, go back until the time when you will belegally free and then you can go travel wherever you willwish."45all her cooking. And now are you anxious to know whereI slept? On the topmost outer level of the oven, with aclosed window through which I could see when it wasdawn. Fridays I had no need to look. The “balabusta”would rise early to bake “chaleh,” and when she fired upthe oven, what do you think? My mattress was a sackstuffed with husks of groats which heated up fast. Andsmall wild life, both brown and white, were also not lack¬ing. So to get away alive I had to meekly (“bimchilah”)creep down and so anyway set down to work, even whenit had been two in the morning when I had crept up thechimney to sleep. This house was so overrun with (un¬mentionables) that my own parents would not let me stayover a night to sleep with them. Once each week I wouldgo to the sweat-bath and hang my underwear up tofumigate them a bit.Nu, how does it strike you, to persevere through threesuch years? One had to be of iron. By the time I hadfinished out my three years, the older boss was already inthe world-to-come and the younger bosses (who had attimes looked into the “Naprzod,”) taught me a properaccounting. For having been sick sometimes, for the Sab¬baths and Holy Days and for several occasions when Ifled from them when I could no longer endure their tor¬ments, they added a bill of debts with a total balance ofsix months to work off. And I was compelled to workthem off.Yes, something had happened. I was already able tomake a little vest also. One Friday I was finishing a vestand they had not given me any facings. I had to scroungeup scraps for facings. If it is someone’s destiny to have“tzuros,” don’t ask, they come to hand. I went over towhere some odds and ends, tiny scraps were lying andthe Evil Impeller (“Yetzer Ha-Ra”) slipped what I neededright into my hand. I finish my piece of work, with greatpride hang it up, polish everyone’s shoes and go to thesweat-bath. It was already twilight. Comes my boss’s soninto the sweat-bath, hunts me down, and says, “Shoyl, Idon’t know how to help you, but I have to tell you, you44imposed on apprentices was to go on miscellaneous er¬rands. It was usual to plug every hole with me. Althoughthey had a boy of their own, I was the servant. Yet oneother sphere of work was assigned to the learning ap¬prentice, carrying out the family “potty” every morning,and Friday afternoon polish the shoes and boots for thewhole household. This lasted almost through the wholetime of my learning apprenticeship. The one chore whichI did like was to deliver the finished garments, becausesometimes I got a few greitzer as a tip, but in this I alsohad a partner, the boss’s son. As it happened, he was a goodfellow and used to act friendly to me.I almost forgot. In Dobromil every employee had toobtain from city hall a workbook and give it to his boss.Without a proper transfer no second employer would hirea man, and without it no worker could make a move. Ihad turned such a workbook over to my boss and thatmeant, brother, no matter how tough things might be, youmust take it and say nothing. Not once only did I cursethe day I was born for the insults which I had to swallow,and this was without being given any meals. You canimagine how it was after the first year and a half when Ihad to eat there too and perforce sleep there also. By thenI knew enough already to sew up a pair of cotton trousers,a pair of “long John” underwear pants (white “gatkes”)and a “leib-tzu-dekel.”By rights this meant that I was earning my keep, mymeals. I used to take my meals in a corner under the greatstove, so that the boss should not see. But if he would noticethat I was not at the sewing machine, he would peer intomy corner and make a sarcastic remark, “To eat unfor¬tunately no one is at hand, but to do his job, ay, ay,”meaning the opposite.Sleeping in. The room was about six to eight meterslong, three meters wide. This was the workroom where fiveand sometimes six workers were employed. This was alsothe bedroom where six to eight people slept. This was alsothe dining room. Here too was that bake oven where the“balabusta” (boss’s wife) baked bread and “chaleh” and did43VIIMore Apprentice YearsAnd now another installment of tailor’s tribulationswhich I endured in Dobromil. As you recall for all of twoyears I was tormented at the ready-to-wear tailor’s andlearned almost nothing except to lug the loads of uncutcloth from the cloth dealer or the finished cloaks to thestore who sold to the peasants. Now I had decided thatthis was no way for me. I must learn to be a proper crafts¬man. I talked things over with Dad and Mom and theyacceded to my justified complaints. Father took the missionon himself and went to speak to that same tailor by whomI had a very fine black spring coat made to order. In“Chol-hamoed Pesach” (the middle days of Passover week)he indentured me for three years, a year and a half to eatat my home, and the second year and a half to eat at thetailor’s. They were a father and son partnership, as itstands in the Scripture verse, a schneider ben schneider,a tailor son of a tailor. My new boss had never taken anapprentice before. To my miserable luck, he agreed andbade me come in after “yomtov” to start learning.^^Three years, heavy-laden years. First thing my boss didnot like was the way I held my fingers bent with thethimble on the middle finger of the right hand. So hetied up my finger for four weeks time till I could notstraighten it out again and yea verily even unto this selfsameday I have that finger bent as if I were always ready to pusha needle. Second, it was my chore to thread needles for theboss, since he was an old man and could not see to threada needle fast. So I stood and did that for him. A third task42shtetl of Dobromil got off with only a few blows and alittle fright. The fright continued for quite some time.We anticipated an organized pogrom on the part of thepeasant folk. From that Monday on the town authoritiesused to send in the gendarmerie every Monday, with gunsand swords, to guard against any attack on Dobromil, andso thereafter none such took place.41stands, each with their produce, both raw and finished. Thepeasant folk streamed into town with their horses andwagons, their hogs, their cows and calves, hens, ducks,geese. The weekly market was under way, with its appro¬priate screaming and tumult, like all weekly market days.“Yeeden” were calling out with hoarse voices, each callingcustomers to his stall, announcing that he has the bestwares. So they did some selling, took in a little cash, andpresently it was tending to the end of the day. The peasant¬ry were packing up their purchases, to ride home.One peasant couple came over to a Jewish girl to buysome fruit, apples. We had the custom of the baker's dozen:with every purchase the customer got a “pshetschinik,”(Polish: przyczynek) an extra fruit. Otherwise it was nobargain. The girl had already added the extra to thepurchase, in this instance, but then it was when it allhappened. The peasant woman took one more extra apple.The girl, not using the best judgment, tried to snatch thisapple back, and accidentally caught her fingers in thewoman's string of beads, which scattered to the ground.A hullabaloo broke out. The peasant grabbed the girl bythe hair with such violence that he pulled out tresses,scalp, skin, and all. A riot followed between peasants and“Yeeden." Our uncle Hersh, may his memory be blessed,was then in the prime of young manhood and he swung intoaction with the leg of a stool, and he also did not kidhimself, he collected his own quota of blows. Whoeverwas there both gave and got, each his share, until thepolice arrived. The peasantry simply took to their heelsand fled homeward. Only the “Yeeden," being local townresidents, remained. So the police filed an indictment andsummoned the “Yeeden" into court on charges. A numberwere subjected to punishment (detention) for causing dis¬order in town and giving the town a bad name. Othersgot off with money fines. Many were simply discharged.The Jewish girl who suffered the most, in pain and inshame, till her head and hair healed up, sold no moreapples for a long time, trembling in fear lest somethingshould again happen because of her. And so the Jewish40yourself the “Shir Ha-maalos“ song and dance that masterof mine gave me.^^Another thing that happened to me. The pressing ironsused to be heated over a coal fire, and we needed liveburning coals to ignite the hard coal. So the master sendsme to the baker’s to fetch a few hot coals. As I go outsidea fierce wind whips up sparks and live burning embersare sent flying over the alley. The neighbors see and beginto scream. Then I was really frightened, try to open thepressing iron to shake the coals into the gutter, whereuponthe wind first really began to scatter the sparks. The neigh¬bors chased after me wanting to kill me for trying to setthe town on fire. Finally the few embers burned themselvesout and I was rescued from death.Since too much I was not learning of the trade, I resolvedthat if I was to become a decent craftsman, I must go tolearn from a custom tailor. It was just before that Passoverthat I earned some money at baking matzos, and savedup for a spring topcoat, made at a custom tailor’s. So Iindentured myself there for three whole years.That will take a bit of telling, and here I want to digressto recount an episode from which a major catastrophe mighthave developed for the Jews of Dobromil. As you recall,the Jews of Dobromil as in other Galitsianer shtetls ekedout their living by “luft parnossas,’’ (making a living fromthe air). In all of these “parnossas,” the women had tohelp in order to have a a piece of bread. I once learned anitem of Oral Torah Tradition that in Jewish legend it istold how it was because of a hen and a rooster that theHoly Temple went up in flames. Here in Dobromil asimilar fate might have come about over a little apple.In Dobromil there was a little space, half a square,where women used to sit by their fruit stands. Very fewpeople understood buying fruit by the pound. They simplydidn’t have enough money, or they did not indulge them¬selves to buy several pounds of apples or other fruit, unlessthe fruit was already half rotten, although the whole regionwas flooded with fruit orchards. One ordinary fine Mondaymorning “Yeeden” and “Yeedenas” busily set up their39by a hanclsome barrage of blows by peasant staffs on myhead. I barely escaped to my father’s stall and about eleveno’clock reached home again. That “Shabbos” at the “daven-in,” I “bentshed goimel,” offered up thanks for my deliver¬ance from that peril: so I was advised by the older folks,to help me banish my terror.As I began to relate earlier, I was entrusted to a tailor,Itzik Schneider, a ready-to-wear tailor, actually kinfolk, thehusband of my mother’s aunt, sister to my grandmother.They treated me worse than if I had been a total stranger.Two years I worked with this family. Itzik was not in¬terested in teaching me the trade. I received no pay, onlyoccasionally Friday after the sweat-bath he would give thejourneymen a spot of brandy with half of a fresh bakedroll, so I would get that too.I used to have to go on foot delivering the ready mademerchandise to the dealer, bring the loads of unfinishedwool cloth from that store to be worked up into men’smantles and coats. Here I want to tell of three events.Once on a very bitterly cold day they sent me to bringthe raw materials. Nu, much choice I had. Warm gloves—I had none. Out of doors it was about eighteen degrees be¬low zero. By the time I had gone half way I felt as if thenails would spring off my fingers. What to do? The snow isdeep. There is no place to sit down to warm my hands.I shift the load from shoulder to shoulder. Half frozen Ibarely made it back to the cottage. It took a bit of time tillI could thaw out my hands. For this all that I earned wasthe pickings of the cotton padding waste which they usedin the peasant cloaks. All week I collected this and sold it tothe hatmaker for two greitzer.A second incident. On a winter night, slippery wet, sodark you could grasp the gloom in your hands, my boss,the “relative,” takes five finished cloaks, with light coloredlinings, piles them on my shoulders, not tied together. Igo out half a block and crash, I slip and fall with theselight lined mantles into the muddy slush. Nu, I just aboutmade it back with the coats. “Meila,” you can figure for38VIApprentice YearsI went as apprentice to become a tailor. This does notmean that I was not already earlier sewing on a machinewith my mother from nine years on, helping sew peasantchildren's dresses and aprons, and from time to time alsohelping sell the finished goods to the peasants. Once, inAugust 1899, one “Shabbos" night after “Havdallah" weboth sat down to two machines (we had two Singer foottreadle machines) and finished two dozen little dresses andaprons. About two o’clock in the morning Mother escortedme out of the house with the pack of finished merchandiseand sent me off to my father, a mountain walk of three anda half European miles. I arrived at the place of the marketfair, (called the Calvary, a place where religious proces¬sions were held) when it was already broad daylight. Iasked my father what time it was and he answered “sixo'clock.” First thing Father led me into the kretschma(tavern), first to “daven,” and then to feed me breakfast.Then my uncle Yusha conferred on me the honor ofstanding in charge of a keg of cider. Meanwhile therearrived a peasant procession bearing an image of the VirginMary, an elegantly decorated statue on a red velvet litter.I am standing crying out “Cold drinks, cold drinks,” ob¬livious that it was an improper time, so a hefty peasant sethis boot on the faucet of the keg and the drink began torun out. I bend down to close it and someone hoisted mycap with a stick and there I remain standing without a hat,bareheaded just when they carried by the Virgin Mary andall their crucifixes and their other sanctities, accompanied37but less murderously. I, however, achieved my own wellearned verdict of the court: I was kept back another yearin the same grade. By law each one had to pass four elemen¬tary grades from age six to ten. I was forced to stay on tilleleven, and so I finished both public elementary school and“cheder,” and then went out to learn a trade. That is, ateleven I went as apprentice to become a tailor.®^36guage, Ruthenian, the “regional” language, and German,because we then belonged to Austria, whose subjects wewere. Here we had a very strict teacher, an outright Jew-hater. For any triviality he would beat the Jewish childrenalmost to death. He used a rod which whistled when hewielded it through the air. He would make the boy liedown on a bench, pull his breeches tight, and so floghis rear that the boy would practically fall in a faint, unableto stand up to return to his place. Sitting again was im¬possible. This teacher’s neck veins would be filled withmurderous blood almost to bursting. Jewish children usedto wear velvet “yarmulkas” covering their heads. If (“cha-lilah”) he would find trace of a feather on someone’s“yarmulka,” he would lift the “yarmulka” on his rod andcarry it around among the non-Jewish boys making verynasty remarks.We Jewish boys were required to standevery morning while the Christian boys said their “mod-litva” (prayer). Standing and hearing their prayer everymorning, we soon learned to recite it better than anyof them. This took place twice a day, mornings and atdismissal time.Coming from a home of devout parents, this was notmuch to my liking. I protested once, but the teacherignored my protest and ordered us to participate every day.This time I told my father, who took the issue up withReb Yankel Shtein, the one Jewish man in Dobromil whowore a fur turban. Not everyone was permitted to wearsuch a hat, only one who was a “Talmid Chacham,” ahighly educated person. He also wore the silk cloak everyday of the week, and a “tallis-katan” with the four fringe“tzitzis” dangling from the four corners. Next day as weJewish boys assembled before class-time, we saw venerableReb Yankel Shtein with his cane arriving at the school. Weentered, each to our places, and our teacher was white aschalk, rage seething in him, because the Director had beentold how he had been treating the Jewish children. Firstof all Reb Yankele had obtained that we did not have torise for the recital of their “patchas” (pacierz, prayer),and treatment was milder. The teacher could still whip.35called Kriftsch. Here I was supposed to start studying“Gemara” (the Talmud).No sooner had I entered the room, the whole affair dis¬pleased me. This “melamed” shared his dwelling, in abedroom with a closed window, with an unpleasant odor,where an invalid boy lay on a cot, continually spitting atthe wall. I felt as if I would throw up. All in all we werethree pupils. However, it was the season for changingdwellings, and this “Rebbe” did change his place to one abit better. Here he did take in a larger number of pupils.He used to reserve me for Thursdays. That is, since Iused to know the portion of the week (“sedra”) by heart,I used to stay only to scan over the “Chumash.” Alongsideof me there was a fellow from the “Belzer Kloiz” with whomtlie melamed used to work hard especially on “Gemara.”^^One day he said to me, “Shaul, this Friday evening I amgoing to have you recite for Reb Itschele Mehler” (fatherof this Belzer fellow). During the week it happened that heoffended and embarrassed me in front of the other pupils.If he had beat me it would perhaps not have hurt me asmuch. Nu, I kept silent. Friday evening we go to RebItschele’s, I carrying my “Chumash.” That week's “sedra”was “Va’y’chee,” “And he (Jacob) lived . . .” (Genesis47:28). And so I begin to read the Hebrew text and trans¬late “Va’y’chee, and he died . . —exactly the opposite ofthe text. The Rebbe asks me again what is the translationof “Va’y'chee” and quite calmly I answer “he died.” TheRebbe closed the book and said to go home.“Shabbos” evening I was very busy in the Big Synagoguewith the other boys, when my father grabs me by the armand says, “What is the translation of Va’y'chee?” and Isay, “Va'y'chee, and he lived, Jacob . . .” “So for whatreason was he a dead man last night?” “Yesterday,” I an¬swered quite coolly, “yesterday he was dead.” Later when wecame home I told him the entire story, of what had hap¬pened during the week, and why I had done it on purpose,to teach the teacher his lesson.By then I was attending the third grade in the govern¬ment school. There we studied Polish, the “national” lan-34“Chumash” with Rashi's commentary and Targum Onkelos(the Aramaic paraphrase of the Torah), some chapters ofthe Psalms, reading and writing in Yiddish.^s Once, inthe last of three seasons here with this melamed, being tooslow in responding to his question, 1 got his leather strapacross the face, so that the blood came from my left cheek.It was before “Shevuos,” we were reviewing the “Akdamus.'’The Rebbe, seeing my bloodied cheek, hurried to my hometo report on me to my parents and to justify his action.Naturally my parents accepted his version. But there wasa sequel.Every “Shabbos” and “Yontif" my father took me alongto the informal study sessions at the synagogue. Here wouldassemble a “Chevra Misaskim,” a congregation of “Yeeden,”to review the weekly portion (“sedra”) of the Torah, withthe commentaries of Rashi and Alschech. I would sit bymy father among the older men and listen, until quiteoften I would doze off.That once, at “Shevuos” time, I was seated at the tablewith all of them as usual. My “melamed” Reb Naftali wasthe group discussion leader for that congregation of“Yeeden.” He opened up the “Machzor” (holiday prayerbook) and said to me in a booming voice for all to hear,“Today you will recite the ‘Akdamus’ here.” Unafraid,in my treble voice I chanted the “Akdamus,” and translatedit from the Aramaic into Yiddish, to the admiration of theentire group. Father thanked the “Rebbe” profusely andtold him to have a draught of beer on his account. This“melamed,” besides teaching, held the sextonship in theBig Synagogue, and had other earnings on the side, suchas bringing an old “Sefer” (Holy Book) to the court housewhen a Jew was under oath. His wife supplemented bybaking rolls and bread. All was done in the same room.All “melamdim” had to have supplementary incomes, be¬cause tutoring of children never yielded enough “parnossa.”So after three terms passed off, 1 was transferred to stillanother “melamed”: him we called the “Kriftscher Mela¬med,” because he was an immigrant from another shtetl.33During the same period I was enrolled in the publicschool. There I had it very good. The teacher liked mevery much. (He was a Polish “schlachietz/’ a countrysquire of the petty gentry, with a blond-red mustache. Heused to call me to the blackboard to do a sum, and wouldplayfully twist my “payos” curls). At the end of the term,because of outstanding marks, I received a paper ikonwhich my father tore in pieces as soon as I brought itinto the house.In this school I learned the alphabet of the Polish lan¬guage and the beginning of arithmetic. I advanced intothe second grade. Here we had a teacher, an old bachelor,whom we called with a Yiddish-type name, Yekele, al¬though he was not Jewish. He had his own peculiar waywith children. He did not beat anyone. Instead he wouldkeep us in after school hours, lock the classroom and leavethe key with the custodian-cleaner who knew when torelease us after the hour. This was a severe punishment.He also used what was a lighter punishment. He wouldput a sheet of paper on your right hand and strike it witha ruler. That hand had plenty to feel and to remember.One time this teacher Yekele detained me for an hour forsome sin. Since the window of the classroom was open andlow, I did not give it much thought and in no time wasout of the window. The next day Yekele said nothing duringclass time but just before the dismissal bell rang, he cameover and said he wanted to see me. I understood why, tookmy packet of books and came over to his desk. All theother children of the class were long since gone. He tookme by the arm and led me into another classroom wherea Catholic priest was conducting a session of religious in¬struction. To me this punishment was devastating, a mostsevere punishment. The priest could see that, so he askedme if I knew the names of the Patriarchs. Yes, said I,Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He opened the door and said,“Go home.”^'^From eight to one daily I was in public school, fromone in the afternoon until nighttime in the “cheder.“ Mythird melamed was Reb Naftali Fuchs, with whom I studied32studying at nightfall. The rebbe’s wife prepared a feast.Every child contributed two greitzer. Each child broughthis own baked roll and a spoon to sip his soup. Meat wenever had, but each child got two stewed prunes. Theassistant and the under-assistant then used to escort ushome, singing, through the darkened streets. The under¬assistant used to carry a pair of brass candlestick bases andbang them together in time to the singing. And in thismanner I completed three years of my first steps of aneducation in Hebrew studies, “uch und vey" (woe is me)such an education.^^After “Pesach" I am promoted to a second “melamed.’’This teacher was crippled: they called him “Krumer Her-shele,” Little Lame Harry. (In truth, no one in Dobromilwas known by a family name. Without a nickname youcould not know who was meant. Everyone had a name anda nickname. For instance the “melamed’s” wife was called“Shvartze Gittel,” Black Gertie. The melamed had twochildren, a son and a daughter. The son was named Yokif.Nu, it is bad enough to be named Yokif, so he was nick¬named Yokif-the-Raven, “Yokif-Varana.” The daughter hada passable name. Henna, so she was named '‘Henna-Shmat-tes," Henna-in-Rags. Otherwise at a distance one couldnot know who was meant.)So I was enrolled with this melamed, Krumer-Hershele,who walked with a crutch under his right arm and a canein his left hand, a sickly man, a coughing old man, bentover triple, and because of his handicap, very irascible.The boys had plenty to suffer from him. When we weresitting around the table and conning our lessons, he heldhis cane nearby, and if any of the children committed afault, or stood up, it went hard with him. He used to pullthe child with the crook of the cane by the neck and delivera couple of smacks in the face. These were not unusual.He used to be constantly hollering at us in his hoarse voice,curse at us, abuse us. We learned very little with him.He also used to deal in earthenware pots, because he didnot have very much “parnossa” from his teaching. In thisway I suffered through three seasons.**^31sack, wipes away my salt tears and my little nose andpromptly sets me to work. He holds something in his yellowcigarette-stained fingers, a pointer made of bone, to pointout the letters to a child. The tears still pour from my eyes,I hardly see what he shows me. I hear him say “This is an‘Aleph,’ (A), once again right here is another ‘Aleph,’ (A),and another ‘Aleph’.” I follow him with a tearful voice,“ ‘Aleph,’ another ‘Aleph,’ and another ‘Aleph’,” so severaltimes.Later my mother comes to bring me home. Early nextmorning there comes to us an assistant who attends to me,helps me get dressed, washes my hands and face, wipes mearound, helps me say the “brochos” and kiss the “tzitzis.”His name was Yussel the Hunchback, and he earns hisbreakfast with us. A little later comes an under-assistantwho collects several little boys and we go all together to thecheder. It was here that I mastered the alphabet to beable to read Hebrew and then to study the “Chumash”(Pentateuch).The beginning of “Chumash” study had quite a specialflavor. The game begins with the teacher and the childrenchorusing together:Question. What does a laddie learn?Answer. “Chumash” and Good Fortune (“Mazel”).Question. What is the translation of “Chumash?”Answer. “Chumash” is five.Question. What five?Answer. Five Books in the Holy Torah.Question. How are the Five Books named?Answer. The first Book is called “B’reshis”The second Book is called “Shmos”The third Book is called “Vayikrah”The fourth Book is called “Bamidbar”The fifth Book is called “Die-vor-rim.”That last name was long drawn out, not “D’vorim” but“Die-vor-rim,” and so with the first error, the mispronouncedfirst syllable “Die,” we began “Chumash,” for luck.It was a good day for the children when we finished our30and “tefillin/’ takes my little hand and lays me acrosshis knee and administers three smacks on my behind. Thiswas intended to indicate that on this date I have becomethree years old. That was my only birthday present. Thatsame morning there were several other events which en¬graved themselves deeply into my memory. They take meto the hairdresser, they shear off my pretty locks, andleave me only two, the two “payos,” one on each side ofthe ears.Returning home. Father took and wrapped me in hisgreat “tallis,'' picked me up and carried me to the “cheder-of-the-‘Beginners’ Melamed.” His name was Leib-Itzik. Itwas customary there that at three every Jewish boy wasentered into “cheder.” My mother had given me her wishesfor good luck, “in an auspicious hour.” The way to “cheder”was not long, but wrapped in the “tallis” so that I couldhardly breathe, the route seemed very long, until I heardFathers footsteps on the wooden stairs into the “cheder.”Finally he set me down, took the heavy “tallis” off me. Isee myself in a large room with several children. Towardsus comes a very tall “Yeed” wearing a long black “kapota”(cloak), with a black and white-silvered beard and a verygaunt, pale face, who takes me by the other hand. I remainstanding between two huge pairs of boots, my father on oneside, the “melamed” on the other, myself in their midstbetween the boots. The boots were as tall as I, and so wego, that is, the boots go and I go to the “rebbe’s” table.Father hands a small package to the teacher, lifts me upand sets me down beside the rebbe. They drink a “Fcha-yim.” Father put his hand on my head and says somethingin language which I first understood years later, when heexplained it to me. The words must have been “May theLord bless you like Ephraim and Manasseh” (the blessingon Joseph’s sons, the grandchildren of our father Jacob, andon their descendants) In other words he meant I shouldgrow up as a good child, walking in the paths of God, andlearn the Torah.Father bids me goodbye and leaves me in the “cheder.”I started to cry bitterly. The “melamed” takes the paper29VOf MyselfThis present installment we commence with the portionof the Torah read this week, namely “Tordos,” our genera¬tions. Whence came I? Who am I? My Hebrew and Yiddishname is “Shaul Ben Meir,” but in Dobromil I was knownas “Shoyl Maier Koralnik’s.” In a little shtetl like Dobromilno one then paid attention to family names.^2 fatherwas a traveling vendor of women’s beads (“koralen,” be¬cause originally of coral), so he was known as “MaierKoralnik” and I was consequently “Shoyl-Maier-Koralnik’s.”He had a sister Devorah and a brother Leib. On my father’sside my grandfather was Issachar-Berish, grandmother Lib¬by. My mother, Rose-Pearl, was daughter of Reuben-YechielMehler (“Reeven’’), a glazier by trade. His first wifeZlata, my mother’s mother, died very young, leaving mymother an orphan child of five. My grandfather Reuben’ssecond wife was named Chaye, mother of Uncle Hersh,Uncle Yusha and Tante Zeesel, mother of Chaye Sura(Sara) who is now in Brooklyn, and Tante Brandsha. Iknew all of them, lived with them, grew up with them.'^^I was born on the fourth of June, 1890, or as inscribed inmy father’s “machzor” (prayerbook) for “Shevuos,” born“Vav (sixth) of Sivan 5650.’’ So far I can write what Iheard and saw around me, and now I write from that timeon as I recall more or less, what impressed itself deeplyinto my memory.I have reached three years old. It was a warm springmorning. My father comes home from davenin with abright “good morning,’’ puts away his big bag of “tallis’’28say there was no lack of competitors. Everyone was hungryto earn a greitzer, so they would be all pulling the peasantmen and women by their white linen skirts to get them tobuy.If Father would come home bringing a hen, or if hewould smuggle in a flask of schnapps, then I knew it hadbeen a good market. Then there was joy and festivity inthe house, and the big baking oven became bright, thelogs crackling to satiety. From the baking oven we childrengot hot flat rolls, and in the big wooden basin was risingthe fermenting dough for our bread. In the cottage it waswarm and happy.27street. My grandfather Reuben told me a tale that oncethe snow fell so deep that they could not go out to drawwater, and that through an opening in the door theytook snow for water.^®As always the main matter was “parnossa.” “Parnossa,’'income for a livelihood, always fell heavily in winter. Thosewho drew their maintenance from their working at homecould somehow manage, so others thought. But those whowere “luft-menschen” (dependent on the state of the market)were really in pitiful straits. My father, may his memorybe blessed, used to groan in Hebrew, ‘'There is no goingout and no coming in/*^^This was the season when those who could, meaningthose who had a few gulden still left, and who had asizeable family, used to bring into the cottage potatoes,beets, and other such foods that could keep without spoilingfor a while. But others who could not buy these goodthings really went hungry, even starved. Such an episodehappened once to us. The potatoes were used up, andbread could not be stored for a whole winter. My motherwas a seamstress, so she sewed up an “Arba-kanfos" (un¬dergarment prayer scarf), to find someone in town to whomto sell it and so be able to buy a two pound loaf of bread.But Judaism was so well secured that no one lacked an“arba-kanfos.” So she went to a Jewish baker and beggeda pound of bread. The baker had cut the pound of bread,but when Mother offered to leave the “arba-kanfos" assecurity for the price of the bread he snatched the loaffrom her hands and would not give it on credit. That nightwe went to sleep having warmed ourselves with a glass oftea.^iMy father used to travel around to other towns with themerchandise she used to sew for peasant children, and hewould try to sell it to the peasant folk who came eachweek into those villages to sell their produce and shop fortheir households. In dry cold weather it was still to beborne, but when it rained or snowed so that he could notlay out or hang up his bargains, he had yet to pay thecartman carrying him and his merchandise. Needless to26each of the cups, with a candle lit each night one morelight, and with great sincere earnestness repeated the“brochos,” climaxing with a burst into song in his highestoctave, the “Haneros Halalu, Lo These Candles.” In thestove were flaming the burning logs, inside the cottage itwas cozy warm. Mama had prepared mouth-watering “lat¬hes” (pancakes) from grated potatoes. At “Chanukah”everyone played games, card games (those who could),others spun the “draydel” with the initial letters “Nun,Gimel, Heh, Shin” for “Great Miracle Occurred There.”^"^Throughout the week the children would receive smallchange, “Chanukah gelt,” as presents. Even the poverty-stricken Hebrew teachers used to suck the marrow of abone, and get a gift of “Chanukah gelt” from the parentsof their pupils. So slipped by the eight days of “Chanukah.”And now we waited for the “Purim” holiday, with thegreatest impatience, not only because “Purim” was a jollyholiday, but because for the children of the poor it was amoney-making festivity. We would fashion ourselves a maskand dress up in girls’ clothes and go from house to housecollecting half a greitzer. Even adults would go from houseto house for alms. “Purim” was a day for mutual exchangeof gifts. It was a day for merry-making. It was a day forgoing around as play-actors. The older fellows of theworking class used to present various playlets, such as“Joseph and His Brothers,” “Jacob and Esau,” similar skits.The whole shtetl, men, women, children, would traipseafter the players, who were called “Purim Players,” andall would listen to their singing and acting these “Purim”plays.3®So we have run through the course of the holidays. Whenwe had finished the blessing of the new moon of “Chesh-van,” the skies were mantled in dark gray clouds. Terrorbegan to settle on the poorer people (only yesterday suchhappy daysl) Many were bowed down by heavy worries,rent money to be paid, for this was the time for rent pay¬ment. It is also the time of severe winter, with its wretchedweather, with deep snows, frosts, blizzards. We had snow¬falls when it was impossible to go out of the house into the25And so had slipped away both the pleasant summer, andso the autumn holidays, and then began the gray, damp,rainy, muddy and snowy days and weeks. And then we beganto count the weeks to “Chanukah.”As I have mentioned previously, winter weather wassevere, and therefore from time to time we had starvingtimes. Going hungry was easy in Dobromil. Going a daywithout food was quite an ordinary matter, not countingthe religious fast days, such as the Fast of Gedaliah, “YomKippur,” the “Tenth of Tevess,” the Fast of Esther, the“Seventeenth of Tammuz,” “Tisha B’Ov,” and also half¬day fasts, like the eve of each New Moon, called the “LittleYom Kippur.” Every Monday and Thursday when theTorah was read in the synagogue was another half-dayfast, and so also on certain anniversaries in the year, yahr-zeit for a notable “Tzaddik” (saintly sage), or simply ifa devout Jew felt that he had done something sinfullywrong, the first thing was to fast.^® Even little childrenlearned to fast early, and to brag to each other that theytoo were fasting. Each had to stick out his tongue to theother: if the tongue was coated white, it was a sign ofnot having eaten. Yes, the wintry days, weeks, months weredifficult, bitter. The one compensating feature was thatdays were short and we might sleep longer hours. And sonow we come to “Chanukah.”“Chanukah” was one of the jolly holidays, with thefestive blessing of the “Chanukah” candles every night.We were “davening” in the “Beis Hamidrash.” When itcame time to light and bless the “Chanukah” candles itwas the fashion for the little kids to cough, to sneeze, tomake a racket, to toss something at the hat of the manmaking the blessings, so as sometimes to silence him inconfusion. But nothing was done to the kids, because theidea was that it w^as supposed to be jolly. When we camehome, first Father lit and blessed the candles, but don'tthink it was all that simple. First of all I had worked allday, hard, polishing the brass “Chanukah” menorah andall its oil cups. My father used to make his own little wicksout of white cotton wool, and poured illuminating-oil into24lapsed, wrapping us all in the tablecloths and bedsheetswhich Jhad draped the walls. A wonder that we got outunharmed.Besides the customary “davenin,” on “Succos” it was alsoa “mitzva” to say the blessings on the “lulav” and the“esrog.”^^ Even children three and four years old waitedhalf naked in their shirts every morning for the “esrog”man to come. Everyone in the house had to participatein the blessing of the “esrog,” otherwise there was nobreakfast, even for the children.It was beautiful on “Simchas Torah” night, at the endof “Succos,” when old and young, man and woman wentto the “Hakafos” (Torah processional rounds), and thelittle ones would come carrying their paper banners, witha burning candle stuck into a red apple at the end ofthe stick, and each would try to set fire to the next one'sflag, and up front the “Shammos” would be tearing histhroat out auctioning off “Atto Hareiso” and the proces¬sional rounds. This would continue to ten at night. Nextmorning was really “Yomtov” in shtetl. On this day everyadult male, rich or poor, was called up to the reading ofthe Torah. All year round I used to purposely take noticehow it was in the “Beis Hamidrash,” and no man who waspoor ever got an “aliyah” to the reading of the Torah.But on “Simchas Torah” he was also graced with an“aliyah” for a verse or two. Even the little boys were shovedtogether all under one big spread out “tallis,” and thedaddies said the “brocha” together with the children's“chevra.” How can I convey it to you? You cannot imaginethe feeling of importance of these little children as theyemerged from under that “tallis.”35There was another custom which was permitted only on“Simchas Torah,” interrupting the “K’dushah” chantingat the “Mussaf” service, and even to playfully throw tablecloths from the covered tables at the “Ba'al-Tefiloh” (leaderof the worship), which one would never have dared or¬dinarily even at a mere weekday service. But since on thisday the “Yeed” was trying to feel a little happy, such prankswere overlooked.23candles, and there were large wax tapers in sand pots andlarge paraffin candles designed to burn a whole day long.When the crowd had all assembled clad in white “kittel"and “tallis,” a genuine awe descended on people; as thesaying is, on this day even the fish in the sea are trembling.Even the non-Jewish municipal officials used to come tothe synagogue to hear “Kol Nidre” chanted, the mayorand his whole suite.^2And now we are up to “Succos.” We “Yeeden’' werealways oh the lookout for “mitzvos,” so right after the firstsnack on the night after “Yom Kippur,” we went outside,no matter how weakened we felt after the fasting, and webanged a wooden peg in a particular place behind thecottage as a marker for a “succah.”^^ (This was only bythe poorer folks. Well-to-do people had standing “succah’’walls which were used year round as a woodshed.) Nextmorning the head of the household with his co-tenantswere up and out to assemble the “succah.” Usually twowalls were ready, a wall of the cottage was one and theboard fence another. The remaining two were put togetherof boards joined with cord or wire. The roof was coveredby green boughs. If God granted that weather was fine,things were passable and it was a beautiful holiday. Butwhat is the law if it rained? “Yeeden"’ are obligated to eatin a “succah,” so one ate in a “succah,'" with the raindripping into the dishes.Happened once, a pretty pass. I was then an apprenticeworking for my meals, and my bosses were taking theirmeals during “Succos’' at a next door neighbor’s. Thatcharacter wanted to brag that he was a button-to-buttonchum with the Master-of-the-Universe and that he coulddisplay wondrous miracles. That season was then quiteseverely wintry. It was practically impossible to stay seatedin the succah. And this “Yeed” calls out in loud orotundtones, “Master of the Universe, thy children here are ful¬filling the “mitzva” of eating in the “succah.” I Such-a-oneson of Such-another bid you to cause the winds to cease.”He said this with great earnestness, and he had barelyfinished his last word when the “succah” crashed and col-22as would not make one thirsty. For the very small childrenin the younger years “Yom Kippur” could be a picnic andmore than one would get sick from overeating the deliciousfood that had been prepared (for after the fast). Since theolder folks often stayed all night and next day in thesynagogue, not permitting themselves the temptation ofserving the children, so the kids really had a holiday. Nu,so let me by the way record what once happened to memyself. In the month of “Tishri” if the plum crop is good,in Dobromil we swam in plums, and we had them bothcooked and preserved. Since I had a free hand to the cup¬board of cooked food, and my father had instructed me notto forget ever to make a blessing (“brocha") when I takeanything in the mouth, and definitely more “brochos”more merit (“mitzvos”), and I always wanted to fulfillHonor thy father^^ and thus I made so many “brochos” thatmy mother had nearly nothing left to serve my father (tomake his “brochos”). But since I was then still small, andit was “Yom Kippur,” right after the synagogue servicethey forgave me.Right from the start I was caught in a fib. It happenedthis way. Mama had stewed plums, made in heavy syrup.Tasting it, I found it to my liking. So every time I enteredthe house I took a “nash” from that pot until, what shallI say, the spoon had just about scraped bottom. WhenMama took a look at the pot at night, both at the pot andat me, I told her that the cat in the house must have doneit, not figuring that it is not in the nature of cats toenjoy plum syrup. But all because it was just an hourafter “davenin,” and after saying “A1 chait” (“for my sins“)I got away with a warning not to do it again or (“chali-lah!“) I would get sick.To return to “Yom Kippur,” to “Kol Nidre.” The menare all hastening back to synagogue, white robe (“kittel")and “tallis” in hand. The “kittel” is a full floor lengthrobe, some trimmed with an ornamental collar of silverthread; poorer folks’ “kittel” not so ornamented, and stillpoorer without any “kittel.” In the synagogue all wereintensely strained. The hanging lamps were lit with tallow21definitely not good, such a sign at “Rosh Hashanah” eve,so it was repeated, till finally the great mystery was solved.The “shamosta” of the women’s synagogue had been hang-ing up clean curtains for the holidays. The miracle wasthat the “shamosta” had heard the gossip in time andexplained it, otherwise who can tell what kind of fatedjudgment would have (“chalilah!”) hung over the Jews ofDobromil.How we come to the “Rosh Hashanah” Holy Day, not oneof your ordinary holidays. “Yeeden” used to make them¬selves ready with all their strength to meet this Holy Dayto beg for the forgiving of their sins of the past year,although it was not as awesome as “Yom Kippur.” “Yeeden”would “daven” with great passion, responding to theblowing of the ram’s horn “shofar.” Married women bakingtheir “chalehs” used to braid the twist of their “koiletsh”^®in reverse in order to make the Satan’s head dizzy, so heshould not be able to prevail on the Master-of-the-Universeto permit evil trials to befall the Jews.Different was “Yom Kippur.” All during the Ten Daysof Contrition and Repentance (between “Rosh Hashanah”and “Yom Kippur”) people would gird themselves as onemust when one is to stand before the judge of the highestcourt. People used to fast almost every day till one o’clock,and on the Fast of Gedaliah a whole day. When it cameto “Mincha” time on “Yom Kippur” eve at the Big Syna¬gogue, the town “shammos” used to “shlug malkos,” scourgethe penitent. A “Yeed” would lie down on the floor facedown with one hand on his heart, the “shammos” wouldtake a cat-o-nine-tails and begin to lash him—not too hard—across the shoulders, and, the “Yeed” would beat his bosomand say the confessional “7 have sinned, I have transgressed,I have offended against thee,” and the “shammos” wouldhave earned several greitzer for his walloping out the sinsfrom the poor man. But not all believed in this business.I used to on purpose observe the “shammos,” following himaround as he looked for customers to be scourged.After “Mincha” everyone hurried home to eat up a bigdinner to be fortified for the big fast. They ate such foods20forgot all about the great calamitous fall of Jerusalem. Theolder folks would hunt around for old tombstones, tillabout one o’clock some began to open their businesses,although some remained shut until “Mincha.” After “Ma-ariv” it was generally no more a day of mourning. Onewent home, and whoever had a good dinner ready wascertainly satisfied, while others broke their fast with a drycrust, “nebich.” So we end the day of “Tisha B’Ov.”In today’s installment I want to tell about three holidays,“Rosh Hashanah,” “Yom Kippur” and “Succos.” But beforeI start on the first two, which were weeping, sorrowing days,I must tell you something about a miracle. Without miraclesnothing ever happened in our town.Dobromil, like all shtetls in Galitsia in those years, wasvery superstitious. If one poured out a little dirty water onthe mound of garbage or on some other unclean place atnight, young and old would three times cry out, “Takeheed,’’ not so that living people should watch out, but sothat one should not “chalilah’’ (perish forbid) 28 get en¬tangled with the demon-spirits or devils who circulate atnight in unclean places with no good intentions. Nu, sodon’t ask, if I was sent on such an errand, or if I had togo past the Big Synagogue at night: I used to hold mysoul in one hand and the string fringe of my “Arba-Kanfos”in the other hand.^^ Why particularly the Big Synagogue?It so went from mouth to mouth that at night there wouldassemble the souls of all departed Dobromiler to conducttheir prayers, and woe (“chalilah!’’) him who passes thesynagogue courtyard at night and is summoned by them!Nu, children would first of all start singing on the highestscales to drive away those evil thoughts which came intotheir minds, and then detour two alleys around to avoidthe holy synagogue, and so precisely I come to the story,in brief, of that miracle.Once before “Rosh Hashanah’’ after dark some womanwas walking by, and she noticed window curtains movingback and forth as if they were dancing a quadrille. Nextmorning, with no radios and certainly no television in thattime, the whole shtetl was rolling on wheels; something19once something happened. One holiday a large bandof non-Jewish boys ambushed them with barrage of rocks,so that the Jewish boys barely got away alive. They madeit home all drenched in perspiration. One of them toohastily downed his fill of cold water, became ill and actuallydied that same evening. Thereupon the town elders estab¬lished a “cherem,” a taboo, that from this day and hence¬forth no Jewish child might tread upon yonder soil. Andso it remained an unwritten law. During that time when Iwas living in Dobromil, no Jewish boys ever again setfoot in that place.Between the time of “Shevuos" and “Rosh Hashanah”there fall two fast days. The "Seventeenth of Tammuz" wasmainly observed only by the very old, but "Tisha B’Ov”is worth recalling.2« That night of "Tisha B’Ov” used tocome with a pall of terror. In "cheder” we had learned whatcalamity had befallen the Holy Temple, the land of Israel,the whole story of the "churban" (destruction) of Jeru¬salem. On this night the shtetl itself looked as if in astate of ruin. All the town was in darkness. After we suppedon eggs dipped in ashes instead of salt, we pulled off ourboots and shoes and in stocking feet made our way throughthe darkened alleys to the synagogue for Lamentations("Kinos"). In the Big Synagogue the "parochess" draperybefore the Torah Ark was down, the benches and theprayer stands all turned over, all seated on the earthenfloor holding a tallow candle in the hand, and so recitingthe mournful Lamentations. We say "reciting” but in trutheach was crying over the fall of the Holy Temple; everyone’sbooklet of "Kinos” was wet with tears, when the "Chazan”(cantor) in his doleful voice accompanied the recital ofthe Book of Lamentations.For us kids the next day was a lark. First, we did nothave to "daven,” no one put on "tefillin.” Such was thecustom: in mourning one does not have a head for "dave-nin.” After the morning repetition of "Kinos,” everyone,fasting, went in stocking feet to the consecrated ground, the“Beis-Olom” cemetery.2T We kids used to pluck the sourcemetery apples and toss them back and forth, and quite18“Mincha-Maariv” we used to light small candles set in thewindows as “yahrzeit” memorials to Rabbi Shimon BenYochai. “Lag B’Omer” means “thirty-third day in the count¬ing of days” (“sefirah”) from the second of “Pesach,”culminating in “Shevuos” on the forty-ninth dayAbout “Shevuos” it is worthwhile to stop and talk. The“Yeeden” became busy decorating the house with greenleaves, called “maiova” leaves, because they budded inMay. The synagogues and pulpits were also decked out withgreen foliage, and with bunches of artificial flowers inter¬woven in the leaves, so that everything was dipped in green.This holiday commemorates the granting of the Torah,and also a second historical event: the second day of“Shevuos” is the “yahrzeit” of King David, so Psalms arerecited, and the story of Ruth (his ancestress) is retold.Also there is chanted the very beautiful poem “Akdamus.”Another reason why this holiday is outstandingly pleasantis the custom of cooking and eating only “milchigs” (dairyfoods) on the second day. The tradition is that when Mosesreturned from Mount Sinai the Children of Israel had no“fleishig” (kosher-for-meat) dishes because Moses (in ac¬cordance with the new ordinances of “kashruth”) had themdestroy all their old “fleishig” utensils in order to start thepractice of keeping kosher. So the “Yeeden” explained,when they let themselves indulge freely in a dish of richlybuttered cheese-“kreplach” with a cold glass of buttermilkor borscht.There was another local custom on “Shevuos,” the Jewishyoung folks used to go up to the Castle on the Mountain.This was not merely a custom (“minhag”) but practicallyan obligatory law (“din”). What was this mountain castle?As remarked before, Dobromil was surrounded by a chainof hills, part of the Carpathians. On one of these hills hadonce been the seat of a rich nobleman. When Poland waspartitioned among Russia, Germany and Austria, theCount left his palace, locked his great iron doors with agreat iron lock which no one reopened. So it became adeserted castle with an air of mystery, to which every“Shevuos” the Jewish boys used to go on pilgrimage, till17At the holiday “seder,’’ my father would put on a whiterobe (“kittel”) and a new velvet “yarmulka.’’ The sofabed was made up with a feather quilt and a pillow for thehead. The gleaming candles sit on the table, two largecandlesticks, two smaller; a decanter of raisin wine, homemade especially for the “Four Cups,’’ a good wine for myfather, the “Pesach’’ platter, a large dish with three wholematzos (without a flaw in them), the “charoses,’’ the bitterherb “maror,’’ the roasted shank bone “zeroa,’’ with thegrated horseradish, and several slices of potato in place oflettuce. My mother was weary (from the hard work ofpreparation) but she really glowed with “nachas,’’ withparental pride and pleasure, when after the “Ha-LachmahD’Anya’’ (the opening invitation to the “seder’’) I askthe Four Questions, in my clear treble, and Dad answerswith the traditional explanation, “Slaves we were in Egypt’’and so on. I wanted to persevere through to the end ofthe whole “seder’’ and therefore, as a child, I used to catchsome hours of sleep by day to be able to stay up.At the Passover holiday children used to get their newsuits and dresses, and so would rise up early and doll upin the new garments and stand at the threshhold of theircottages so that others might be envious of them. AtPassover we children used to play games with nuts (rolledlike marbles). And who can forget the savory “kneidlach’’(matzo balls) in the chicken soup, the tasty browned“chremslach’’ (pancake patties), the older folks with theirbit of good slivovitz (plum brandy) after the fish. Thetaste of “Pesach’’ in truth still lingers with me. It reallyconveyed a light-hearted happiness.Now we go to a second Jewish holiday, “Shevuos,” butbefore we reach “Shevuos’’ there was also one of thoseminor festive days which are not included among thoseprescribed in the Torah. “Lag B’Omer’’ was a sort of aquasi-military Jewish holiday. Jewish boys used to whittlewooden guns, or bow-and-arrow sets, and would play atmock military maneuvers. Many of the older fellows wouldgo, if the weather was good, out to the woods, a littleglade beyond the shtetl for a day of relaxation. At night at16this continued till time for “Maariv davenin/’ Others, thereligiously more devout fellows, used to spend the after¬noon reviewing the Torah.After “Maariv,” as soon as was performed the “Havdal-lah” (ceremony concluding the Sabbath) everything againbecame “weekday.” Work clothes are put on again and onegoes back again in harness to labor.Each holiday had its own particular charm. Nu, let usstart with the “Yomtov Pesach,” at the beginning of spring,with all the freshness and scents of the black earth, whichthe heavy winter snows had blanketed, now warming underthe golden rays of the rising sun which had been hiddensix months behind heavy gray clouds. “Pesach” had itsspecial traditional customs, like whitewashing the oneroom cottage in which the poor lived, and buying the flour,“Pesach” flour, for baking matzos. It seems easy to say“buying flour for matzos” but there were some peoplewhose eyes practically crawled out of their heads (were outof their minds) racking their brains where to obtain themoney to buy the special flour milled particularly for thisholiday then at the baker's.The helpers at baking the matzos included a number ofhands: the “mehl-mester” (the flour measurer: I had thepleasure of that job once for three and a half weeks fortwenty greitzer a day), a water pourer, a woman kneader,rolling pin girls, perforators, carriers to the oven and“shibbers” who put tlie matzos into the oven and tookthem out. You can imagine how such a “Chad Gadya” ofa workshop this looked, all in the small space of the homewhere they slept and in some instances where other workwas being carried on.But when it came time, in this beautiful holiday, for the“seder”—I do not know how other “seders” looked, I onlysaw those in my own home. On the eve before “Pesach”after “Maariv” we went on a “chometz”-hunt, with awooden spoon wrapped in a rag and with a chicken feather,gathered up crumbs from the corners and carried them offto the sweat bath to be thrown into the big oven andburned.15Almost all the workingmen of the shtetl resided on the“Schuster Gass” (so-called Shoemaker Street, although allother kinds^of workers lived there.) As you can imagine,every Saturday morning things*were lively in that alley.Seldom did they only break into a quarrel, but often alsointo the teeth, no one having any idea why or when theywere trading blows in the nose, with the screams of womenand children rising even unto the bosom of heaven, tillit was time to go to the baker to get the “tsholent.”Summer time at the baker’s there was this particularinstitution. There on Friday for three greitzer would' bebrought the “tsholent” to be “put up” for-the-honor-of-the-Sabbath. Each woman had to mark her pots with asign so as not to mix up her meal-for-the-honor-of-the-Sabbath. Nu, since the baker’s oven was so hot that itwas not uncommon for the signs to be burned off or meltedoff; or it happened to some woman who had stood awhole night roasting, cooking or baking that she hadnot properly prepared the “tsholent,” and it came outon “Shabbos” looking quite different from expectations—nu, nu, so don’t ask what a katzenjammer was there. InDobromil all pots looked as if made by one hand. Apartfrom differences in size, all Greeks had the same cheeks{all Yevanim one panim)There were two places for relaxation in Dobromil whereyoung folks used to go to enjoy themselves “Shabbos” and“Yomtov” after eating the big dinner, one, a priest’sorchard, and the other, a level piece of green meadow calledthe Tanz-platz, the dancing field. In the priest’s orchardused to gather the intelligentsia, the young fellows andgirls who were a little more modern-worldly, and theywould discuss world events from the Zionist newspapers.It seems they had a special dispensation to pass the timethere. To the Tanz-platz used to come the working people,young fellows and girls, and pass the time in chatting,laughing, dancing, till about five o’clock. Then the crowdwould set out for a promenade. This was only on one sideof the town sidewalk from the bridge to the Polish churchand back.24 The whole walk took about ten minutes and14IVHoliday TimesI believe that these anecdotes and vignettes of Dobromilwould be missing a good deal if I should not write somewords about the Jewish holidays (“yomim-tovim”) whichwere a mode of cultural refreshment after the impoverished,toil-wearying hard working days. It is true that most ofthe time was devoted to “davenin,” but there were alsoother pastimes.In Dobromil there were several houses of worship. Therewas a beautiful artistically painted “Groise Shul,” MainSynagogue, of three stories high. The main room wasoccupied by the men. The side rooms were little chapel-synagogues where various “chevras" used to “daven,"’ be¬cause in the main congregation there was a limit to thenumber of men honored with being called up to the readingof the Torah (“aliyahs”) There also were reserved areasfor women worshippers, in three places. There was also onelittle bit of a “shul” where workingmen used to come to“daven," called the “schneider-shilechel,” the little tailors’synagogue. There the “daveners” would be finished beforethe others had got started. Nu, so they had a long morning,and on “Shabbos” it is a “mitzva” (proper deed) to drinka drop of brandy “I’chayim” (a toast to life). And it is ifone drinks a bit, one becomes a new man. It is then notproper to humiliate the new person, so one drinks“I’chayim” to the new person. And as it is written in the‘Tirke Avos” (Adages of the Fathers, in the Mishna)when two men are delving together into the Torah, whentwo men became high, things became jolly.2213the child might have to go to the “Chad Gadya” (“Pokey”)for. twenty-four hours for a child’s not attending punctuallyor for missing class entirely.^®For diversions, there used to come, from other cities, acircus, a panorama, only at the end of the summer. Therewas a runner who used to run around around the shtetla handsome number of times, with bells sewed to his reduniform, until he could hardly catch his breath, and then,“nebich,” poor fellow, he would go around with his redcap in hand begging folks to drop something in. SometimesYiddish singers would come from Brod who would givea performance in Yiddish. But it was a great pity on them.Dobromil had no Yiddish theater because the public hadvery little interest in the stage. For the rigorously observant,and for the well-to-do, the theater seemed a “treife” busi¬ness (unkosher, taboo), and the poor did not have the fewgreitzer to pay for such a luxury. Therefore the producersknew which towns to skip. Dobromil was no exception.But “Yeeden” find themselves an answer. Well, so whatif all week each one was preoccupied with “parnossa.”That was so that on Friday evening at a table set with freshbaked “chalehs,” and savoury sweet fish, and “lokshen”noodles in the chicken soup, with stewed prunes for dessert,then the “Yeed” used to burst into song, caroling the“zemiros,” and so also on “Shabbos” after the “tsholent”and the “kugel” dripping with chicken fat.^® At such a timeto be a Jew was to be joyful and to take pleasure in Yiddishlife.I seem here to have minimized a very significant in¬stitution which must be described, the Yiddish Sweat-bath(“shvitzbad”), in which every Friday and every “Yomtov”eve, “Yeeden” would absolutely bring their souls back tolife. The chamber was black darkness, the window panesblack so that no sun ray could penetrate. There were twotiers of steps constructed as places to sit, and a great ovenwith red hot stones on which water was poured so that thesteam would fill up to the roof, and the “Yeeden” wouldcry out, “Ay, another bucket of water to do honor to the‘Shabbos'.”12stand where workingmen stood when they were “davening,”and if onfy there was a “minyan” (quorum, ten male wor¬shippers) they were up and away. In this manner a prayerservice was knocked off every half hour. In the “Beis-Hami-drash," and in the “Big Synagogue,’' matters were morerespectable. There was held only one “minyan’’-service aday. Here used to “daven” the businessmen, and also theusurers, those who used to lend money for interest and thentake from the poor the very pots and pans. During theservice they would be making their plans, biting a point oftheir beards between their teeth, mumbling, pacing up anddown the length of the aisle, and that is how they wor¬shipped.Still others used to “daven” with a sincere heart andafterward also dip into one of the sages’ books. This alsowas customary in the chapel of the “Belzer Chassidim,’’and also in the little chapel of the “Tshortkover Chassidim,’’although there I never went to “daven.’’^^ My father wasnot a “Chassid’’ attached to any particular rabbi, but whenit came to “Shabbos’’ and “Yomtov’’ he was among allthe “Yeeden’’ who were dressed up, having bathed andcombed, strutting from the Friday sweating-baths wherealmost every “Yeed” had been “sweating.” The well-to-dowore their silk cloaks, the poor, nebich, whatever they had.But a “shtreimel” was worn by every one, the richer ofelegant fur, the poorer (“nebich”) of bedraggled tails.But a “shtreimel” was worn by every married man on“Shabbos” and “Yomtov,” except when “Shabbos” fell onthe eve of “Tisha B’Ov”: then everyone took off his “shtrei-mel” and went that night to “Kinos” (Lamentations) ina cap.For Jewish children, besides “Cheder,” there were alsothe state schools which every Jewish child from ages 6 to10 was required to attend five hours a day. Parents wereresponsible for their children’s regular attendance at school,whether boys or girls.Naturally some of our brethren of the Children of Israelfigured out a scheme and used to slip a tip to the attendanceofficer. Not always did this work. Some times the father of11IllCulture in DobromilWe give up trying to describe Dobromil. If we really writeabout it, in all its mud and mire, we would never be able tocrawl out of the slough. So we write today about thecultural angles of Dobromil.In the main cultural activity was religion-oriented. Rightafter his third birthday they sheared the little boy’s beauti¬ful locks off his head, and left only the two “payos” (ear-locks) on each side. At three years they led him off tothe “cheder” (Hebrew religious school) and so he grewuntil his “bar mitzvah.”^^ There were two primary level“melamdim” with whom little boys and girls were enrolledfor a season, for a fee. For later on there were also “melam-dim” of “Chumash,” (Pentateuch), and “melamdim ofGemara” (Talmud), with whom older children studied.And then whoever had wealthy parents could go on study¬ing with several select quite advanced teachers of Talmud.The other boys went to learn a trade. A few older fellowsof parents who were better off, who had a more up-to-dateworldly outlook, were already reading a newspaper, usuallya Zionist paper, by subscription from Lemberg. Others, themore advanced among the working-class, a very small num¬ber, used to subscribe to the “Forward” (Naprzod”), aPolish-language paper from Cracow.The adults, that is to say, the married men, were mostlyoccupied with “davenin” (worship), every single day, and“Shabbos” and “Yomtov.”^® How did each in his way carryout his “davenin?” The “Menachem-Mendls” were alwaysready at the “bretel,” the wooden board, as they called the10Ches, Hog slaughterers, not Jewish, selling only to “Gen¬tiles.”Tess. “Trager,” porters. Theirs was the hardest labor forthe smallest pay. They used to carry the heaviest sacksfilled with produce on their backs, and receive a greitzer,at the most two.Yod. “Yarmulka” makers.Kaph, Cap vendors.Lamed, Candle dippers (candles made of tallow or fats).Mem. ''Melamdim'' (tutors), brokers, “Menachem-Mendls.”^^Nun. Needle trades skilled workers.Samech. Scribes (of Torah scrolls), writers of books. Prayerbook vendors.Eyen. Earthenware pot vendors.Pey. Percentniks (usurers), fur pelt merchants, coachmen.Tzadi. Furnishings sellers.Koph. “Kaddish” reciters (professional prayers for thedead), Butchers, “Kabtzonim” (just plain poor folks).Resh. “Rophaim,” healers (a “Rofeh” pulled teeth, set“bonkes”—cups—and cut hair also).Shin. Shoemakers, tailors, “shtreimer’-makers (makers offancy holiday fur hats) “shamosim” (sextons in syna-gogues).Tav. “Tallis”-makers (makers of prayer shawls).Going by the alphabet, Dobromil should have been avery busily employed shtetl. Of every trade there were onlyone or two, at most three, entrepreneurs, and all of themhad a bare subsistence. Some of those here enumerated hadtwo or three of the listed “parnossas.” A “melamed” alwayshad to have another source of earnings on the side. I mustalso admit that a few in Dobromil were quite well off.True, no Rockefellers or Morgans, but by ordinary stand¬ards the wine sellers, the bankers and some of the business¬men in comparison with the majority of the inhabitantswere well-to-do.9II“Parnossa” in DobromilWith very few exceptions the greatest majority were poorfolk, even though they carried on various crafts and occupa¬tions.The following list of occupations is set up according tothe Yiddish alphabet, the "aleph-beis," by their initials inYiddish.Aleph. "Arbeiter,” workingmen, tailors, shoemakers, tin¬smiths, clerks, worked twelve to fourteen hours a day forlow pay. Apprenticed boys were indentured for three andfour years without pay, sometimes for meals. Iron dealers.Egg dealers.Beis. Bakers, tinsmiths, bath attendants, letter-carriers,badchan” (entertainers).Gimel. Galanterie-trades (“fancy-goods") ; street sweepers(not Jewish).Baled. Doctors and half-doctors, two and a half. The twodoctors not Jewish, the half-doctor Jewish, not licensed,although called a doctor really a feldsher, or barber-surgeon.Heh. Hat makers, “hebamas" (midwives) and the half¬doctor used to deliver babies. Hairdressers.Vav. Vintners, wine merchants, cottonwool makers, water-carriers (Jewish and non-Jewish).Zayin. “Zitser mit frucht," fruit peddlers, pastry-vendors ina part of the Ring Platz; also a salt booth, where only saltwas sold. (It should be noted that some of the wares wereproduced and sold in the same quarters).8cottage. Water-carriers, men or women, used to fill themevery second or third day, for a small fee, if one could pay.If not, one had to meekly borrow somewhere a woodenbucket or a pitcher and go to the well for water. For“Pesach,” they used to cover the keg with a white linencover, so as to render the water “kosher for Pesach.” Severaltimes a year they used to hammer a nail into the keg ofwater as some kind of amulet. To this day 1 do not knowwhat this was supposed to do, what was its purpose. It wassupposed to avert some kind of evil.Every family used to whitewash its dwelling for them¬selves, and this was done only at Passover time, when the“chometz" was cast out of the house.With the rich thiswas half way tolerable. They had two rooms. With thepoor, “nebich,” this was a heavy burden, since they almostwithout exception lived as families of four and six andeven eight in one room. There they ate, there they slept,there they also carried on their crafts, tailoring, shoemaking,tinsmithing, and so on, there they cooked, baked “chalehfor Shabbos,” bread for the weekdays.!^ A “melamed” wouldkeep his ten or twelve pupils and teach them all in the sameroom. It is understandable that no floor was cleaned allyear round. One tracked in plenty from the dirty, muddystreet, which hardened. When “Erev Pesach” came round,they had to scrape off the encrusted mud with iron scrapersand rakes. The only people who did not have to werethose who did not have wooden floors.The poor also had the good fortune to have runningwater in their homes whenever it rained, through the roofswhich were full of holes. Even the beds on which theyslept were wet with dripping rain.That is how the life of the poor looked in those years,1890-1907.7About 1905 Dobromil made great progress in municipallighting, taking a great step forward. Near the Rathausthere was installed a gas lamp. Every evening this lamp hadto be lowered on a cord, filled with gas, fitted with a whitemantle. When it was lit, it gave a bluish-tinted light. Apoliceman had the great honor of being responsible for thisnew lamp. Every evening before the “Mincha-Maariv” ser¬vices we had the pleasure of watching how this new lampwas let down and still more to marvel at the heavy blacksmoke rising from it to the heart of heaven, as once thepillar of cloud in the desert, stretching up to the high dark¬ness of the distant skies.^When I left Dobromil, there were already two of suchgreat lamps. The rest of the shtetl was lit only with littlenaphtha lamps, the size of “yahrzeit'' glasses.^^ Every eve¬ning a lamplighter used to set up a ladder and climb upto pour in some kerosene; so you can imagine how brightlyDobromil was lit.Our homes consisted of one or two rooms. That is to say,only the rich “Yehudim” had two rooms, while the poorwithout exception could barely raise the rent money to payfor one room.In my very early years I remember houses with strawthatched roofs. The floors were clay, usually not coveredwith wood. Some windows were so low that dogs and hogscould lean on them to relieve themselves. Behind the housesthere were pits full of garbage offal, where pigs used toroam for their dinners. In winter ravens and pigs used tohold holiday picnics there. It was simply miraculous thatpeople could come out alive from such unsanitary sur¬roundings.Some of the non-Jews also kept, besides pigs, cows andgoats. Mothers with sickly children on their arms used tobring them to get a fresh drink of milk warm from thecow or goat.Mostly the cottages were lit by petroleum—oil or bytallow candles or by paraffin candles. Only the rich had“blitz-lamps," a kind of hanging lamp.Water was kept standing in kegs by the door of the6fields, and also a number of houses which served the prov¬ince, such as the tax office and other such bureaus.The station was tiny because traffic was light. Trainsstopped at the most for five minutes. The trains were of theold fashfoned kind, and when they wanted to get them¬selves moving, they would sigh and creak, and then theboiler would let off the steam with such a blast that couldblow a man off his feet.Leading away from the square were several side streetswhere the Jewish population dwelt. In particular one alleywas called the “Schuster Gass” (Cobbler Street), not be¬cause only shoemakers lived there (no, there also dwelttailors, bakers, joiners, tinsmiths, saddlers and still others)but because on that street there was always more going on(“toomlen”), especially “Shabbos after kiddush.”^As you have so far been reading about Dobromil, youmust have thought “well, not so bad.” Nu, so I want totake you into the surrounding alleys. It is wholly naturalthat when a guest comes, you show him the beautiful, andoverlook the ugly, the poorer neighborhood.In those years the streets in Dobromil were very badlyilluminated. On every corner there were small kerosenelamps lighted, so that crossing a street one could feel thegloom. Truly it was as is written in the Scripture verse,and the darkness could he feltJ And precisely in such a dimand dark winter night, going on an errand for my mother,that I fell and broke my right foot, and spent three monthslying in bed till I was again able to stand on my foot.There was a second time I fell. This time my father toldme to hurry to “m’chadesh de Tvunah,” to the sanctifica¬tion of the new moon. And being eager to comply withthe Fifth Commandment (“Honor thy Father”) I reallycame running. However, the sanctification of the moon wascarried out by the others, not by me. You should have seenho^v covered I was with mud from top to bottom so thatmy own parents could hardly recognize me. My father con¬soled me that the intention amounts to the deed, as mymother pulled the muddy clothes off me and washed themso that I could to school again next morning.^5Near the Magistral (City Hall) there stood a fine statueof the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, set in a plot of greenlawn and roses, corraled round with an iron palisade.Not far from the Platz used to stand the Jewish wagon¬ers, waiting for someone to take to the railroad station,for five greitzer.3 Around the Ring Platz there were finestone sidewalks. On three sides there used to be smallJewish shopkeepers, who used to wait all week for Mondayto bring in customers, because that day had to bring in“parnossa” for the whole week. Mondays the peasantryof the region round used to come to buy for themselvestheir various household necessities for the week. At thesame time they would bring into town for sale their geese,their quacking ducks, hens, calves, hogs, horses, cows,wagon loads of wood, and so on. And so the shtetl used toprovide its livelihood, one day rousing up from its week-long sleep. And for the “Yehudim” there was a lively tur¬moil, a hollering, a screaming, a bleating, every Mondayuntil time for the “Mincha" evening prayers. Then onceagain all became hushed quiet, except for cleaning up theoffal left behind by the villagers and their livestock, towhich the municipal street cleaners had to attend.^So I have described three sides of the Ring Platz. Onthe fourth side there was a goodly apothecary shop, the postoffice, the court house and a village inn (kretschma). Notfar from the apothecary’s, there ran a path to a woodenbridge where a narrow stream flowed. Summertime “Yee-den” used to enjoy refreshing themselves there. And itcame to pass that there was someone who owned a watermill, and through various political tricks he diverted theflow of water to his mill, and then there was an end tosummertime swimming. The bridge collapsed on one oc¬casion when a stormy torrent came down suddenly fromsnow thawing in the mountains. The bridge was replacedbut water for bathing was no more.®It took fifteen to twenty minutes to go to the railroadstation. That was, depending on the coachman, or ratheron his decrepit nag. On both sides of the way, green clad4IDobromilThe little Jewish shtetl Dobromil was a little shtetl likeall the other little shtetls of Galitsia, but yet it lay ina setting of scenic natural beauty. It nestled there in a val¬ley, this shtetl,! ringed around with lofty green hills, withbountiful orchards, with flower gardens, an atmospherefragrant with bracing fresh air. One thing alone was lack¬ing: “parnossa,” how to make a living. But this we reservefor later.This shtetl centered on a fine town square. This wascalled the Ring Platz. In mid square a tall town clockproudly chimed out every quarter-hour, half-hour, three-quarters and full hour, so that everyone knew the correcttime without ever straining to find out.And there in that tall building was also the Rathaus, the“Magistrat” of the municipal administration, the office ofthe burgomeister, the police department, the jail (for de¬tention from eight to twenty-four hours, when someoneor other had somehow or other involved himself in sinagainst the established municipal ordinances). Also themilitary commission sent by the Austrian government; andthe fire-douser brigade, equipped with a sort of pumpmachine drawn by two horses ready in harness at any sec¬ond to run to put out a fire.Dobromil was on fire almost every day of the week. Thefire-dousers were townsfolk, Jews and others, who used topractice their exercises, jumping from a kind of tower allof two stories high, because in Dobromil there were nohomes any taller.^3evolent Association, meeting at Jefferson Hall on ColumbiaStreet, and more followed year by year, on Stanton Street,on Rivington Street, on Orchard Street, continuing wellinto the 1920's. Still the “alte heim” (the old home) con¬tinued to eke out its existence, although decimated byepidemics accompanying the heavy fighting in World War Iand its aftermath of local wars. Dobromil came underPolish rule from 1920. It became a border town of theSoviet Ukraine in the partition of August 1939, and onJune 22, 1941 it was overrun by the Nazis in the first dayof their invasion of the USSR. For two years one horridatrocity after another was inflicted on the townspeopleuntil in 1943 what was left of the ancient community wascarried off to the death camps. A bare handful escaped,some of whom, with the tireless and energetic help of SaulMiller, came through the displaced persons camps to settlein New York, in Toronto and in Israel.With the collaboration of former residents, living inIsrael and in the United States, a Dobromil MemorialBook was published in Tel Aviv in 1963, to which SaulMiller contributed greatly in effort, in pictures and in someof the text. A year later this present memoir was composedin a series of letters written in Yiddish by Saul Miller tohis youngest son Edward I. Miller. Retaining the Galitzianorthography and syntax of the original spontaneous andunrevised letters, this present translation was done by hisoldest son Leo Miller, attempting to convey along withits quality of classical Yiddish, the tone of gentle ironywhich pervades these bittersweet memories, affectionatewith nostalgia, yet still aching with the unforgettable painand suffering of life in the East European shtetl.L.M.June 4, 19802ForewordIn the now forgotten Austro-Hungarian Empire, theprovince of Galitsia was among the most remote from thecentre, and in Galitsia the little town of Dobromil wasamong the farthest off the beaten paths. You can find iton very large maps, tucked away in the Carpathian foot¬hills, a bit of a distance from Przemysl.Here, at the time of this narrative, 1890-1907, from timeimmemorial one of many self-contained Jewish commu¬nities was carrying on its endless struggle for survival, inthe crevices of a society in which the Roman-Catholic-oriented Poles and the Ukrainian-oriented Ruthenians bothgroaned at the hegemony of German-speaking Vienna, andboth vented their frustrations on each other and jointlyon the stiff-necked Children of Israel in their midst.Of local history they knew little. There were vague tradi¬tions from the times of Bogdan Khmelnitzky, whom theycalled “Melech” (King) Khmelnitzky, but they did knowtheir own folk traditions from Abraham of Ur to Shab-bsai Zvi the false Messiah. They did hear the gossip ofthe romantic tragedy of Crown Prince Rudolph and hisBaroness Vetsera and some remembered seeing KaiserFranz Josef riding through town on horse or in a coach.In those years of change they heard of Captain Dreyfussin France, and of the Kishinev pogrom on the secondnight of Passover in 1903; and they had heard of America,the new land of hope for the people whose exile they knewwould go on until the days of the “Moshiach,"' the trueMessiah.By 1890 enough emigiants had reached New York tofound the First Dobromiler Young Men’s Sick and Ben-1Printed ByWaldon Press^ Inc.To the Memory ofour grandfatherMaier (Koralnik) Treiberandhis daughter Liebe, her husband Jonah and their childrenandhis son Hersh, his wife Zivia and their childrenwho perished in martyrdomin the Holocaust of the Six Millionthis memoir is dedicatedby Maier Koralnick’ssurviving grandchildren in America© 1980LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOG CARD NUMBER: 80-81470ISBN 0-914382-01-2Printed in the United States of AmericaAll rights reservedA Logvin BookbyLOEWENTHAL PRESSP.
