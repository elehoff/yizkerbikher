Whenever that couldn’t be done, we relied on the memories ofthe following people:In IsraelImre AckermanR6zsi FendrichIr6n GdrtenbergVera GrdszSiku KleinBureh PinkovicsSanyi RapaportRezsi VeresIn the United StatesNdndor AckermanR6zsi AckermanJ6zsi (Einczig) EdenDavid FelberbaumViola GotteszmanMagda IczkovicsZsuzsi RothSdmson F6derIn HungarySdri AuspitzJuliska EinczigRiza GlaubErnS KleinBbzsi LebovicsIlus LebovicsHermina TeitelbaumThe facts for the narrative part of this booklet were gathered by the author from thearchives of “Yad Vashem” in Jerusalem, from the “Judaism” section of the New YorkPublic Library, from the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York (withthe help of Dr. Arnon Yardeni), and from the Sz6csdnyi Library in Budapest, Hungary.This booklet was written with very specific goals in mind:1. To preserve the memory of Kaszony’s martyrs for future generations.2. To answer questions which our descendants may ask, such as: Who were myancestors? How did they live? What happened to them?3. To add, in a small way, to the record which is still being compiled, of that periodin our history known as the Holocaust. Every bit of testimony like this can makeit more difficult for it to be claimed that these things never happened!4. To serve as a reminder for future generations not to take their freedom forgranted. Jewish survival needs to be guarded constantly, by Jewish education, bysupport of Jewish institutions, and by support of the State of Israel.The choice of a language for this book posed additional problems. Should it bewritten in Hebrew, Yiddish, Hungarian or English? An argument can be made in favorof any of the above-mentioned languages. I finally settled on English, a language whichwill allow it to reach the greatest number of Kaszony descendants worldwide.Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all those who contributed to thispublication, including Mrs. Betty Steinhart for typing and editing; Temple Israel ofGreat Neck for helping us with the art work for the book cover; Mr. Abe Malin forpreparing this book for publication; Tom and Zsuzsi Ackerman for editing; and last,but not least, my wife Vera whose advice and active participation made this publica-tion possible.Joseph Eden (Einczig)CHAPTER 1I REMEMBER JEWISH LIFEIN KASZONYI was born in Kaszony in the year 1920, just after World War I, when things started tosettle down under the new Czechoslovak regime.My father's clothing store was right on the main village square. Every afternoon theolder people of the village, both the Jews and the non-Jews, would sit just outside thestore, joking, gossiping and discussing present and future politics.As a child I was fascinated as I listened to their stories about the Austro-Hungarianmonarchy, life during the war, the recovery, and the world-wide depression. Anti-Semitism was never mentioned. I got the impression that during our parent’s lifetimeit had never been a serious problem in our village. Of course, in the late thirties all thisbegan to change.The rule of Franz Joseph I, the Emperor and King of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,was characterized as the 4‘good old times.” Kaszony was the trade and administrativecenter for twenty-seven smaller villages, whose populations were completely dependenton Kaszony for selling their agricultural products and buying industrial necessities.Kaszony businesses, which were mostly in Jewish hands, were booming. There wasplenty of everything for everybody.In 1914, Hungary entered World War I. All able-bodied men were recruited into theHungarian army, Jews and non-Jews alike. Of 41 Jews who fought in the War, 15 neverreturned. (See their names on page 3.) Kaszony received its share of refugees fromPoland and Romania. Some of them decided to stay for good.After the war, Kaszony experienced the same events as the rest of Subcarpathia:from monarchy to liberal republic to Communism. After a short Romanian occupa-tion, the Czechs established themselves in power for the following eighteen years.Under the Czech regime Kaszony went through great changes. The Czechoslovak-Hungarian border was established right outside the village, cutting off two-thirds of thesatellite villages. Even the vineyards, which were the main means of employment forthe population, were divded, right down the middle. One side of the road belonged toCzechoslovakia, the other to Hungary. To visit a neighboring village, like Barab&s, forinstance, a passport was needed, and one had to go through two border check points.Life became more complicated and difficult. Many people became unemployed orunderemployed. Some of the stores closed; others struggled for survival. Many of theworkers joined the Communist and Socialist parties in the hope of changing things.These developments culminated in the first half of the 1930s in a world-wide depres-sion, during which many businesses went bankrupt, and families were without breadand other basic necessities.1Socially, the Jewish population, which constituted about 20% of the general popula-tion of 2,500, consisted of different “castes.” Approximately 20% were families thatdid not own any property, not even their own homes. Their only product for salewas non-skilled physical labor. Their living depended completely on supply and de-mand. Many of them very often needed help from the government or from the Jewishcommunity.The largest group, 65%, owned small stores and workshops. They usually ownedtheir own homes and had a marketable skill which more or less took care of the basicneeds of their families in good times or in bad. This group included the butchers,bakers, tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, sheetmetal workers and painters. To this groupmay be added the small storekeepers such as clothing and shoe store owners, grocers,small innkeepers, etc. They were all completely dependent on the favorable economicconditions of the general population. Everybody knew everybody in the village per-sonally and most of the orders and purchases were done on a credit basis. Therefore, inbad times everybody suffered.The third and smallest group, about 15% consisted of the intellectuals, big business-men, and wealthy property owners. To be considered part of the intellectual group, allthat was needed was a secondary school education or employment by the state or abank. To this group also belonged the doctors, lawyers and pharmacists. The wealthyproperty-owners included the owners of lumberyards, of the mill, and those in posses-sion of at least a hundred acres of land, where hired workers produced wheat, corn,tobacco or wine in large quantities. A few Jewish families accumulated, over genera-tions, hundreds and even thousands of acres of land and vineyards. One such familyeven had its own bank.The Jewish families had settled in Kaszony over a long period of time. The firstJewish settlers arrived in the eighteenth century from Poland, and were permitted tosettle on the estate of the Count Schoenbom and Count Ldnyai. Jews having at leastan elementary education were hired by the feudal landowners as bookkeepers andsupervisors.The Jews soon adopted the Hungarian language which was the exclusive language ofthe general population. But Yiddish remained the language of communication betweenthemselves and other Jews throughout Europe,2The Jewish Veterans of World War IMezokaszony izraelita hadveseltjeif1.

From this we can safely assume thatthe Jewish community in Kaszony was established not much later. For many yearsthey could not afford their own rabbi, and were therefore part of the rabbinate ofBeregsza'sz or Munkdcs.From a religious point of view, every Jew in Kaszony was considered orthodox.98% of them kept a kosher kitchen. Most of the Jews attended the synagogue onthe Sabbath, but in terms of practice, the differences were great. About 20% wereconsidered “ultra-orthodox.” They spent a great deal of time studying and in thesynagogue. They were easily identified by their clothing, beards, peyyot (sidelocks)tsitsiot (fringes) and the wigs of their women.However, the great majority of the Jews, probably 80% of them, had none of these“typically Jewish” accoutrements. They dressed and behaved like the rest of thepopulation, except for wearing their best clothing on the Sabbath, when all Jewishbusinesses were closed and the village assumed a holiday atmosphere.The centers for Jewish learning were the heder, the yeshivah and the synagogue.Most of the Jewish children from the age of three attended the heder. The teacherwas usually a person who had graduated from a yeshiva and had decided to devote hiscareer to teaching. He was supported partially by the community and partly by directpayment from the parents, according to their ability to contribute. Children attendedheder generally until age sixteen.More ambitious students continued their education in a yeshivah or in a high schoolin Beregszdsz or Munkacs. To the yeshivah arrived hundreds of young “bachurim”(young men) from within a hundred mile radius to study a year or more with thefamous “Kaszonyer Rebbe.” On the Jewish holidays many more Hasidism arrived to bewith the rabbi. They wore the traditional “shtreimlech” (fur hats), and black or whitesocks under long flowing coats.The synagogue was crowded only on the Sabbath and on holidays. During the weekit was not much ol a problem to get together a minyan (10 Jews over thirteen yearsof age), but not many more attended. The synagogue was the place for circumcisions,for “bevarfen” (throwing), where the bridegroom was called to the Torah before hiswedding and was showered by the women with candy, which the children quicklypicked up. In the winter the synagogue’s “court-shtibl” (chapel) was used for prayers,study, and the discussion of daily events and politics.The community also maintained a cemetery and a Hevra Kedisha (burial society),to assure burial according to the Jewish tradition. The dead were taken to the cemeteryin a special coffin, carried by the friends and relatives of the deceased. The body wasinterred directly into the earth and the coffin was used over and over again.7A special Jewish institution was the kosher slaughterhouse, one for cattle andanother for poultry. All Jews bought their supply of meat from a kosher butcher whowas under rabbinical supervision. Poultry was taken alive to the schochet (slaughterer)and brought back to the kitchen only if he had declared it kosher.Another Jewish tradition was the baking of “cholent”, a dish made of meat andbeans, in the baker's ovens for Sabbath use. Most of the Jewish families, especiallyin winter, prepared this repast in a special ceramic dish and all the Jewish families tookthem to the ovens of the two Jewish bakers where they remained in his oven untilSabbath morning when they were picked up by their owners. This practice precludedthe necessity for cooking on the Sabbath, yet provided a substantial dish for thefamily.Zwi Elimelech FederHayem (Hendrych) FederStudents of the Yeshiva8YESHIVA "ATERET ZVI" - KASZONY 1939THE ZIONIST MOVEMENTThe Zionist movement reached Kaszony in the 1920’s. The first Zionist boy and girlscout organization was the “Hashomer Kadimah” (The Advance Guard) which wasfounded in 1928 under the leadership of Fendrich Mdrton. Approximately thirty toforty children between the ages of eight and fourteen joined the group, which lastedfor five or six years.In the early 1930’s the revisionist movement established a “Betar” organizationunder the leadership of Dezsd Rapaport, Henry Ackerman and Siku Klein. Beta'r re-mained an active force among the Jews of Kaszony until the war, having up to eightyactive members. Each summer several young people left to participate in their summercamps where they received recreational and even para-military training. They worebrown shirts at their gatherings and studied Hebrew, Jewish history and politics. Theyfollowed the teachings of Zeev Jabotinsky. Their “moadon” (club house) became therecreational center of the young people. On Saturdays they had their own “minyan”(10 Jews over 13 years of age) in the “moadon”, which was in one of the rooms ofIgnac Schwartz’s house. Major events of Betar were the yearly Hanukah shows anddances.BETAR - KASZONY 1940Standing: Salamon Jozsi, Auspitz Miklos, Berkovics Bela, Herbstman Pubi, AckermanHenrich, Herbstman Menyus, Klein Jozsi, Einczig Miki, and Grosz J6zsi.Sitting: Ackerman Yoszi, and Friedman Mojshi10PURIM IN KASZONY Organized by BetarPurim shows were organized by Betar and became a regular celebration in the life ofJewish Kaszony. Betar frequently received visitors from other locals, such as Halperinand Eri Jabotinsky, the son of Zeev. A few of them even went to a “hachsarah”(preparatory training) and to Palestine. They were also active in “Aliya Beth,” the“illegal” immigration to Palestine during the British Mandate.In 1933 Betdr organized in Kaszony a “hachsarah” for the movement. About fiftyto sixty young men and women arrived from all over Subcarpathia and Slovakia towork in the vineyards of Kaszony as their preparation for aliyah to Palestine. The“hachsarah” existed in Kaszony for two to three years.11In the mid-1930’s a strong competitor of Betar was established, The League forEretz Yisrael Haovedet (The League for Labor Eretz Yisrael). The local representativewas Suli Klein. The League drew its membership mostly from among the working classand the small businessmen. In their orientation they followed the policies of DavidBen Gurion. The members of the League were less visible than Betdr. They neverattained the same influence, but nevertheless developed a youth organization whichpractically saved the lives of many youngsters in our village.This organization became known as Dror-Hechaluz Hatzair (Freedom—Young Pio-neers). It was formed in Kaszony in 1934 by the writer of this book, who becameattached to this movement in Munkacs. The local organizer was Karcsi Lebovics.The club’s “moadon” was in his parents’ home and workplace. Dror’s membershipcame from the poorest non-orthodox young people of Kaszony. Many of them weretoo poor to attend high school or even to have an opportunity to learn a trade. Thisgroup grew slowly, to about thirty members. They met frequently to study Hebrewand to read together Jewish literature supplied to them by their headquarters. After1939, when the movement developed industrial “hachsharas” in Budapest, mostof them left home to learn a trade there. Many of them survived the Holocaust inBudapest.Except for Betar, the League for Labor Eretz Israel and Dror, no other Zionistorganization existed in Kaszony. While the religious Zionists certainly had individualmembers in Kaszony, they never managed to grow into a viable movement.12THE HOLOCAUST PERIODThe Hungarian Period and the Holocaust in KaszonyIn 1938 the border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary became “hot.” Hungarianguerrillas (Szabadosok) started to disturb the Czechs by shooting at them. Theseguerrillas were recruited mostly from highly nationalistic elements, who were also anti-Semitic. They were potentially dangerous to the Jewish population. At the end ofOctober the fighting between the Czechs and the Hungarian guerrilla forces became sofierce that the Czechs decided to evacuate the population. After the “Vienna-decision”of November 2, 1938, the people were allowed to return to their homes.Two days before the Hungarian Army returned to Kaszony on November 10, 1938,the Jews, like the rest of the population, displayed Hungarian flags on their houses.Many Jews, especially of the older generation, remembering the “good old days” of theAustro-Hungarian Empire, were looking forward to the disappearance of the borderbetween Kaszony and the satellite villages which had remained after World War I.But then it happened. As soon as the Czech army left, the Hungarian guerrillasstarted to terrorize the Jewish population by breaking windows and tearing down theHungarian flags from their homes. The Jewish young people of the village organized aself-defense group and chased the guerrillas back over the border. There were a fewinfluential Hungarian families, like Horthy Sdndors (a distant relative of Horthy,the regent of Hungary) who helped the Jews by summoning the gendarmeries fromBarabds, the nearest Hungarian village.But help was otherwise non-existent. As soon as the Hungarian army returned, allanti-Jewish laws which already existed in Hungary became law in Kaszony. The firsttargets were the so-called “foreign” Jews, those who could not prove Hungarian citi-zenship. They were molested and threatened with deportation to Poland. Luckily thedeportation was stopped in October of 1941, after the Kamenetz-Podolsk massacre.(Described on page 17 in this book.)The next step was the “review of licenses.” Jews were not allowed to keep theirstores or to work in the professions. Only a few of them, if they could show that theyhad served in World War I with distinction, were exempt. Many Jewish families eithertook on manual labor jobs, which were still allowed, or became unemployed. Some ofthe Jewish businesses reopened by taking in a non-Jew as a partner (straw man). TheJewish partner was allowed to work for the non-Jewish partner. For example, themovie theatre was taken over by the Horthy family, but the Einczig family continuedto run it for a fee.Young people, and later the not-so-young, were called up to serve in the laborbattalions which were run by the Hungarian army. All the officers of the labor bat-talions were officers in the army. Jews were allowed to “help out” with the manage-ment and organization of the work task. (See details on page 18.) Fifty-seven Jewsfrom Kaszony lost their lives in these labor camps. (See list on page 39.)13The worst came after March 19, 1944, when the German army occupied Hungary.Jews lost any remaining civil rights and all their properties. All in Kaszony, who werenot in work camps or in Budapest, were transferred to the ghetto in Beregszdsz, andfrom there to Auschwitz.THE LIQUIDATION OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITYR6zsi Ackerman-Weissman, one of the survivors, described the liquidation of Jewishlife in Kaszony as follows: R6th Dezsd and my father Lajos Ackerman were the lastelected officials of the Jewish community in Kaszony. The Germans arrived in Kaszonyon Erev Pesach (the day before Passover) and took over the organization of the "‘re-settlement” program in co-operation with the local gendarmerie. Already on the firstday of Passover some of the Jewish families were transferred to the Kont and Vdrybrick factories in Beregsz&sz. Three days later all Jewish families of Kaszony weretransferred into the local schools and the synagogue and from there to the brickfactory. We were allowed to take with us no more than that we could carry in ourown hands. The ten-mile journey to Beregszdsz was carried out by horse-drawn car-riages, supplied by the largest Jewish landowner, Menyus Klein. In the brick factory wewere sleeping on the floors without any roof above our heads. We built protectivewalls from the bricks, but this didn’t protect us from the rain and wind. For the firstfew days we still had food from home, but later food became scarce. Sanitation facili-ties were horrendous and medical services or medicine in short supply. Some of the oldand very young died in the ghetto. The evacuation started on May 15, 1944. We werepacked in freight cars, not less than 80 people in one sealed wagon. In Kassa the trainwas taken over by the Germans, but we still didn’t know anything about our destina-tion. The trip to Auschwitz lasted about three days. There we went through theselection process. Only the young and healthy people were selected for work. I wasseparated from my father, my mother and Joli, my youngest sister. I have never seenthem again. After some months I was sent with several hundred other girls to work ina factory in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia, where I was liberated by the Russianarmy in May of 1945. I was lucky to find two of my older brothers in Debrecen,Hungary. We decided to move to Israel and not to return to Kaszony ever, ever again.14FROM THE JEWISH CEMETERY OF KASZONY*7HTw^ trnp pton p'~%n eprcy .npiri c%pm iryHminn poy minon vniy^lmtr?

We know specifically about 492 persons, including 109 childrenunder the age of 12. This number amounts to almost 70% of the entire Jewish popula-tion of Kaszony, who lived during World War II, under the Nazis.From eyewitness testimony we know that the trip from Beregszdsz to Auschwitzlasted about three days, with unbearable conditions of hunger, overcrowding andabsence of toilet facilities.On the day of arrival, they went through the first “selection”, accompanied by theshouting of the Nazis, torture and humiliation, which for many was an added test ofendurance and a source of terrible spiritual anguish.For the Hungarian groups the selector was the notorious Dr. Mengele who con-ducted the “medical research.” Dr. Mengele made a sign, and the arrivals lined up intwo groups. The first group consisted of able-bodied men and women under the age offifty. They were flanked by SS guards and taken into the barracks. The second groupincluded the aged, the crippled, the feeble, and the women with young children. Thosetoo sick to walk were loaded into Red Cross vans. This group including those who wentoff in the vans, passed a few moments later through the doors of the crematoriumfrom which no one ever returned.KAMMENETZ PODOLSK(To the memory of Alte Rechama, the daughter of our renowned Rabbi Yisruel ZviHalevi Rotten berg, her husband Zvi Eichenstein, the rabbi of Dobrony, and their fivechildren, Mindel, Chava, Esther, Rachel-Malka, and a son whose name is not known.)In 1941 KEOKH, the National Central Alien Control Office, devised a plan for theexpulsion of the “alien” Jews of Polish and Russian origin, with the promise that theseJews could start a “new” life in German-occupied Galicia. By the end of August, 1941,approximately 18,000 Jews, men, women and children, were handed over to the SSin Kor#smez<3 (Jasina). From there they were taken by the SS in trucks to the vicinityof Kolomea and from there marched in columns of 300 to 400 to temporary homes17around Kamenets-Podolsk. En route they were often attacked by Ukrainian militia-men, who robbed them of their possessions. Those who refused to yield their valuableswere killed. The Germans were unprepared for the mass arrival of the Jews, and at firstactually requested that the deportations stop. The Hungarians, however, refused. OnAugust 27 and 28, 1941, the Hungarian Jews, surrounded by units of the SS, theirUkrainian hirelings and reportedly a Hungarian sapper platoon, along with the indige-nous Jews of Kamenets-Podolsk, were compelled to march about ten miles to a seriesof craters caused by bombings. They were ordered to strip, after which they weremachine-gunned. Many of them, still alive though gravely wounded, were buried withthe dead.THE WORK AND PLIGHT OF THE LABOR SERVICEMENIN THE UKRAINE(In memory of our 57 martyrs, whose names are listed on pp. 39-51)We don't know the circumstances under which, or where, our brothers from Kas-zony died, but eyewitnesses told some of the unbelievable events that happened tothe labor servicemen in the Ukraine from 1941 through 1945. We know that they hadto put up with many difficulties: war conditions, hard work, malnourishment, inade-quate clothing, lack of shelter and cruel weather. But above all ranked the inhumantreatment by their guards, the SS and the Hungarian military police who were rampag-ing in the area.The conditions under which the Jewish labor servicemen lived and worked dependedentirely on the company commanders and their Hungarian guards. Far removed fromthe scrutiny of the central authorities, officers and guards often gave vent to theirown frustrations and to their sadistic inclinations by abusing the labor servicemenentrusted to them. In the winter, in sub-zero weather, their hard labor included con-struction, cleaning and maintaining roads, snow removal, the loading and unloading ofammunition and provisions, building trenches and fortifications. Some of the moredangerous work included the cleaning of mine fields, which sometimes meant marchingover them, or the burying of the dead between the German and Russian front lines.Sometimes they had to replace with their own bodies the horses that collapsed anddied on the rain-soaked mud roads. Their low food rations were very often withheldas punishment or were stolen by the guards. Often, after work, the guards amusedthemselves by tying Jews onto tree branches with their hands tied behind their backs(kikotes), beatings, forcing them to swim in icy rivers and then to climb ice-coveredtrees to become ice statues.To escape was almost impossible. Even if a Jew managed to escape to the partisanswho were hidden in the forests, he wasn’t always safe. Some of the partisans, like the“Benderovci,” Ukrainians, while anti-German, were also anti-Soviet and anti-Semitic.Labor servicemen also had to witness the destruction of the indigenous Jewish popu-lation, an experience that didn’t give them much hope for their own survival.At the end of the war, it was estimated that about 50,000 labor servicemen haddied, probably 80% of them in Poland and the Ukraine.18.

Gallili’s book Tanuk Vagyunk, (“We Are Witnesses”)* Zoltan Singerdescribes what happened on a small collective farm called Doroshich, near Zitomir, inthe Ukraine on April 30, 1943, the last day of Passover:Whatever remained of the Second Hungarian Army after the defeat of Januarynear Voronez was retreating under chaotic conditions. The situation of the six orseven thousand Jews remaining out of forty thousand was even worse. They wereretreating on foot, without food or shelter, for months, in temperatures of 24 degreesbelow zero, Fahrenheit. Many died of frostbite and typhus on their way to theirdestination, Doroshich. Because hundreds were sick, suffering from fevers of 104 to106 degrees Fahrenheit, the Hungarians established a “hospital” for them. It consistedof several large empty barns with straw on the floor. Each of those barns housed sixto eight hundred “patients” in the care of one or two Jewish doctors and several malenurses. The food consisted of black coffee and a piece of bread in the morning andsoup for both lunch and dinner. Medicine was a few aspirin and “paper cotton” andtape. The entire “hospital” was surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by Hungariansoldiers.On April 30, 1943, one of the barns, with approximately 800 men in it sufferingfrom typhus, started to burn in four places at the same time. Later it was noted thatthe doors were locked with barbed wire, so it was obvious that the guards were in-volved. The fire spread quickly. Many of the patients tried to escape, living torches asthey were, only to be machine-gunned by the guard. The fire was over in ten minutesbut it left several hundred dead and burned people. The wounded continued to die inagony for several more days. Mr. Singer, the writer of this article, was one of the fewsurvivors of this barn; he only received a bullet in the leg.It is interesting to note that the official military commission which investigated thetragic events in Doroshich found that “nobody could be charged with responsibilityor even negligence, since the fire had been inadvertently set by a smoking Jew.” Thereport doesn’t even mention the massacre perpetrated by the guard.21BOR AND THE KISKUNHALAS MASSACRE(In memory of Yitzhak Stark, Imre Rapaportand Dr. Pista Klein)The Bor copper mines were located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast ofBelgrade. In April of 1941, following the subjugation of Yugoslavia, the mines weretaken over the by Prussian National Bank and were operated by the German “Todt,” ahalf-military, half-technical organization. In July of 1943 the Hungarian Governmentagreed to supply about 6,000 Jewish labor servicemen to work in the mines “underHungarian military control and discipline.” The Germans also employed a small num-ber of Seventh Day Adventists (Szombatistak), Jehovah’s Witnesses, Serbian convicts,Russian and Italian prisoners—all classified as “enemies of the Reich.” They workedunder grueling conditions eleven hours a day under German supervision. Most of themworked underground, knee-deep in water, breathing air filled with suffocating dustand explosive gases. Their pay consisted of half a pound of bread, seven dinars, and aportion of watery soup. Sundays were spent cutting wood for the kitchen or doingrepair work for the buildings. On the slightest pretense the guards would hang theculprits by their hands which were tied behind their backs. Despite the deplorableliving and working conditions, loss of life was relatively light.Tragedy befell the Jews after mid-September of 1944, when the Germans wereforced to evacuate Bor under the combined pressure of the Red Army and the parti-sans. The first contingent of 3,600 men left Bor under the escort of the Hungarianguards. A few of them escaped to the Yugoslav partisans. The bulk of them marchedthrough Belgrade several hundred miles to Mohacs, Hungary. From there they weretransported to different concentration camps in Germany. Only a handful survived.iiiiiiiissImre Rapaport22A second group of 2,500 Jews, left two days later. They were driven mercilesslythrough Belgrade, with little or no food or water. Whoever could walk no longer wasshot. Close to the Hungarian border 147 tried to escape. The Germans caught themand executed 146. Only one of them got away. In one instance 36 doctors weresenselessly murdered by criminal German and Hungarian elements. Among themDr. Klein Pista and Fendrich Sdri’s husband from Kaszony.The greatest slaughter occurred during the nights of October 7 and 8, in 1944, atCservenka. Here the SS forced the Jews to run back and forth all day to exhaust them.They had to surrender all their remaining possessions. Then they were taken in groupsof 20 to 30 to a huge pit where they were murdered. Seven hundred to 1,000 lost theirlives in Cservenka.Any who survived were driven further to the Hungarian border where they weretransferred into freight trains. The train stopped in Kiskunhalas, where 196 of them,including the above-mentioned from Kaszony, were ordered off the train and weremassacred by the SS, the Nyilas gangs and some of the Hungarian guard. The 196 areburied in the Jewish cemetery in Budapest.Those who did not die in the many massacres which occurred on the way or fromexhaustion on the march were sent to several concentration camps in Austria andGermany, where most of them perished.Memorial in The Budapest Jewish Cemetery for the 196 young men murdered inKiskunhalas, Hungary.23CHAPTER 3KASZONY’SOUTSTANDING PERSONALITIESRABBI YISRAEL ZVI HALEVI ROTTENBERG, 1890-1944Rabbi Rottenberg, the famous “Kaszonyer Rebbe” was born in 1890 and served hiscongregation from 1919 to 1944. He was descended from a family of famous rabbis.His great grandfather was Rabbi Zvi Hirsh from Bezidisow, Galicia, the author ofAteret Zvi (The Crown of the Deer), and the student of Hachoze, the Seer of Lublin.Rabbi Zvi Hirsh died without a male heir ; therefore his work was continued in manyPolish villages by his sons-in-law, and his nephews. One of them was Rabbi Yosef, oneof his sons-in-law, who spread Rabbi Zvi’s teachings in Koziba, Galicia. His son wasRabbi Zvi Hirsh, who inherited his father’s rabbinate.In 1853, his son Rabbi Yosef Halevi Rottenberg, was born. He is also known asYehosaf. In 1873, when he was only twenty years old, he became the Rabbi of Tas,Hungary. From Tas he went to Nyirmada and in 1894 became the Rabbi of Debrecen.Three years later, in 1897, he became the Rabbi of Kaszony where he remained forfourteen years until his death in 1911. He was, probably, the first Kaszonyer Rebe.Rabbi Yosef Halevi was an exceptional personality who became known and honoredall over Hungary. In fact he was considered to be one of the fathers of Hasiduth inthat country. His yeshivah made Kaszony famous all over the world. Thousands ofstudents came to study with him. On certain holidays Kaszony was flooded withchasidim who came to listen to his sermons, to seek his advice and to receive hisblessing. His teachings were incorporated in two books, B’ne Shileshim (The sons ofthe third generation) which was about the Torah and the holidays, and Vaizbar Yosef(And Yosef collected produce). He used to fast very often. Whatever he received fromhis followers he contributed to charity. He died in 1911.After his death, his oldest son, Rabbi Hayem Shlomo Rottenberg became therabbi of Kaszony: He died in 1919. He was the author of “Shmua Tova” (Good News).In 1919 the Jews of Kaszony picked Rabbi Yosef’s youngest son, Yisroel Zvi Halevito become their rabbi. He was incidentally the son-in-law of his oldest brother, HayemShlomo.Yisroel Zvi Halevi was reluctant to accept this position, but he was persuaded to doso by the “Belzer Rebbe’’, Yesashar Dov Rokah. During his rabbinate Kaszony againbecame an important center of the chasidut. Yisroel Zvi was considered one of the“gaonim”, eminent scholars, in the Kabala, the Torah and its commentaries. All of histime was devoted to learning and teaching. Under his leadership Kaszony, which was24hardly known in Hungary, became well known as the center of Talmudic learning andthe source for consultation about all Jewish problems. Rabbi Israel Zvi Rottenbergwas respected not just by his Hasidim, but by all Jews who needed help. He neverpreached against anybody nor became involved in the daily disputes of his people. Hislife was devoted to learning, teaching and spreading the word of the Torah in hisyeshiva, named Ateret Zvi, (The Crown of the Deer). His book is “Or Male” (FullLight). Several times a year he preached in the Great Synagogue of Kaszony whosemembers were less orthodox. But his students were supported by the entire Jewishpopulation, not just the ultra-orthodox.About his family: His first wife Mindl, died in 1919. She was the mother of his twooldest daughters, Alte-Rechama and Ziporah Yentl. Alte-Rechama died in Kamenetz-Podolsk together with her husband Zvi Eichenstein, the rabbi of Dobrony, and theirfive children. Ziporah-Yentl became the wife of Lipa Teitlebaum from Nyirbator. Shedied at Auschwitz together with her three children.His second wife, Rachel Malka died in 1925. She was the mother of his only son,Alter Hayem Shlomo. He died with his father in Auschwitz.His third wife Adel had three children, Rochl, Yoheved and Ester. Rochl lived inPoland where she died in the Holocaust. Yoheved died in a tragic accident in 1935 inKaszony. She pierced her finger with a fish-bone. Ester died in Auschwitz.In April 1944 Rabbi Yisroel Rothenberg was transferred to the ghetto Beregszdsztogether with the rest of the Jews of Kaszony. In the ghetto he was beaten almostto death by one of the guards whom he asked whether he might keep a cheap clock.In 1944, on the third day of Sivan, he perished in Auschwitz with the rest of themartyrs of Kaszony. His book Or Male (Full Light) was published in 1984 by DavidFelberbaum, one of his many admirers.

Follow-ing his brilliant career causes one to wonder how many like him ended up in the cre-matoria of Auschwitz. Gyuri was just lucky, and humanity can be grateful for that!Gyuri is the son of Henrich Klein who owned and lived in the “bank’s building”next to the synagogue, until his death in 1927. After his father’s death, Gyuri and hismother moved to Budapest, but he visited Kaszony frequently during the summervacations. Gyuri studied at the University of Budapest and finished his medical educa-tion in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1951. He spent a couple of months in 1950 at the Insti-tute of Cancer Research in Fox Chase, Philadelphia, where he fell in love with biology.Since 1957 he has been a full professor at the Karolinska Institute and head of theDepartment of Tumor Biology in Stockholm.Gyuri’s achievements are many. He has published over 800 papers in Swedish andother international scientific journals. He has received many honors and internationalprizes. Among them are his being a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sci-ences, a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, anhonorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, an honorary member of theFrench Society of Immunology. For ten years (1973-1983) he was a visiting professorat the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School. In 1972 he received in Israel theRabbi Shai Shacknai Prize in Tumor Immunology.Gyuri lives in Stockholm with his childhood sweetheart Eva whom he married inBudapest. She is also a professor at the Karolinska Institute. They have three childrenand three grandchildren. One of their children, Peter, lives in New York.God was good to Gyuri: he still enjoys the company of his mother, Mrs. HenrichKlein, now in her 90’s.There is another of our countrymen living in Stockholm; Dr. Tomas Kenedi (Klein),a physician. He is the son of Bela Klein, Henrich and Miska’s brother. Tomas hadspent many summers in Kaszony with Gyuri.32George KleinDate of Birth: July 28,1925 in BudapestM.D. Karolinska Institute, 1951; D.Sc.

He wasthe eldest son of a large family consisting of four sons and two daughters. His fatherwas the only Jewish barber in the village, but he divided his time between his occupa-tion and the study of the Torah. As soon as the boys passed their bar Mitzvah, or evenearlier, each had to learn a trade and help out their family. Their formal schooling waslimited; Dezso acquired his secular education through reading. His interests includedJewish and general history, politics, photography, and his chosen profession—drugstore management. Through hard work he acquired his own house, a vineyard, andhis own drug store.In the 1920’s, when Zionism came to Kaszony, he became the leader of the Betkrmovement. He studied the works of Herzl, Jabotinsky and the other Zionist literatureand shared their contents with the young people of Kaszony each Saturday for manyyears. His home became the lodging for such Zionist leaders as Eri Jabotinsky andothers. Under his influence many young people left the village for a hachshara (trainingcamp) and later went to Palestine.Dezso had an exceptional talent for photography and became the photographerof the village. He also played the violin very well, learning it just from listening. Hewas one of the organizers of all the Purim shows and Chanukah plays. His outstand-ing sense of humor was reflected in the plays, satires and songs he wrote for thoseoccasions. Unfortunately all of his writings were lost in the Holocaust. In 1944 he wastaken to Auschwitz with the rest of the Jewish population. Allegedly, he survived thecamp, but he never arrived home.35SANDOR ICZKOVICSMr. Iczkovics was the last president of the Orthodox Jewish Community of Kaszony.His duties included all financial matters of the Rabbinate, the Yeshivot and The GreatSynagogue. He was responsible for the salary of the Rabbi and all other employees.Every Jewish home was assessed and “taxed” according to their ability to pay, unlessthey chose not to. Very few families opted for this exception. He was also in chargeof the welfare of the poor, the sick, the orphans and all other religious institutions suchas the “Mikve” (ritual bathhouse) and the cemetery.When Mr. Iczkovics assumed the presidency in the early 1930s, at the time of thedepression, the Community was in great financial trouble. He worked hard, withoutpay, and within a few short years managed to improve the Community’s financialposition considerably. All employees received their salaries on time and bills werepaid without delay. His devotion and capability paid off in the later years of the1930s, when he managed to renovate the Great Synagogue, modernize the Mikve andincrease the support for the Yeshive, the poor and all others who needed the Com-munity’s help. He filled his “thank-less” position with pride and honesty. He finishedhis life in Auschwitz together with his wife, Ethel, his brother Bemit and their teenagedaughter Irdn. One of his sons, Imi died in the labor camps. His two surviving childrenMiki and Magda, with their families, live in Connecticut.JULISZALIIf there were any heroes of the Holocaust period among the Jews of Kaszony, Julis wascertainly one of them. She arrived in Kaszony as a young girl from Munkdcs, where herbrother was a Hasid. In Kaszony she abandoned the practices of the Jewish religion.All her friends were non-Jews. With them she attended church services on Sundays.Very few people knew that she was Jewish. When all the Jews of Kaszony were trans-ferred into the ghetto in Beregszdsz, she remained behind and used her freedom torescue children from the ghetto. For example, she managed to rescue Manci Waldman’schild from the ghetto. She took him over the Slovakian border and delivered him intothe hands of his mother from whom he had been separated. He now lives with Manciin Natanya, Israel.Unfortunately somebody tipped off the gendarmerie about Julis’ activities; (peoplesuspect Gere’s wife), and Julis was deported with the rest of her people. In Auschwitz,since she was an old lady at the time of her arrival, she volunteered “to take with her”several young children in order to save their mothers. This is how Cili and LenkeHalpert were saved.•(•* tud) *69 o»p iVk? ...noKHe who preserved the life of one person, (his merit is)as if he would have preserved the whole worldSanhadrin 3736Miska's brotherDr. Bela Klein (Kenedi)Miska Klein and his wife HajnalTheir daughter Erzsike is seen with Sari Auspitz.Mrs. Klein and her child were murdered in Auschwitz.MISKA KLEIN, CIRCA 1894-1962Miska was another outstanding leader that the Jewish community produced. He wasborn into a well-to-do family, one with great sensitivity to the needs of all the popula-tion.In World War I, while serving in the Austro-Hungarian army, he earned severalmedals for bravery and dedication. Under the Czechoslovak regime, Miska establishedgood relations in governing circles and organized the first volunteer fire department inthe village. He managed to get all the equipment and uniforms that the fire departmentneeded. For many years he himself headed the department.Miska was also interested in the local sport clubs, mainly soccer, which he supportedwholeheartedly.He survived Auschwitz, but lost his wife and his four-year old daughter, his onlychild, experiences that affected him for the rest of his life.After the war, when the Soviets occupied Kaszony, he joined the Communist Partyin order to offer his experience and know-how in helping the local population. He wasearly recognized by the Russians as being an exceptionally capable administrator andorganizer of food supplies. He received many honors and civilian decorations for hiswork. His influence extended far beyond Kaszony and is said to have reached Moscow,He died in 1962. His place was taken over by the only Jew remaining in Kaszony—Karcsi Lebovics.

They were “legal” from 1936 on, when the Germangovernment put the Secret Police above the law, and the courts were not allowed tointerfere in any way. The camps were intended not just for Jews, but for anybody whoopposed the Nazi regime (Socialists, Communists), for “inferior” races (Slavs, Gypsies)and for so-called “anti-social” elements (the retarded, thieves, vagrants, drunkards, etc.).Most of the inmates lived in barracks, 300 to 800 in each. The worst conditionswere, of course, in the “Jewish barracks.” Food was rationed and consisted of hardlymore than a starvation diet. People died of disease, of hard work or of malnutrition.For refusal of any order, the inmates were shot or hanged.62Each camp was vigorously guarded by electric fences, machine gun posts and SSguards. The SS guards consisted of Germans, Ukrainians, White Russians, Letts, Es-tonians, and Lithuanians. For internal control the SS in turn developed a hierarchy ofprivileged prisoners: Kapos and Block-Elders. There were some Jews among the Kaposand Elders. Some of them were quite cruel.The lot of women was not better. They were segregated from the men by a barbed-wire fence, and communication between them was prohibited. They were clothed intorn rags. Their heads were shaved. By and large, most of the women shared the samefate as the men.Auschwitz was also the site of “medical experiments” where Dr. Mengele con-ducted his monstrous “research” on human guinea pigs.The cause of the greatest anguish and torment were the “zeil-appels” or roll calls,and the “selections.” Inmates had to stand in lines for hours, in any kind of weather.Whoever seemed to be unfit for work was sent to the gas chambers. Auschwitz boastedof achieving the greatest efficiency in the process of exterminating men, women, andchildren-up to 12,000 per day!Non-Jews would occasionally receive a package of food from outside. Jews had nosuch chance. They were given the hardest work, the worst food and barracks, and thussuffered more than the others from cold and disease.Some “lucky ones” spent only a few months in Auschwitz. As the German factoriesneeded cheap labor, some Jews were transferred into “regular” non-annihilation camps(Non-Vernichtungs Camps) where conditions remained harsh, but better than in Ausch-witz. When those camps were freed by the armies of the Allies, very few of the Jewsreturned to Kaszony. The bulk of the survivors settled in Czechoslovakia, Hungary,and later in the United States and in Israel.The American Flag is raised over liberated Dachau63Survived I Settled in I Dieds0Z,6lsipuis096l91D ujS0S6aq; us0'b,61ain ui9J9l|M9SigBtqpsdiBoqnsjs9dBpngvsn[9BJSJ9J9l|MS|gAuuy}S9dBpngduiB3joqBqzjiAupsny< < <oo oo ooP D Poooo>£>tfetf38&MM05 t-M l-H (—IA -u S•S ||3? >3 06a 15 is a •gssSasIml|&C/5 CflU ^CA o ‘a «N J-5 C opeJttj o-j •&Q e<J<64«?wi?3plugSurvived I Settled in Died65FELBERBAUM Mindl • • • USA*Duved Hung. •Haya (Pipi) # • • USA*Survived I Settled in I DiedDiedWhere?CanadaSO 861UJ•s096lS0F61uiSettled in9J9l|M9S|gCanadaCanadaVenez.mqtediBoqnstsadepngvsnJ9RISI• •urvived9J9l|AVS{g[Auuy•tsadBpngGOduiB3joqBq• #TA J9q;o jozjiMqosny• •SurvivorsRozsiJozsefBozsoFeriLaciX XU Vt—< *—<Pi PiQ QZ ZUJ uju- u-FENDRICH Lala I • I • I • Hungary66Survived I Settled in I Dieds086tuiso L6\aqj uis09613qj uiS0S6us0^6lui9J9qM9SigBiq^BdjBoqnsjssdBpngVSflPBJSI3J3qMS|3AuuyisadspngduiB3joqBqzn jozjtMqosny&&«QfodcP3<&o13CO(h<</3X35DQOD& ste© 60S c3 3X X'<3cE2 2 &<3 r « ■- ?jD «« .21 OiQiN I• •—i •—2•O « c£ o £• i—» CTJ00 > ^ft) ^c w c '53 g'03 *o 43 O »■* ft>co ^ S s uj >• ~ 53 :0J3 N C1$ 'O 0)CO 1—.a:UU2<UJ£OQCOQGOUJNDDHHCO<<HPOOOCCOOooo67GRUNBERGER Aladar • | | Czech.! • Czech.Jeno USA *Survived I Settled in I Died68KLEINSurvived I Settled in I Died699J91JM3SJ3BupBdjBoqnsjsadBpngvsn|9BJSJ9isqAvsi3Auuy;sodBpngduiB3joqBqZ3I 10ziiMipsnyeGCx:<D<D<yOT3T3T5<u<U0><DNr \££U0000  SO C/2 C/3 00 C/j C/SD D D D DC/5« 3 2 g.2 c « E eg^ S U > CQmu QC w^ Jq• T3G g £O S e•— cl, w.

The Jews escapedby miracles and sometimes because the Nazi beasts and their lackeys didn’t have timeto finish their criminal business. A small percentage of people returned from the con-centration camps or the labor battalions. Others survived in Budapest, in Swiss orSwedish protected houses, or with false, assumed Christian papers. Very few, if any,were hidden by the general population. Most Hungarians, even if they were not Nazis,didn’t want to get involved; it was too dangerous. As always, apathy helps the aggres-sor, never the victim.Let us examine a few cases of those who managed to survive.//JENO ACKERMANJeno grew up in Kaszony. He was a devoted fol-lower of Betar and a natural charismatic leader. InOctober 1941 he was recruited into the labor ser-vice in Kassa. He became the SZKPH (Szakasz-parancsnok Helyetes), the assistant to the unitcommander. He was a hard worker, well disciplined,and always ready to defend the members of “his”unit against the guard.In 1943, just one year before his unit was to be sent to the Ukraine, the HungarianArmy was looking for all kinds of artisans to work in Budapest. Jeno volunteered.In Budapest, the “artisans” enjoyed exceptionally good conditions, similar to those ofany Hungarian Army unit. After work they were free to move around the city. Jenoused his freedom to get in touch with the underground Zionist movement which wasprimarily engaged in the “legalization” of refugees whom they provided with thenecessary “Aryan” identification papers, Jews from Poland and Slovakia. AfterOctober 15, 1944, when the Nyilas gangs took over the government, the productionof “Aryan” papers greatly increased. Jeno and his friends produced not just “Aryan”papers but also stamps and seals used by the authorities, even Nyilas membershipcards. He distributed these papers without any compensation to anyone known to himor needing his help. In fact, he disguised himself as a Nyilas and participated in theirmeetings to learn something about their plans and to tip off their intended victims.Jend joked for years about an incident which happened at one of those Nyilas meet-ings. The Nyilas unit leader picked him out as having a “typical Aryan face.” He ex-plained to the others how Jeno’s face was different from a Jewish face.Jenb survived the war in Budapest. He died in 1970 in Brooklyn, New York. He lefthis wife and two sons, Peter and Ronney.76SIKU KLEINSiku lived in Budapest during the war under an assumed name to avoid being draftedinto the Labor Service. When the Germans occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944, theNyilas and other extreme rightist elements were helping to find Jews who had escapeddeportation by fleeing from the countryside or who were living in Budapest illegallyThose who were caught were deported or jailed, and after the October 15 1944putsch of Szalasy, summarily executed. The River Duna was full of Jewish corpseskilled by the Hungarian Fascists.Siku knew many other Jews who were living under the same circumstances as he.He decided to organize them into a Christian congregation, with himself as the priest.He acquired the necessary vestments, studied the New Testament and how a priest anda Christian congregation behaved. His “congregants” were well screened; only Jewswere accepted. In the chaos which characterized those days, many people were arrivingin Budapest as refugees from territories occupied by the Red Army. Therefore it wasn’tunusual for new small Christian congregations to open and close their doors all thetime. Siku’s plan worked. He escaped unharmed with all the members of his “congrega-tion.” Siku now lives in Jerusalem, is married, the father of two children and hasseveral grandchildren.REZSI VERESRezsi wrote her memoirs under the name of Ruth Bergner: The name of her book isAzok Vagyunk (We Are Those). It was published by Delta Publishers in Israel. Thebook contains 196 typewritten pages in which she describes her miraculous escapefrom deportation together with her two young daughters.Rezsi grew up in Kaszony, but was married in Bocsko, a small village in Maramaroscounty near the Romanian border. When the Hungarians occupied all of Subcarpathiain March of 1939, the Hungarian gendarmerie and the Kdmelhdritd (Counter-Spy Unit)started to terrorize the Jewish and Ruthenian populations. In Bocskd a non-JewishCommunist fled to Russia, leaving behind a family with small children. Somebody withhumanitarian motives decided to collect money for his family. The Kdmelhiritd some-how obtained a list of the donors, most of them Jews. Seventy Jews were jailed with-out trial. Rezsi’s husband was tortured to death by the K^melhdritd in the infamousKoner-castle in Munkacs where hundreds were brutally tortured by the HungarianCounter-Spy Unit. He was buried by the “Hevra Kadisha” without the presence of anyof his family members.In 1944 just before the deportation, Rezsi fled to Budapest with her two smalldaughters. She managed to obtain false Christian documents for herself and the chil-dren. She taught them to pray and to behave like Christian children. They were alsotaught to claim that they were Hungarian refugees who had fled their homes in fear ofthe Russian Army. Their documents were checked numerous times by the Nyilas gangsand by the gendarmerie, but no fault could be found with them.Rezsi was invited by some peasants to come to their village where she did houseworkand farming until the end of the war. She now lives in Haifa with her two daughterswho are married and has three grandchildren.77ALEX SCHNEIDERAlex was the youngest child from Kaszony to survive Auschwitz and other concen-tration camps. He was only twelve years old when he was deported in 1944. Before heleft, his father took him to the Kaszonyer Rabbi, Rabbi Jisrael Zwi Rottenberg andasked his blessing for his son. The Rabbi blessed Alex.At the selection at Auschwitz and at all the other selections Alex always envisionedtwo angels standing behind him. When the Nazis passed him as looking strong and fitfor work, he escaped sure death.After a few months he and his father were transferred to work in a factory in Zitau,Germany. Not long before their liberation, his father became weak and ill and askedAlex to do everything he could not to let his body be burned by the Nazis. When hedid die, Alex secretly buried him.After the war, Alex found his father’s grave and buried him according to Jewishcustom. Alex now lives in Los Angeles. He is married and the father of three children.Whenever he travels to Israel, he stops on the way at the grave of his father in Germanyfor Kever Avot.JOZSI EINCZIG (EDEN)It was not an easy task to select a few “characteristic” survivors to tell their storiesfor this book. Each of Kaszony’s survivors has an interesting story to tell, but this bookcouldn’t contain all of them.I am the only survivor of a family of six. Each member of my family died in one ofthe tragedies that befell our village. Both of my parents died in Auschwitz, probablyright after their arrival. My sister Ter6z survived a couple of selections, but not all. Shebecame a victim of one of those selections in September or October of 1944. Her sonImre was killed at Kiskunhalas (see story, page 22) of this book). My oldest brotherMiklos survived the death marches from Budapest, including the concentration campin Buchenwald. He died after the liberation on his way home to Budapest, in Gunskir-chen, Austria. My other brother, Lajos, went to the Ukraine with a labor battalion in1941. In the summer of 1943 we were notified that he had died in Doroshich. He wasone of the black typhus sufferers who died in the fire of the “hospital.” (See story onpage 21.) Lajos5 daughter Jutka and his wife both died in Auschwitz.My survival, like that of everybody else, was truly a miracle. I was “recruited” intoa labor battalion in 1941. After a short training in Kassa, we were sent to Transylvania*to build a railroad bridge. We worked hard, but the food was relatively decent and weall survived the harsh winter intact. In 1942 we built an airport in Szentkiralyszabadja*near Lake Balaton. We lived in army tents, but the treatment was fair except for a few“hangings by the hands” punishment for taking unauthorized absences to Budapest.In 1943 we were sent back to Transylvania to build a telephone communicationline through the Carpathian Mountains. We spent every other day in a different village.The treatment was again fair. At the end of 1943 we were sent to Poland and theUkraine. At that time all that was left of our army uniforms was the hat and a yellowband on our left arms. As we arrived in Brody (Poland), we were taken over by a dif-ferent Hungarian unit. They “greeted” us with what the American Indians called“running the gauntlet”, which involved being forced to run back and forth between*See pictures on page 2078J6zsi Einczig (Eden) in Czechoslovak uniform at the statue of Jan Hus in Prague (1945)two rows of soldiers wielding whips and canes. The next day we were taken by cardirectly to the front line. After a short training, we were sent to work between thefront lines to pick up mines and to bury the German, Hungarian and Russian dead.We worked all night between the two lines, while both the Russians and the Germanskept shooting at each other. There were very few Jewish survivors. I was one of them.A few weeks later the Hungarian army came looking for auto mechanics. BecauseI had my driver’s license with me, I volunteered. This driver’s license probably savedmy life. I was sent with a group of about 100 Jews to work for the field unit of theHungarian Army at repairing cars for the Germans and Hungarians. The command-ing officer of the unit was a first lieutenant, a lawyer from Miskolc. He was a real“mentsh”; there were very few like him around. He hated the Germans and didn’tcare much about the war. We were treated not just fairly, but exceptionally well.Every day we received the same rations as the German soldiers, cigarettes, vitamincandies, sodas. Meat and bread were available without restrictions. I can best charac-terize this man’s humanity through my own story. One day the Germans brought ina big truck. The problem was a screw which had broken off, part of which was em-bedded in the motor. 1 was told to make a hole in the screw and to remove it with alarge screwdriver. Because I had difficulty getting the screwdriver into the hole, I de-cided to make use of a ten pound hammer. Of course, the entire motor cracked. Intime of war, this would be considered sabotage, punishable by death. One of the Jew-ish workers decided to inform the commanding officer before he got an official report.The commanding officer wasn’t shocked, and knew exactly what to do. He sent fourJews in Hungarian uniforms to the nearest supply depot with an order to exchange thewhole motor for a new one. When the Germans arrived a few days later, the truckhad been “repaired.”When the Russian Army was nearing, the unit received an order to return to Hun-gary. The commander summoned a few Jews who were in close contact with him andsaid, 44My boys, (he never called us just Jews), I haven’t forgotten my promise to takeall of you home to Hungary alive. But you know what has happened in Hungary (the79German occupation), and therefore I wouldn't advise you to return with me. Gowherever you can!” Of course he meant that we should all try to get over to theRussians.I and three of my Jewish friends received a German luxury car, an Opel Captain,“to save it from the Russians.” We filled it up with fifty pounds of butter, bread,conserves, salami and whatever else the kitchen had left behind. If anything wereto go wrong with the car, we had permission to bum the car, “not to leave it to theRussians.” When we arrived at a small village called Dolina, near the Hungarian border,we decided not to go further. We found an empty Jewish house which was some dis-tance from the main road and transferred the food from the car into the attic. To makesure that nobody would ever use the car again, we burned it on the spot and retiredinto the attic. From there we watched the German army retreat in defeat. The samenight, the Russians arrived.In the morning we came out of hiding and identified ourselves as Jews, but thisdidn’t make much of an impression on the Russians. They took away all our food,our watches and other belongings and put us into a prisoners camp, together withabout 20,000 Germans, Hungarians, Romanians and others who had fought againstthem. We went together on a march on foot that lasted over a month to Kiev, thecapital city of the Ukraine. From Kiev we were sent to a prisoner of war camp inZaporozhnye, a large city near the Dnieper River. In this camp we were separated fromthe Germans and were allowed to live together with other Jews in the same barracks.We were not allowed to leave the camp except for work which consisted mainly ofunloading cargo from the ships which arrived on the Dnieper.Again I was lucky. I became a member of a tin workers unit which made bakingforms for the camp’s bakery. Having connections with the bakery gave us access tobread, which, next to gold, was the best “monetary unit” in the camp. Soon we hadeverything to make our lives easier.As soon as we had arrived, many of my friends and I had volunteered to join theCzechoslovak army in Russia. After three months we were sent to Moscow into atransit camp. In Russia at least 60% of the Czechoslovak army consisted of Jews whohad somehow managed to survive. My induction into the army was simple. The recuit-ing officer was a Jew named Elovics, from Beregsz&sz. Because he wanted to know thatI was Jewish, he asked me to recite the “Mode Ani” (“I thank thee”) from the prayerbook. As I had no trouble doing this, I was soon dressed in an all new uniform travel-ing to Lvov (Lemberg). When the authorities discovered that I was a high school grad-uate and could speak the Czech language, I became the head clerk of a unit whichfought the Germans until the end of the war. As a veteran I was given a German’sapartment in Bmo and four years of scholarship at the University of Brno.In liberated Prague(1945)80Those of The Jewish Youth of Subcarpathia, who survived the Hungarian Labor Camps, andmanaged to escape to the Russians, had two choices: a) To remain in a Russian prisoner of warcamp and share the fate of other prisoners, such as the Germans, Italians, Hungarians, etc.b) To join one of the fighting armies: The Russian Army, The Czechoslovakian Army in Russiaor The Hungarian Army in Russia. Most of them joined The Czechoslovakian Army.Membership Card in The Czechoslovakian War Veteran Organization.*iClensky prukazBratrJosefEinczig8-XJ-1920Datum narozeni  Zamistndni  d ^Bydim B r n a ♦VNa Sobodeoh 4# jest HenemSVAZU NARODNl revolucesdruient.*ztmakAdbotky v B r. n. 3.VlmMnomini podpis mvjitd* pr&JkmmTen to prukaz ve spojenf s jin^m ufednlm prA-kazem s fotografii opravfiuje k nolenl odznakuSNR a je platny, je-li majitelem vlastnoni6n$* podepsAn, fAdnA potvrzen orgAny SNR a je-lizapiacen clensky pfispAvek na pMsluftny rok.Prukaz byl vyddn dne81CHAPTER 6THE STATISTICSThis book follows the fate of 11A Kaszonyers who lived there during the period of1938-1945 or emigrated during the 1930s, when the shadow of Nazism emerged inEurope.

Many died from exhaustion,from irreversible sicknesses and from malnutrition, in the hospitals of Germany andAustria, in displaced persons camps, and on their way to look for a new home inPalestine, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the United States, or any other country in theworld that might be willing to accept them. Some had survived concentration camps,others labor camps, prisoner-of-war camps, partisan camps, and the various armies ofthe Allies. Many survived in large cities like Budapest with false names and identitypapers. All had a horrible story to tell.Their plight was extremely painful. There were no homes to return to, no familiesto rely on for help. Many of the non-Jews were hostile and still poisoned by racialhatred. They were tearful of losing the Jewish loot they were hiding and the Jewishhomes in which they were living.Ot the 20,000 survivors, the great majority did not return to Subcarpathia, butremained in D.P. camps in Germany in the hope of reaching Palestine or some otherdestination. Up to 8,000 moved westward to Czechoslovakia, most of them into townsin the Sudeten area which was depleted of its former German population.A few tens settled in Budapest, others in countries on five continents. Some groupsresettled in their former places of residence in Subcarpathia. Later other Jews arrivedfrom distant parts of the Soviet Union, mainly office workers and technical adminis-trators employed by the Soviet state. Differences developed between the two Jewishgroups and they did not amalgamate. Cultural differences remained. According toSoviet estimates, there were 13,000 Jews in Subcarpathia in 1971. The actual numberwas probably much greater, but there was no real Jewish life to speak of. The rem-nants of the Jewish heritage was maintained by only a few survivors of the originalJewish population.In the second half of the 1970s the Soviets opened the doors for many to leave.Hundreds of families left Subcarpathia for Israel, Hungary, the United States and othercountries of the world. Very few remained of the “original” population. In Kaszony, asfar as is known, only one family remained-the family of Karcsi Lebovics. The news ofhis.death arrived when this book was in the stage of printing.85After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and The Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia,many Subcarpathian Jews moved to Israel or to the West.In Israel, both boys and girls joined the Israeli Armies to fight for it's survival.One of our boys, David (Laci) Eisenreich sacrificed his life in the 1956 Sinai Campaign.'{4mDavid (Lacika) Eisenreich(1930-1956)Sitting: His mother, Margit Glaub, his uncle, Vili Rapaport and his aunt lionRapaport.

He was only 14 years old when he was sent to Auschwitz.Mengele spared his life because of his early developed physique.In Auschwitz he was lucky to get a “job” as a courier, and to supply both himselfand his mother with food. In 1945 he was evacuated to Winzheim near Ntirnbergwhere he was liberated by the American Army.After the war, in 1947, he was a “passenger” on the ship “Exodus” which wastrying to enter Palestine “illegally,” but was returned by the British to Germany. Afew months later he tried to enter Palestine again, but this time he was interned inCyprus. Only after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 was he allowed toenter the promised land together with his mother. In Israel he joined his aunt anduncle, Vili and lion Rapaport.In 1949 he married Shoshi Stern from Munkdcs and soon after that he joined theIsraeli Army for two and a half years. He became the driver of General Rabin, theformer Prime Minister. After a short stay at Mikv£ Yisrael, a school for agriculture, hejoined the “Dan” Bus Cooperative as a bus driver. In 1956 he was called up to serve inIsrael’s Sinai Campaign against the Egyptians. He fell, as a fighter, October 31, 1956,on the third day of the war. He is buried in Kiryat Shaul Cemetery near Tel Aviv. Heleft behind his mother, wife, and two young children: Xri and Telma.87(1986) Rapa port Sanyi's visit in the USA.

Its territory adjoins the U.S.S.R. in the north and east, Czech-oslovakia in the west, Romania and Hungary in the south.Subcarpathia consists of four counties: Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa and M&romdros. Itsterritory encompassed 12,171 square kilometers (4,257 square miles) with a totalpopulation of about 00,000. Oi these, 100,000 were Jews. (All population figuresgiven throughout are for the period between World War I and World War II.)During its long history Subcarpathia was ruled by many conquerors and acquiredmany different names, such as KArpdtalja (Hungarian), Podk&rp&tska Rus (Czech-oslovakian), Zakarpatskaya Oblast (Ukrainian), and Subcarpathia (English). The areahas also been called Ruthenia, Carpathian Ruthenia, Carpatho-Ukraine, SubcarpathianRussia, Ruska Kraina, Transcarpathian Ukraine, etc. The name depended on who wasdescribing the area, and when.Kaszony itself was also known as Mezokaszony (Hungarian), Kosino (in Czech andRussian). The non-Jewish population was 100% Hungarian. About 60% were Catholic22% Protestant, and 18% Jewish.Tiic main cities of the area included Ungvar (Uzgorod), the capital and administra-tive center of the area with a population of 30,000 of which 33% were Jewish; Mun-kacs (Mukachevo), the trade and cultural center of the area, population 30,000,50% Jewish; Beregszasz (Berehovo), population 12,000, 29% Jewish; Vinogradov orNagyszolos (Seyjus), population 60,000-20% Jewish; Huszt (Hust) population, 5,000,16% Jewish; Korosmezo (Jasina), population 1,500, 12% Jewish.96co re •'ir"Sfco re 75" > s2 Pl» <g© uV ESiz c•S ZC ^c£ir •—i©X Xu uO uN WUSu ^h H* ^   us S,E.S B-i.2a?ftj *_X3 re r» rnO > *3 u.t ^ - D-,3 ^ 're' ^cr O ^O X V) .5re © u© •« re- n cb *rBU- «P J"x g h5 o“ £ (3 31*8 If IX >—•* U *T3•* re © &'«j *r u“ts r cn •«•*; r> _, 3^ C ^ g-* .

At the end of World War I, the territory passed to Czechoslovakia.In November of 1938, under German pressure, the Decision of Vienna returned part ofthe area, including Kaszony, to Hungary. In March of 1939, all of Subcarpathia wasoccupied by the Hungarian Army. After World War II, in 1945, Subcarpathia wasceded to the Soviet Union and became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republicas the province of Transcarpathian Ukraine.THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN PERIODDocuments confirm the presence of Jews in Subcarpathia from the first half of the17th century. Some survivors of the Chmelnicky massacres of 1648 who escaped fromPoland to Hungary settled in Subcarpathia. According to the Hungarian governmentcensus of Jews, there were about 100 families, or 450 persons there between 1725and 1728. The movement of Jews from Galicia in Poland became even stronger after1772, when Galicia became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Jews fromGalicia settled in Subcarpathia in the hope that Hungary would provide them withbetter economic opportunities and a more stable political setting.At first the main occupations of the Jews were the manufacture and sale of liquorand beer on the estate of various noblemen. The largest estate was that of the Houseof Schoenbom, from whom the Jews leased the right to mill flour as well as to sellwhiskey and meat. Jews were also engaged in the transporting of lumber as far awayas Danzig on the Baltic Sea. Jews also worked in the fields, raised cattle and becameartisans. They had to work very hard to eke out a living and to pay the ever-increasingtaxes. Bread was made of oats and maize; white bread was rare, baked only for theSabbath.I he J e wadopted many of the ways of their non-Jewish neighbors, such as wearingfur hats and white woolen clothing in the winter.In spite of hardships the number of Jews increased steadily through natural growthand through immigration. Jews were scattered throughout many villages, with one or100two Jewish families in each. There were few rabbis or Jewish teachers in the area,which resulted in spiritual and cultural desolation.In 1848 and 1849 the Hungarians staged a revolution against the Austrian Habs-burgs. Many Jews from Subcarpathia actively supported the revolt by joining thearmed forces of Lajos Kussuth. In 1867 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire was estab-lished, the Parliament voted to remove all judicial and economic strictures that hadbeen laid on their Jewish citizens. In spite of this, anti-Semitism remained strong.While Jews advanced rapidly in commerce and in the liberal professions, very few wereallowed to serve in public administration.According to the census of 1891, the Jewish population of Subcarpathia numberedabout 93,000 and increased to 120,000 by 1910. This number included the county ofMaromaros, part of which became attached to Romania after World War I.WORLD WAR IThe outbreak of World War I in August of 1914 brought much suffering to the Jews ofSubcarpathia. Thousands were recruited into the Hungarian Army, disrupting familiesand communities. It is estimated that in World War I approximately 10,000 HungarianJewish soldiers were killed, about 1,000 of them from Subcarpathia. The Russianarmies which swept into Galicia caused a great number of Jews to cross the CarpathianMountains into Hungary. Ungvar, Munkacs and all other Jewish communities wereswollen with refugees. Another influx took place in 1916 when Jewish families tried toescape the Romanian troops that had broken into the southern part of Transylvania.The miseries of war increased even further when the Austro-Hungarian Empire col-lapsed in November of 1918.INTERREGNUM, 1918-1920The fighting in this region lasted deep into 1919. At first there was a short-livedHungarian republic under Count Mihily Kdrolyi. Later another Hungarian-Sovietrepublic under the Jewish dictator, Bela Klin. To eliminate these forces, Czech legion-aries were ordered into Ungvar and Beregszasz, just eight miles from Kaszony. InFebruary of 1919 Ukrainian Cossack bands under Petljura attempted to take overMunkacs together with other Subcarpathian territories. Their reputation as “Jew-killers” brought great fear to the Jews. The Jewish communities began to organizecivilian self-defense guards from the ranks of Jewish soldiers who had just returnedfrom service in the Hungarian Army. The Jewish guard met this crisis successfully.They waited for the invading bands at the railroad station in Munkacs, disarmed them,and chased them back to Galicia. Shortly after the attempted invasion by the Cossacks,Romanian troops entered Subcarpathia from the south and Czech troops from thewest. Finally after long negotiations in 1920 in Trianon, France, the victorious alliesdecided that Subcarpathia would become part of Czechoslovakia, except for thecounty of Maromaros which was divided between Romania and Czechoslovakia.101UNDER CZECHOSLOVAKIAN RULE, 1920-1938Immediately after the war, the Jews of Subcarpathia were concerned mainly withbinding up their wounds, with finding food and clothing for their families and medicalattention for their sick. Jewish relief efforts had been organized through the AmericanJewish Joint Distribution Committee (informally referred to as the “Joint”) whichopened an office in Munkacs. The kitchens of the American Relief Administration(ARA) could not be patronized by Jews because their food was not kosher.There was gradual starvation, people going virtually naked, and little employment.Tuberculosis, typhus and dysentery were rampant in the refugee-filled villages. Lackof soap and of sanitary facilities contributed to the spread of infectious diseases.Dr. M. Olkon, a Chicago physician, reported the following in 1920:. . This section (Subcarpathia) has 3,300 widows, 900 as a result of the war,2,000 whose husbands died of sickness and 400 where husbands are missing forthe past two years. There are 6,800 orphans of which 5,000 are fatherless, 1,000full orphans and 800 war orphans ...”From the economic and social aspects, the Jews’ situation was not substantiallydifferent from that of the rest of the population. In 1920 the “Joint” reported thefollowing professional distribution of the Jewish population:PROFESSIONFAMILIESINDIVIDUALSAgricultural workers, shepherds2,50012,500Village laborers, unskilled workers2,00010,000Wagoners1,2006,000Skilled workers (tailors, shoemakers,carpenters, tinsmiths)1,3806,900Tavern keepers1,1805,900Shop owners1,5007,500Businessmen9001,500Professionals (doctors, lawyers, engineers)200800Butchers100400Manufacturers100400Teachers (private Hebrew teachers)8004,00011,86055,900This survey accounts for approximately 60 percent of the population. The remaining 40 percenthad no definable source of income and must be put in the unemployed or unproductive column.As the Czech regime established itself, there was a great deal of improvement in allareas. Water supply and sewer systems were built in the major cities: Ungvar, Munkacs,Szftllbs and Beregszasz. Electrification was introduced not just in the large cities buteven in the villages. Kaszony was electrified in the late 1920s. Trade and the trans-portation of goods was developed with the “historic lands,” Bohemia and Moravia,which became the largest consumers of Subcarpathian agricultural products. By 1923*fourteen Jewish savings and loan associations had begun to function. Between 1924102and 1930 they received more than five million dollars in low interest loans from the“Joint,” a fact that helped greatly in the economic recovery, which was interruptedonly by the Great Depression which struck the area in the first half of the 1930s.During this period the Jews had rapidly adapted themselves to the democratic wayof life of the new Czechoslovakia. Jews were recognized as a separate “national minor-ity,” and became active politically. They took part in national and municipal electionsand even sent a deputy, Dr. Hayem Kugel, to the parliament in Prague,The Jewish population of Subcarpathia grew from 93,341 (15.39% of its totalpopulation) in 1921 to 102,542 (14.14%) in 1930, when they comprised 28.73% ofCzechoslovakian Jewry.Politically Jews were active in all parties: Communists, Socialists, Agrarians andHungarian Parties. But the Jewish Party received the strongest support. In fact, Dr.Kugel was elected to the Czech Parliament as the coalition candidate of the Social-Democrats and the Jewish Party.Education was another area of concern for the Jewish population as it progressed.Education was compulsory for all children from age six to age fourteen. But whichkind of education should a Jewish parent choose? The ultra-Orthodox were more con-cerned with Talmudic education than with anything else. Most of the Jewish boysstarted their Jewish education in the “Heder” at the age of three. When they reachedsix, they shared their time with the public schools. But which public school? Therewere several choices: Hebrew (wherever it was available), Czech, Hungarian, andRussian.The choice was not easy. The Hebrew Schools were Zionist influenced and thereforenot acceptable to the very orthodox. Czech was the language of Bohemia and Moravia,but was rarely spoken in Subcarpathia. The Hungarian language was associated with the“old regime,” and no higher education was available in this language. The same prob-lem faced those who wished to attend Russian schools: which Russian to learn? Sub-carpathian? Ukrainian? or Great Russian? The end result was that Jewish childrenattended all of the above mentioned schools.There were basically three types of specifically Jewish education available forJewish children: “Heders,” “Yeshivoth” and Hebrew Schools. A Heder was availableto the Jewish child in almost every town and village. Yeshivoth, however, were or-ganized in all major towns around a rabbi. The most important of the yeshivoth werein Ungvdr, Munkdcs, Beregszdsz, Szdllds, Hust, and last but not least in Kaszony.Thousands of “bahurim” attended these yeshivoth; a few of them continued theireducation in Bratislava (Pressburg), Budapest and even in Germany.Any discussion of Jewish education between World War I and World War II wouldbe incomplete without mentioning the secular Hebrew schools. The first Hebrewelementary school opened in Munkacs in 1920-1921. Many difficulties had to beovercome: lack of money, teachers, books and equipment and the fierce opposition ofthe Munkacser rabbi, Rabbi Spira, to any kind of “Zionist” education. In spite ofthese obstacles Hebrew elementary schools opened in Ungvar, Szdllds, Huszt, Torun,Jasina, Beregszasz, Voloc and in other places as well. Some of them soon closed be-cause of financial problems.The first Hebrew Gymnasium (high school) was opened in Munkacs in 1924, andanother in Ungvar in 1934. By 1932 1,000 pupils attended Hebrew public schools, outof approximately 13,000 Jewish children.103In 1938 and 1939 when the Hungarian Army returned to Subcarpathia, many ofthe schools continued to function, but their Hebrew content was greatly reduced.Most of the subjects had to be taught in the Hungarian language. The Holocaust ofthe Subcarpathian Jews in 1944 and the occupation of Subcarpathia by the RussianArmy in 1945 liquidated all Jewish education in the area.A Jewish press had also been highly developed in the area in four languages. Uj Szo(New Word) and Zsidd Ndplap (Jewish Popular Daily) in Hungarian, Yiddische Stimme(The Jewish Voice) in Yiddish, Zidovskd Zprdvy (Jewish News) in Czech, and MedinaIvrit (Jewish State) and Selbstwehr (Self-Defense) in German.THE HUNGARIAN RULE (1938-1944)Hungary has had a long history of anti-Semitism. Jews were always blamed for allthe ills of the country—poverty, capitalism, cosmopolitanism, communism, the defeatin World War I, etc. After World War I, in reaction to the communist regime of theJewish Bela Kun, the “White Terror,” carried out by army officers of Miklos Horthy,killed several thousand Jews. Already in 1920 Hungary had promulgated a law whichlimited the quota of Jewish university students to 6% (the “numerus clausus”).It must be said that among the leaders and intellectuals of Hungary were manyphilo-Semites, too, and Jews did attain high positions in government, commerce andcultural enterprises. But in bad times the hand of the anti-Semites always prevailed.Subcarpathia was re-occupied by the Hungarian Army in two phases: in November1938 when Ungvar, Munkacs, Beregszasz (including Kaszony) were occupied, in ac-cordance with the Treaty of Vienna, and in March of 1939 when the German Armyoccupied all Bohemia and Moravia. Shortly after their arrival anti-Jewish persecutionswere initiated. The “First Jewish Law” of 1938 limited to 20% the number of Jews inthe professions and in economic life. A few months later, in 1939, a “Second JewishLaw” was passed, further limiting Jews to 6% in the professions and economic life. Itincluded also all persons who had converted to Christianity after 1919. This law“increased” the number of “Jews” by approximately 100,000. Jews were dischargedfrom government positions, the legal professions, newspaper positions and jobs inentertainment. Thousands of commercial licenses were revoked; many Jewish familiesremained without a means of livelihood. In August of 1941 a “Third Jewish Law” waspromulgated. This law was clearly based on the infamous Nuremberg Laws of 1935; itprohibited marriages between Jews and non-Jews.But all this was just the beginning. With Hungary’s entry into the war against theRussians in 1941, approximately 35,000 so-called “alien Jews,” those who could notprove Hungarian citizenship, were rounded up and interned. About 20,000 of them,mostly from Subcarpathia, were deported across the border to Galicia, where theywere taken over by the Germans. In September of 1941 approximately 14,000 to16,000 were cold-bloodedly massacred in Kaments-Podolsk by German SS units,Ukrainian militiamen and Hungarian troops. (See page 17.)In 1940 the Hungarian Parliament passed the “Labor Service Law.” Under thislaw, Jews were discharged from the regular army and transferred to Jewish LaborUnits, actually forced labor units. All males, 21 and older, were subject to a minimumof two years service. In reality most of them served until the end of the war. At first104these units were mainly engaged in building railroads and bridges, unloading freight inrailyards, maintaining airfields, etc. In the beginning they were dressed in uniforms butwith a yellow ribbon around their arms. Later the uniforms were taken away; only theHungarian army hat and the yellow ribbon, now on their civilian clothing, remained.The treatment of the Jewish forced laborers was not uniform; it all depended on thehighest officers in charge of those units. Unfortunately most of them were criminals.In 1942 the Second Hungarian Army, about 200,000 men, under the command ofGeneral Gustdv J4nyi, a Nazi-sympathizer and Jew-hater, was sent to the RussianFront. Approximately 50,000 Jews were attached to this unit. The Second HungarianArmy was almost completely destroyed by the Russians in January of 1942, nearVoronezh. Only about 60,000 of the 200,000 front-line forces survived. Whatever wasleft of them started a long march back to the Hungarian border. The long march, whichlasted about two years, was filled with Jewish sufferings and martyrdom. (Page 18)Other sad chapters of this infamous period were written in Budapest and in otherparts of Hungary, but the framework of this summary is too narrow to include them.THE HOLOCAUST YEARS OF SUBCARPATHIAN JEWRY, 1944-1945The events of 1944 are generally well-known. The Germans had decided on the “FinalSolution” at the Wannsee Conference held on the outskirts of Berlin in January of1942.From that time on, the Nazis pushed the Hungarian government to cooperate. TheHungarians, however, would have preferred to wait with the “resettlement” of theJews until after the war. The Nazis, on the defensive on all fronts, occupied Hungaryon March 19, 1944, a fatal day for Hungarian Jewry. Two days later Eichmann and hisSS henchmen were in Budapest.At that time, the number of Hungarian Jews still totaled 760,000, of whom 232,000lived in Budapest and about 100,000 in Subcarpathia.The Germans found plenty of collaborators among the anti-Semites of Hungary,whose members made up the new German-inspired government. One “Jewish Law”followed the other. Jews were deprived of all civil rights. They were not allowed totravel and they had to wear a yellow star on their garments at all times. Shopping wasrestricted to a few hours a day; their ration of food was reduced to a minimum.On April 7, 1944 a decision was reached to place the Jews in ghettos. Subcarpathia,where approximately 100,000 Jews lived, was declared the first “operational zone.”Jewish ghettos were established in Ungvdr, Munkdcs, Beregszdsz, Nagysz6116s and Hust.The Jews of Kaszony were taken to the brick factory in Beregszdsz.The Jews of Subcarpathia were rounded up on the first day of Passover by theHungarian police and gendarmerie with the collaboration of Eichmann’s Sonderkom-mandos. They were aroused in the early morning hours, given only a few minutes topack bundles: two sets of underwear and shirts and a 14-day supply of food, not toexceed 50 kilograms (about 110 pounds). At the local synagogue, with beatings andterrorization, they were deprived of all valuables, money, jewelry, etc. before theirtransfer into the ghettos.In the ghettos the conditions were deplorable. They were forced to build their ownshacks from scraps of wood. Sanitation facilities and drugs for the sick were non-exis-tent. There was no milk for the children. Able-bodied men were taken to unload trains,105to clean the streets under degrading conditions and constant beatings. In Munkdcs ona Sabbath, a group of Orthodox Jews was given the assignment of destroying the inte-rior of the Great Synagogue. They were constantly and brutally searched by guardsfor '‘hidden treasures.” If something was found, the punishment was a cruel beating oreven death.The deportations began on the 15th day of May, 1944. The day before, hospitalpatients, newborn babies, the blind, the deaf, the mentally ill and even prison inmateswere transferred to the ghettos. At the railroad station, after an additional search, allwere packed into cattle cars, SO to 100 per car, without adequate sanitary provisions.The trains left on a two-day journey to Auschwitz, Poland.In Auschwitz, the Jews of Subcarpathia were “processed” in the well-known manner:the old, the very young, the sick and all who were unfit for work were immediatelysent to the gas chambers by the infamous Mengele and his SS staff. The rest, who sur-vived two or three months in Auschwitz, were sent to factories all over Germany asslave laborers under horrible conditions until the end of the war.The extermination of approximately 600,000 Hungarian Jews, including approx-imately 80,000 from Subcarpathia, was accomplished in less than a year by the Ger-man Nazis, although the Hungarian Fascists cooperated fully in this “Final Solution.”106906439Sworn'Affidavit by RUDOLPH (REZSO) KASZTNER, Former Head ofthe Budapest Rescue Committee2605-PSCHAPTER 10AN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONYABOUT THE DESTRUCTIONOF THE HUNGARIAN JEWRY(FROM THE NUREMBERG TRIALS)DR.

The decision to exterminate the Jewswas probably reached in 1941, In the occupied Baltic countries andin the Ukraine the SS-formation working jpintly with the t/ehrmachtannihilated nearly all Jews (in the Baltic countries they werehelped by the Latvians and Lithuanians). The mass-murder was carriedout with the aid of bullets. The victims often dug their own tombs*Frequently they were buried alive* Then began the use of gas. Thevictims were killed by gas bursting out Inside her emetic ally sealedlorries.In the faL 1 of 1941 - according to a statement of TTlsllozeny -made to me in January: 1945 in Vienna - Kaltenbrunner commissioned# »117917• 12 -SS-StaDd&rtenftliirer EL obi to work out the plan of the gas chanbers. Inthe opinion of Wisliozeny the initiative came from Aichmann.

"Victory is ours* declared Aichmann# "The end of the waris near* Yte must hurry as this is the last chance to free Europe ofthe ^ews# After the war it will not be possible to utilize suchmethods#"Wisliozeny claims that he interjected the following remark toAichmann1 s statement: "God help us that this method should never bepossible against us#*Krumey confirmed this statement of Y/isliczeny* He maintainedthat until the secret - which had to be kept strictly - was not re-vealed by Aichmann, some of the officers of IV,B. knew anythingabout it.The entire machinery of the German State supported Section TV.B.in this work.

The particular Officer of IV.B. who direc-ted the deportations from some particular country had the authorityto indicate whether the train should go to a death cas^p or not, andwhat should happen to the passengers. The instructions were usuallycarried by the SS-NCO escorting the train. The letters "A"* or "M*on the escorting instruction documents indicated Ausohwitz (Oswieolm)or Majdanek; it meant that the passengers were to be gassed*In case of doubt instructions by wire were asked from Aichmannin Berlin*Regarding Hungarian ^ews the following general ruling was laiddown in Oswiecim: children up to the age of IB or 14, older peopleabove 50, as well the sick, or people with criminal recoils (who weretransported in specially marked wagons) were taken immediately ontheir arrival to the gas chambers*The others passed before an SS-doctor who, on sight. Indicatedwho was fit for work, and who wes not. Those unfit were sent to thegas-chambers, while the others were distributed in various labor-camps.In September 1944 Slovakian partisans engineered a rewit inBanska-Bystrlcza. The Jewish youth joined the revolution enthusiasti-cally. Aichmann thereupon sent SS-Hanptsturmfdhrer Brunner to Bra-tislava with instructions to deport all the 17,000 odd Jews stillleft behind efter the deportations of 1943. They were to 60 toOswiecim*SS and HI ink a-Guard s arrested the Jews.

Vitezka98 reply was*"Aa far as I am concerned I will agree readily if I get telegraphioauthority from Kaltenbrunner to this effect.* Becker said on 2 Bo*vember 1944, in the Hotel Walhalla, St.Gallen, Switzerland, in thepresence of the representative of the Joint D.C.:"We have militarilyannihilated the Slovakian Jews*"In the first half of November 1944 about 20,000 Jews were takenfrom ^feereslenstadt to Oswieoim and were gassed, on instructions fromAichmann. As far as I could ascertain this was the last gassing process*According to Becher* Himmler lssud instructions * on his advice*on the 25 November 1944 to dynamite al 1 the gas-chambers and cress*orla of Oswieclm. &e also issued a ban on further murdering of Jews.Wiallozeny confirmed the existence of such an order. Nut he main-tained that Aichmann sabotaged this order and was supported in this byIdler and Kaltenbrunner.Following the advance of the Russian Army it was necessary toevacuate the Polish and Silesian caiqps. Some of the Jewish prisonerswerefeent to Nergen-Belsen or other camps. Most of the Jews found inthese camps by the Allies arrived there either at the end of 1944 orat the beginning of 1945. Other Jews in the extermination camps wereshot, or were frozen dead on the way*There wane no mass-murders in the months preceding the Germansurrender but owing to starvation - due partly to the collapse of thsGerman transport system and the general lack of food - the sick andweakened Jews died by the thousands*After the fall of 1944 Himmler granted several, concessions. Thushe permitted the departure for Switzerland of 1,700 Hungarian Jewsdeported to Bergen-Belsen and also agreed to suspend the annihilationof the Jews of the Budapest ghetto. Himmler permitted the handingover to the Allies the Jews of Berg en-Bel sen and There si ens tadt withouta shot being fired, which eyes and eyes of his colleagues was12015 ®was such a generous and colo.ssal concession that ha certainly hopedsooe political concession in return. In the hope of establishingcontact v/ith the Allies glcml er made sooe concessions even withoutexpecting economic returns,. To* this desire of Himmler may be as-cribed the general prohibition dated 35 November 1944, concerningthe further killing of Jews, On 37 November 1944 3echer showed mea copy of Eimmler’s order on this subject.
