On the way out at nightwe used to chant together, “Baruch sheptarani, Meyer Hersh’s companyi, gehtaheim, hut a gute nacht” [go home, have a good night; see footnote 41]. After my barmitzvah was celebrated, on a Saturday, with a big crowd at the Tolner synagogue, Istudied Russian with Mordechai Novominsky, hoping to prepare for the gymna-sium examination.At the time of the Zelyoni pogrom, I was fifteen. We had previously dug ashelter, a trench out from our house, covered with boards and earth, reachedthrough a trapdoor in a closet floor. We hid in there, with candle light, but in themiddle of the day the Zelyoni Petlurists found the trapdoor and forced us out.One of the Petlurists ordered me to get him some of our fruit preserves, which Idid.

I found a group of neighbors had taken refuge in the commu-nity building which was also for baking matzos. They told me to lie dow'n, andthrew a blanket over me, to pretend, if the pogromists came in, that I was too sickto be moved.From Fa?iny Goodman:As a child I knew Dudi Leib Koppala’s, I knew Moishe Shoyl's [Diana Miller'smaternal and paternal grandfathers.] I knew Baruch Bernstein.

I remember the rope making industry, but only from flax,not from hemp.The 'Seimovtzes' were Yiddishists, arguing for a national assembly (Seim), forYiddish culture and autonomy in Russia. They and the Zionists were very opposedto each other. There were also “youth who disappeared.” A “youth who disap-peared” was understood to have gone off to join one or another group in the anti-Tsarist revolutionary underground.[Benjamin Goodman, her husband, transcribed for us a Yiddish manuscript, a few pagesof crumbling yellowed paper, written shortly after the Zelyoni pogrom, by another survivor,whose name is yiow missing from the document. Some extracts follow, in tran.slation.]Fnday, 5 of Av, nine in the morning: Transients passing through report that thePetlurist bandit Kozakov and his forces are six verst aw'ay.

On May 6, 1920, thirty were killed by the forces of Het-man Stepanyuk. On May 14 a Friday deadline was set for all Jews to depart. OnSaturday, twenty who had not managed to get away were seized and buried alive.(Reshumoth, page 321.)During the December 1919 Denikin pogroms, the Logvin family left their home(near the ‘Bess Medrash’) and hid in a decrepit hoval at the end of their street,hoping that its very poor condition would not attract attention. The pogromistscame nonetheless. Breaking in, they struck Shammai (Seymour) Logvin, then amere boy, on the head. He fell unconscious and bleeding. His grandmotherBlume Leah ran to help him, so she was seized and strung up by rope to the roofbeams. Meanwhile pogromists outside set fire to the roof thatch. In the confusionof flame and smoke the family managed to save both Blume Leah and Seymour,escaping out the back way. Blume Leah was, however, permanently blinded by theeffect of the hanging. (See the 1912 family photo in this volume).75. Detailed accounts of these events are readily available in the Jewish Ency-clopedia, Encyclopedia Judaica and other reference works.76. There were many eyewitness accounts published during and after theevents of 1919. Shtogrin was tried and executed by the Soviet authorities. See:Elias Heifetz, The Slaughter of the Jews in the Ukraine in 1919, New York, 1921; A.Tsherikover, and Pogroms in the Ukraine, Berlin, 1923 (in Yiddish).The Pogroms in the Ukraine under the Ukrainian Governments (1917-1920), publishedby the Committee of Jewish Delegations, 1927, page 111, cited testimony by S.Grinberg, S.

Translated it reads: Excerpt fromBirth Records. / In the first part of the birth record of Jews born in the townJustingrad, Lipovitsy county, under no. 8 for 1892 is recorded: 'On February 28,1892 a female child born, name Hudel; father David Lovin, of Sarny; motherBlume Leah.' This excerpt is issued for admission to school. This is an accurateexcerpt from the birth records. ” The signature and seal are of Sh.B. Shaporonskii,"state rabbi,” town of llkitsy, Lipovitsy county. This signature, by a semi- official,in another town, suggests that it could not be obtained in Justingrad at that time,March 15, 1909.Although all members of the family from the time of their arrival in the UnitedStates use the form Logvin, all papers we have seen dated before 1914 show Lovin,which was also the form inscribedfor David Lovin, as an official, on the fagade of‘Bess Medrash’.Sokolievka IJ us tin grad85newspapers in New York, in 1983 only weeklies remain. Rather as a nostalgicinheritance from grandparents, Yiddish literature is being taught now in a num-ber of universities, and there are several Yiddish theatrical productions mountedeach year in New York.69. In the title of this textbook, published in Warsaw, 1904, Jacob (Magnus)Krinsky described his as the “natural method.”70. These teachers were idealistic university students on vacation, trading les-sons for meals and lodging, seeking to effect a political awakening.Notice the first appearance of schooling for girls. Adella (Logvin) Feldstein hadtutors (including young women tutors) at home. Among her papers, after herdeath, was found her application form to enter a Russian school, which, howeverwas denied her. She kept it all her life, in a packet with keepsake photos given herby friends when she emigrated to America.71. From the first, the Zionist movement divided on ideological lines, some ofwhich persist to this day. These have included (among others) “general” Zionistsand “revisionist” Zionists, differing especially in tactics; “religious” Zionists and“labor” or “socialist Zionists”; and Zionists who preferred a cultural center ratherthan a nation-state. These trends have at different dates given rise to many differ-ent organizations. ‘Tz’ire Tzion’ means “Youth of Zion.” ‘Baalebatim’ has severalmeanings, here substantial householders and perhaps small employers. ‘Seimo-vtzim’ were a movement during and after the 1905 Revolution, which sought towin the right to hold elections for a legislative body (‘Seim’) to serve as a vehicle forquasi-national autonomy for the Jewish communities. Zashkov was a town nearSokolievka, to the north, whose families were closely related.72. These words of Rabbi Pinchas’l have reached us from a number of sourcesfar dispersed in time and location. They were surely deeply impressed on theminds of the local people.73. ‘Shabbos Chazon’ is the Sabbath when in the synagogue is read the fifthchapter of the vision (‘chazon’) of Yeshayahu (Isaiah). By the Gregorian calendarthat 6 of Av was August 2, and the massacre took place Sunday August 3. Theeyewitness account derives mainly from Yehudah Blank and Bennie Berkun.Reb Pinchas’l was seventy-six at the time he was murdered. The MashabeiSadeh booklet includes a Hebrew epitaph composed by his son-in-law RabbiYehoshua Heshil Rabinowitz, the Monastrishtsher Rebbe, in an acrostic based onhis name in Hebrew, which may be translated but not reproduced in English:“The Pride of his flock, the Crown of his congregation, the Sage among theProdigies, the Symbol of Reverence.”74. The account of the Denikin atrocities is partly based on the testimony ofJoseph Zilberg, published in Reshumoth (in Hebrew) edited by A. Drujanow,Berlin, 1923. To escape the atrocities committed during Denikin’s retreat, some ofthe survivors fled to nearby Zashkov, where the nearby Ukrainians demanded thebanishment of these refugees as a price of continued “toleration” of the Jews ofZashkov, a “toleration” which had been bought by paying them off No sooner had84Sokolievka /J us tin grad62. Jewish synagogues and houses of worship are each entirely independent,not subject to any higher authority. Tolna and Kontakozov Chassidim were fol-lowers of Chassidic rabbis based in or originating in those towns. The ‘BessMedrash’ and the ‘Shulech’ls’ were probably not Chassidic, but not necessarilyactively of the ‘misnagid’ persuasion.The Feldstein family attended the 'Folner synagogue. The Logvin familyfavored the ‘Bess Medrash’ which was near their home.63. But women and men sat separately, with a curtain or screen or balcony ofseparation. Nowadays, depending on the branch of Judaism followed, this divi-sion may vary from traditional to none at all.64. Town head: This is not clear. Local government officials were not Jewish inTsarist Russia. Jewish communities voluntarily taxed themselves for communalpurposes, and chose communal officers for these. A ‘chevra’ was any association,ranging from any amorphous group assembled for a single purpose to a formallyconstituted organization with officers and treasury. ‘Bikur-cholim’ means “visit-ing the sick.” ‘Gmilas-Chassadim’ means “fulfilling righteousness.”65. “Called a doctor,” a questionable recollection for most of these years; attimes, a recent graduate might practice there for a short time. The ‘rofeh’ called inwas more likely a ‘feldsher,’ a barber-surgeon who did cupping. In this proceduresmall one ounce cups of heavy glass were emptied of oxygen by inserting a flamingwadding soaked in alcohol, so that the partial vacuum made the cup adhere to theskin of the back or chest, and produced a circular patch of reddened skin lastingseveral days. The thought may have been to extract the humours causing the ill-ness. The practice was still in use among immigrants to the United States until the1930’s. We have inherited two sets of these ‘bankes’ (cups) from the Feldsteins andfrom the Millers. Chicken soup: the infallible remedy for all illnesses in the shtetl.66. ‘Apikoros’, (from Epicurus), an agnostic, or anvone who might be ques-tioning tradition.67. ‘Maskir, an intellectual, non-traditional but still Hebrew and Jewish-oriented. Since no meat or poultry would be used unless it had been rituallyslaughtered by \h.€: shochet, that post was likely to mean relative affluence as well asprestige.68. In the East European shtetl, Hebrew was the “holy language,” reserved forritual and worship, whether in the synagogue or the home. The vernacular fordaily conversation and business was Yiddish, which in the latter half of the nine-teenth century also became the language of popular printed literature and thetheatre. Fhe Zionist movement disdained Yiddish asy/irgow, and revived the use ofHebrew as a living language, so that it has become such in daily life in Israel (with amodernized vocabulary added). The Holocaust wiped out the Jewish populationsin the regions where Yiddish predominated, and post-revolutionary conditions inRussia have further restricted its use. In the United States, the relative freedom ofaccess to national culture and economic life led to rapid Americanization of theYiddish-speaking immigrants. Where in the I920’s there were four daily YiddishSokolievka Ijustingrad83so that my mother used to always express surprise when I came home from syna-gogue with my “bouquet” intact. (L.M.)55. Simchas Torah flags: Simchas Torah, Rejoicing in the Torah, marks theconclusion of the annual cycle of re-reading the Five Books of Moses in thesynagogue, and the beginning of the new cycle. Duringthe evening and the morn-ing service, the scrolls of the Torah are carried processionally around the syna-gogue, and children follow, carrying paper banners, often decorated by litho-graphed pictures. The ‘aliyah’ is an honorary “going up” to the dais where theTorah portion of the week, or of the holiday, is being read, subdivided into seven(at times, more) parts, allowing for an equal number of worshippers to have thehonor to recite the blessings for this reading. Except on Simchas Torah, one musthave attained Bar Mitzvah age for this honor. (Reform synagogues now accord the‘aliyah’ to women as well as men, but this was unknown in Sokolievka.)56. ‘A1 Ha-Nissim’ explains the occasion for the holiday, and ‘Ma’oz Tzur’ is avery beautiful Chanukah hymn. ‘Latkes’ are a species of potato pancakes servedhot, and when traditionally fried in chicken fat, have a rare flavor such as cannotbe conveyed by the word “pancake.” In the cold climate of Eastern Europe, theywere enjoyed as they hardly can be in today’s well-heated homes.57. In many shtetls, Purim was celebrated with masquerade costumes, and byperformances of amateur comic street plays, although apparently not in Justin-grad.58. The nostalgic idealization of Passover from childhood memories has itsbasis in fact, but for adults it was also a season of fear and trembling, because it wasa preferred season for anti-Jewish incitements and violence, such as the 1903Kishinev pogrom.To enforce the ban on ‘chometz’ (non-Passover foods), in commemoration ofthe hasty exit from ancient Egypt by the Jewish slaves who had time only to pre-pare matzos, special pots and dishes were reserved for use at Passover time only.The “four cups” of wine are the number prescribed for use during the ‘seder’. The‘afikoman’ is a piece of matzo which the person conducting the ‘seder’ sets aside(“hides”) at the beginning, which is intended to be “stolen” by one of the children,who collects a reward or forfeit as price for restoring it at the end. Whatever was itsorigin, it serves as a device to keep little children awake during the rather longevening proceedings. ‘Choi Ha-Moed’ is the period between the first and last daysof Passover (and also of Succos), which are ordinary working days. Nut games:filberts and such, used like marbles.59. See note 43 above.60. Boundary days: see Exodus 19:12.61. On the seventeenth day of Tammuz the walls of Jerusalem were breachedby the Babylonian forces and on Tisha B’Av the Temple burned. During thesethree weeks, pious Jews dispense with certain pleasures and conveniences, as dur-ing the mourning for a close relative.82 ^ okolievka /] ustingrad47. The domineering father: individual personal reminiscence seems to haveslipped in here, likewise with the mother later.48. The memoir distinguishes between ‘rebbe’, traditional ‘Siddur-and-Chumash’ tutor, and ‘moreh,’ teacher of secular subjects.49. Keinehora: Yiddish usage has many stock phrases to ward off ill fortunewhen mentioning names of people. This one is a colloquial slurring of Yiddish‘kein’ (‘let there not be’) and Hebrew ‘ayin hara’ (‘the evil eye’). Tnach is thestandard abbreviation for the Hebrew Scriptures. Esav: Although Esau’s conduct,by modern standards, was in important respects highly com.mendable, obviouslythe ‘cheder’ taught children to contemn him, for reasons too complex to exploreherre. Hence the choice of the name Yitzchak, Jacob’s father’s name, rather thanthe name of Jacob’s twin brother Esau. ‘Chayyim’ means “life.” ‘Hadassah’ is analternate name for Biblical Esther.50. Erom our observation, children of all nations in Europe today are expectedto be silent in the presence of their elders. In the Passover service in the home, the‘seder,’ the youngest child is called upon to open the proceedings by asking the“four questions.”51. Honey was spread on the bread by way of mimetic magic to sweeten the newyear. ‘Tashlich’ is Hebrew for “thou shalt cast away” (thy sins), and is the namegiven to a religious service held in the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah while standingin the open at the brink of a body of running water. ‘Kappores,’ plural of‘kapporah,’ literally scapegoat or atonement, were (and still are, where the prac-tice continues) live chickens brought home by the mothers, and swung over thechildren’s heads with an informal but traditional mother’s prayer that the life ofthe chicken (implicitly, a sacrifice) should secure the life of the child. This rite wasstill performed by my grandmother over us children, in Brooklyn in the 1920’s,leaving an unforgettable memory of cackling tumult and flying feathers. (L.M.)52. Children under thirteen were not required to abstain from food in the YomKippur fast, which lasts about twenty-seven hours, but they vied with each other tosee how long each could hold oul. Ne'ilah'. Awesome as was Kol Nidre, the openinglines chanted on Yom Kippur eve, even more awesome and even dread, was thefinal closing hour of Ne’ilah at dusk of the next day, the time of the last appeal forforgiveness and for life.53. Succos begins five days after Yom Kippur. It is customary to eat dinner in atemporary shack, with a roof that can be only partially covered, the ‘sukkah,’commemorating the temporary shelters used in the desert in the Exodus fromEgypt towards the Promised Land.54. Eor reasons obscure to me, during the morning service on Hoshana Rabba,it was customary to hold small bundles of leafy twigs, about eight or ten incheslong, bound with twine, and beat them against the prayer stands or against theback of the seat in front of one, till the leaves fell off, and the twigs were discarded.I never understood why, and, as a child, it offended my sense of caring for plants.Sokolievka /] ustingrad8140. ‘Shalom Zachar,’ means “greeting to the male”; also called a ‘Ben Zachar,’ “amale child.” “Heis arbis,” chickpeas cooked and peppered, served hot (or cold,despite the name) are positively addictive; a pity they are being forgotten.41. ‘Baruch sheptarani’ is a play on the words of the formula recited by a fatherat his son’s Bar Mitzvah, “Blessed be He who has freed me” (i.e., from responsibil-ity for his son’s deeds; from age thirteen he is responsible for his own behavior.)42. Ducklings: the actual word was the Yiddish ‘katshkelech,’ also so used inSholem Aleichem’s story, Shir Ha-Shirim. ‘Motzi’: Observant Jews have a large rep-ertory of formal blessings, thanking God for many different reasons. The mostfrequent is this blessing over bread, blessed be He who brings forth (‘motzi’) breadfrom the earth.43. Lulav: long, narrow palm leaf spear clusters, bound with myrtle and willowtwigs, held in the hand together with a citron (‘esrog’) in Succos holiday rituals.Chanukah has always been more of a folk holiday than a solemnity, and inno-cent “gambling,” for dry beans instead of money, has always been a standard chil-dren’s game. Depending on the alphabet letter engraved on each of its four side,the way the ‘dreidef falls as it stops spinning determines “winnings” and “losses”of beans.Bow and arrow: Lag B’Omer means the thirty-third day in the count of forty-nine days between Passover and Shevuos. The observance relates to theunsuccessful uprising against Roman rule led by Bar Kochva, about 131-135, andsupported by the martyred Rabbi Akiva. According to one tradition. Lag B’Omermarks one day in which Rabbi Akiva’s pupils won a victory, in what was a longseries of defeats. This tradition seems to have been bowdlerized by some later rab-bis (who, for reasons both good and bad, wanted to play down the idea of armedstruggle) into a story that a plague raging among Akiva’s students ceased on thatday. Further tradition says that when the uprising was crushed. Rabbi ShimonBen Yocha’i, disciple of Akiva, hid in a cave for many years. His pupils came toconsult him, surreptitiously, and they carried bows and arrows in case they had todefend themselves against a stray Roman patrol. (To me, this tradition of an out-ing into the woods, continued into modern times, connected with archery and apilgrimage to a cave, suggests roots with affinities to Stone Age hunters gatheringfor rituals at caves like Lascaux and Altamira. (L.M.)Wooden sword at Tisha B’Av: a custom not known to us from other sources.44. Chanukah gelt: gifts, of a few small coins, given to children by adult rela-tives and friends. ‘Gelf simply means ‘money.’45. The word in the Mashabei Sadeh text is dlaat, translating some Yiddishword, but we are not certain which Yiddish word, or what vegetable used inSokolievka it stood for, squash, pumpkin, or whatever.46. Ox goring cow: This refers to a well-known discussion in the Talmud,treating of negligence causing claims for damages. Sholem Aleichem somewherewrote of the ‘cheder’ pupil who said pathetically, “If an ox gores a cow, I getslapped.”80Sokolievka /] ustingradHebrew words used on different occasions connote “buttermilk,” “sour cream,” or“yogurt.” Tomatoes (next page): Adella Feldstein told us she never saw one till shecame to America.35. ‘Klei Kodesh’ is an ironical term, which may be translated somewhat as“Holy Pots and Pans.” The use here suggests something of an anti-clerical tend-ency from the early 1900’s. The ‘chazzan’ chants the liturgy, and both vocal abilityand individual artistry were and still are highly prized. A ‘Ba’al Korei’, or masterreader, was a man skilled in reading from the Torah scrolls, which have no vowels,only consonants, and require practically knowing the Pentateuch by heart.‘Badchonim’ were not synagogue personnel but professional jesters, skilled intossing off extemporaneous rhymed patter. A ‘Dayan’ is a judge, making rulingsunder Jewish law. The communal bathhouse was a major social center as well as ahygienic facility, in the absence of running water plumbing in the home. Theremust also have been a ‘mikveh,’ serving the same functions for the women, as wellas a bathhouse, adjacent to the Rabbi’s synagogue.About ‘melamdim’ between 1910 and 1918, Seymour Logvin writes: “My first‘cheder melamed’ was .Mayer Hersh der Royter, so called from his fiery red beard.He was very strict with the pupils, and would use a ‘kontshik,’ a leather strap. Thenext was Benny der Shtimmer, so called because he talked through his nose. Mymother took us out of his ‘cheder’ w hen we began to talk the same w'ay. Then westarted with Mordechai Novominsky. He was a modern teacher, of Hebrew , Yid-dish and Russian. We had one more whose name I cannot remember, also a mod-ern teacher, but then started the pogroms.”His younger brother Irving Logvin adds, on the ‘kontshik’: “My pet dog used tosit and wait for me at the door all day. The ‘m.elamed’ knew' that all I had to do waswhistle the dog in, so we had a stand-off.”36. To the despotic Tsars, any religious leader whose appeal was as authorita-tive as that of a Chassidic rabbi w as considered eligible for even greater persecu-tion than what might be the lot of any ordinary rabbi.37. ‘Matzah sh’murah’: Baking of matzos for Passover is always done undervery special conditions, using specially reserved utensils, and select flour (onlyflour and water are used), to make sure that there would be no “contamination”from contact w'ith utensils or materials used during the rest of the year. ‘Sh’mu-rah’, meaning “guarded,” indicates very very special.38. Our interviews w ith octogenarian survivors confirms that in Justingrad andBuki homes were often larger than in manv other shtetlach, where one and tworooms w'ere not uncommon.39. Vilna Ga’on: Ga’on is an honorific title given to some rabbis, as “the great” isattached to some names of kings. Eliyahu (Ben Shlomoh) Zalman, 1720-1797, wasthe most influential rabbi of the ‘.Misnagdim’, relentlessly opposing the Chassidim.He is remembered to this day not by his name but simply as “the Vilna Ga’on”. Hispicture in a home would signify a ‘Misnagid’ tendency there.Sir Moses Montefiore (1784-1885) was a famous British Jewish philanthropistactive in defense of oppressed Jews in the Turkish Empire and elsewhere.S okolievka /J ustingrad19he had been betrothed by his father to the daughter of the Rabbi Shmuel Abba ofSlavita. The marriage took place in 5591 (1831), and until 5599 (1839) he lived inhis father-in-law’s household, continuing his studies. At the end of 5599 hereturned to Linitz as rabbi and ‘maggid’ (preacher). Despite the pleas of that com-munity that he stay there, in 5612 (1852) he decided that he was called to serve thethen tiny community at Justingrad. He continued there for sixteen years, vener-ated by many thousands of Chassidim in the Kiev and Kherson gubernias. Thispopularity aroused the hostility of the Tsarist regime, which feared any develop-ment not under its control, and an order was issued deporting him to Yaroslav.Alerted in time, on the eve of the Sukkos holiday 5628 (1868) he fled just twohours before the Tsarist police came to his house. As a pious Jew, he hid the firsttwo days of the holiday with a nearby family, then escaped to Romania, where helived in Padilavi for ten years, dying at 63 in 5638 (1878). A posthumous book,Chen Aharon, published his thoughts. His son Pinchas took over his Sokolievkapost. He had three other sons who were rabbis and seven daughters, all wives ofrabbis.Shmuel Abba’s family name was Shapiro, and his daughter’s name was Bayla.30. During 1917-1921, the Ukraine was ravaged by a many-sided series of“civil” wars, until firm control was finally established by the Moscow Soviet regime.Short-lived “governments” were repeatedly proclaimed by competing cliques ofUkrainian nationalists seeking to seize power in an independent Ukraine: thesewaged war against Moscow and against each other. There were campaigns foughtagainst the central Soviet forces and against Ukrainian nationalists by “whiteguard” armies, such as those commanded by Anton Ivanovich Denikin, whoaimed to restore the unified Russian empire of the Tsarist era. There were inva-sions by the armies of the newly restored Polish state, and by interventionist expe-ditions from France and Britain. Many irregular forces operated under various“revolutionary” slogans, of many shades.Daniel Terpilo, using the name Zeleny (pronounced Zelyoni), was ataman of2,500 or more irregulars, and, in between carrying out mass murders in Jewishcommunities, took sides against the Bolsheviks and against anti-Bolshevik Ukrai-nian nationalists at various times. At least forty bloody pogroms were perpetratedunder his command.31. Eruv; Under the rabbinical interpretations of the kinds of labor forbiddenon the Sabbath day of rest, it was a debatable question as to whether the ban on“transporting” of items also limited what one might carry on one’s person. By set-ting up an ‘Eruv,’ the area enclosed by nominal boundaries was interpreted asbeing within one’s domicile, and this legal fiction simplified the issues.32. Gragers: noise makers, to drown out the name of Haman at the reading ofthe Book of Esther at Purim services, commemorating the defeat of this ancientattempt to wipe out the Jewish people.33. Bet Hamidrash Hagadol; the same as Wegodner’s ‘Bess Medrash’; ‘Haga-dol’ means “the big”.34. Buttermilk: One is never quite certain whether the particular Yiddish or18Sokolievka Ij ustingradther the physical punishment nor the medieval pedagogy in the ‘cheder’ everinhibited the traditional Jewish devotion for book learning. (In the Talmud Torahin Brooklyn which I attended from 1920 to 1925, no child was ever punished,physically or otherwise).25. Buki was a shtetl fifteen miles away. It still exists as a town today, but itsJewish population had to flee during the 1917-1920 pogrom era. Among thesewere the (originally Sokolievka) family of Abraham and Yocheved (Novominsky)Feldstein, at first to Uman, then to join a long settled Boston community of otherNovominsky kin from Buki.A Yiddish book on life in Buki, My Shtetl in Ukraina,w2LS published in New York,1921, by M. J. Novominsky, under his pen name M. J. Olgin. His brotherMordechai Novominsky (‘Mod’) taught pupils in Sokolievka, and during the1919 pogroms was murdered there together with his children.26. We have checked with several grandchildren of Levi Wegodner, but noneof them knows of any continuation beyond the point where the manuscript nowstops. The last sentence appears to refer to events in the Ukraine during the1880’s and 1890’s (since he and the closely related Cridens came to the UnitedStates long before the events of 1919): but we have found no written records forthose years in Sokolievka.The Mashabei Sadeh Memorial Book: Notes27. The booklet is 24.5 x 17.5 cm, hard-bound in heavy cardboard. It has abinder’s leaf; a frontispiece drawing, verso with a motto; title page, verso withcredit to Baruch Bernstein for his editorial work; text on pages 5 to 64 (some pagesblank), with 9 sketches by Abba Fenichel. On sixteen unnumbered pages are tabu-lated as many names of pogrom victims as could be gathered, 268, a list quiteincomplete; and 49 photographs of some of these and some of other related per-sons (including two American soldiers killed in American wars), and photos of sev-eral monuments.Pages 5 to 8 inclusive, and 63-64, deal with the details of the Kibbutz school chil-dren’s work on the project and its reception by Yad Vashem. These pages are nottranslated here, but are still available in the reproduction of the Hebrew text. Par-enthetical passages in the Hebrew relating to the mechanics of composition arealso not carried into the translation. Footnotes, where pertinent, are incorporatedinto the translation.We have translated the text very literally, in a few instances correcting thesequence of sentences or paragraphs, according to the need of an English version.Matter in parentheses are our clarifications of some technical details. Matter inbrackets, italicized, are our additions to the Mashabei Sadeh text.28. Among the emigrants to the United States, those who settled early in theBuffalo area used Sokolievka (in variant spellings) and Sokolovka. Early arrivals inthe New York area called themselves ‘Justingrader’ in their mutual aid lands-mannschaft, while later arrivals formed a “Sokolifker-Kenaler” organization.29. Gedalyahu Aharon Rabinowitz was born in Linitz in 5575 (1815). As a childSokolievka I Justingrad//Rav Shimshon is not otherwise identified by Wegodner, but perhaps refers toReb Yaakov Shimshon Chodorov, son-in-law to Gedalya Aharon, who lived for atime in Sokolievka.16. President of an American synagogue: Levi Wegodner allows himself a wrycomment, suggesting, inferentially, that a synagogue official in the “Old Country”would have known more than what the weekly calendar called to his attention.Note “three” fathers: probably not including the Rabbi Gedalyahu Aharon.17. Family surnames had generally come into current use among East Euro-pean Jews by the nineteenth century, but in ordinary shtetl conversation wererarely used. Nicknames were more common. These might refer to one’s trade(“Meyer the tinsmith”); to one’s appearance (“Lebele the lame”); or most often, toa relative. “David Chayyim’s” means “David the son of Chayyim,” “GedalyaElyakum’s” was “Gedalya son of Elyakum.”18. Konela: by American survivors also spelled Canella, Kenaler, etc., a muchsmaller community, not far from Sokolievka. Its emigrants joined the Sokolievkasocieties, not founding their own.19. A ‘prizba’ was a low embankment, protecting the base of the house. ‘Min-cha-maariv’: evening services in the synagogue, ‘mincha’ about sundown, ‘maariv’at dark. ‘Shofar’: a horn, usually from a ram, but could be from a goat, ancientlyused like a bugle, still sounded as part of the liturgy in the synagogue on HighHolidays.20. In Genesis 22 is told how Abraham was ready to sacrifice his son Isaac on analtar in obedience to his God, but since his devotion was clear, a ram was substi-tuted instead. This story, in its peculiar fashion, may have been composed amongthe ancient Hebrews to justify their abolition of the practice of human sacrifice,especially of children, common to their neighbors, and perhaps common to someof their ancestors. (L.M.)21. Mordechai the Rov is not otherwise identified here, but may have been the‘dayan’, or judge by Jewish law, also called Reb Mot’l, attached to the household ofReb Pinchas’l.22. Goy: the Jewish townsfolk lived side by side with their non-Jewish neigh-bors in worlds apart. A ‘goy’ was simply one of the “other” people. It is not of itselfpejorative, but too often the context of events has made it so.23. ‘May he be the kapporah’: Anciently the ‘kapporah’ was a ritual scapegoat,an animal sacrificed to atone for sin. The phrase is equivalent to “may he go toHell” — literally, not metaphorically.24. ‘Nebbish’ has passed into American colloquially for a pitiful person.‘Leren’, the verb, and ‘lernen’, the noun, do not mean simply “to learn’ or “stud-ying.” The Talmud (‘Gemara’) is a compilation of debates and opposing views onmany matters. The commentaries printed with it supply more dissents andcontroversies, often with very fine distinctions. ‘Lernen’ therefore means rumi-nating, analysing, and returning again and again to the same issues. Somehow nei-76Sokolievka /Justingradthe ‘kaddish’ ritual in memory of his parents after their demise. ‘Meitkelech’, forundershorts, is a diminutive from ‘meitkes’, trousers, but ‘penselech’ seems to bean Americanism derived from ‘pants’.‘Arba-kanfos’: in Numbers 15:38-40, the Children of Israel were instructed towear ‘tzitzis,’ knotted strings, or fringes, on the four corners (‘arba kanfos’) of theirgarments as a constant reminder of their religious faith and duties. Accordingly,observant Jewish men, as a symbol of this constant awareness, wear a garment(more often, an undergarment) consisting of an oblong cloth, with an opening togo over the head and neck, like a bib covering front and back, with the ‘tzitzis’ ateach of the four corners. ‘Arba-kanfos’ is the Hebrew name for this under-garment, which in colloquial Yiddish is called a ‘leib-tzu-dekel,’ (“body covering”).When worn as an outer or publicly visible garment, it is called a ‘tallis-katan,’ (smalltallis, tallis being the large prayer scarf or shawl worn by men during the syna-gogue service; plural, ‘talleisim’). ‘Yarmelka’: a small skull-cap, worn indoors, byobservant Jewish males, covering the head as a sign of awe and devotion before theomnipresent deitv.11. Xebech: an interjection, “the poor thing.” To read the krias-sh’ma, in thiscontext is ironic (‘krias-sh’ma’ is the recital of the Creed at bed-time); here, “toread the Riot Act.” ‘Nagid,’ a man with status because of being somewhat better offfinancially than the shtetl average; ‘nagidish,’ the adjective; ‘nagidishe,’ pluralform. Gemara: the Talmud.12. Gedalyahu .Aharon, Shimshon; see notes 16 and 29 below. ‘Shochet,’ theritual slaughterer of meats and poultry, from the religious point of view a statusposition in the community. ‘Gabai’: a synagogue official, a trustee. These fellowpupils indicate that Levi’s father, with his general store, did have status in thetown. Stavitsher: a recent arrival from the shtetl Stavitsh (Stawiscze), north fromSokolievka.Yaakovka was the youngest son of R. Gedalyahu Aharon, and grew up to berabbi in Cherkass.13. ‘Bova Nfetzia’: commonly the first tractate in the Talmud studied by begin-ners. It deals with disputes arising from conflicting claims to personal, movablepropert). The passage which supplied the nicknames was probably not the veryfirst lesson, as it is somewhat after the beginning of the tractate. Wegodner’stranscription, which I follow in the English, reflects the local pronunciation of thepassage. ‘Kohen’ means a descendant of the ancient priestly caste of Temple days.‘Lekesh’ suggests a rather silly fellow. Abba the Kohen of Bardala and ShimonBen Lakish (Resh Lakish) were expounders of forah and Mishna in the third cen-tury.14. ‘Bukser’ is the dried fruit of the carob, also called St. John’s Bread, whichflourishes in Israel and Crete. Children chewed it for its sweetness, and being oftough fiber, it takes a long time to chew and yield its sweets. It is associated with thefestive day of Chamisho Osor B’Shvat (Fifteenth of Shvat).15. ‘Sholem Aleichem’, “peace be with you,” or equivalent to “How do you do”as a greeting. (Not to be confused with the great Yiddish author who used that as apen name).Sokolievkaljustingrad75the orders were to drive them to Perm, then there was a change and we are drivingthem to Kazan. I have taken them over a hundred versts. The officer who handedthem over said it was dreadful, and that’s all about it; a third were left on the way”(and the officer pointed to the earth). “Not half will reach their destination,” headded.“Have there been epidemics or what?” I asked, deeply moved.“No, not epidemics, but they just die off like flies. A Jew boy, you know, is such afrail, weakly creature, like a skinned cat; he is not used to tramping in the mud forten hours a day and eating dried bread — then again, being among strangers, nofather nor mother nor petting; well, they cough and cough until they cough them-selves into their graves. And I ask you, what use is it to them? What can they dowith little boys?”I made no answer.“When do you set off? I asked.“Well, we ought to have gone long ago, but it has been raining so heavily. . . .Hey, you there! Tell the small fry to form up.”They brought the children and formed them into regular ranks: it was one ofthe most awful sights I have ever seen, those poor, poor children! Boys of twelve orthirteen might somehow have survived it, but little fellows of eight and ten.. . . Nopainting could reproduce the horror of that scene.Pale, exhausted, with frightened faces, they stood in thick, clumsy, soldiers’overcoats, with stand-up collars, fixing helpless, pitiful eyes on the garrison sol-diers who were roughly getting them into ranks. The white lips, the blue ringsunder their eyes looked like fever or chill. And these sick children, without care orkindness, exposed to the icy wind that blows straight from the Arctic Ocean, weregoing straight to their graves.Memoirs of Alexander Herzen, chapter 13, translated by Constance Garnett.7. Obviously the family had migrated from Berdichev, which was a major Jew-ish center. In 1899 it had 50,000 Jews out of a total population of 62,000.8. This brother, known as “Fetter Froyim” (Uncle Ephraim), was well known tome as a child in Brooklyn. His son, Isidore Wegodner, was a survivor of the terri-ble Triangle factory fire (1911), in which the heavy loss of life was a spark whichstimulated the successful labor union organization of the needle trades workers inNew York (D.F.M.)9. To ‘daven’ is to recite, or participate, in the recital, of the set liturgy, con-sisting of psalms, piyyutim (post-Biblical religious poetry) and other ritual texts.These rituals for weekdays. Sabbaths and holy days fill several volumes, butobservant Jews, by dint of frequent repetition, can often recite much, or evenmost, from memory. We here use ‘davenin’ for the noun, ‘davening’ for the pres-ent participle. (Pronounce the a as in art, the e as in mother). Kiddush, the blessingover wine, is a ceremony to distinguish the start of the Sabbath or of a major holi-day from ordinary working days.10. The large size of Meierka’s ‘cheder’ suggests that it may have been acommunity, rather than an individual melamed’s, enterprise. Kaddishlech: pluralof‘kaddish’l,’ an affectionate word for a male child, who would grow up to recite74S okolievka I Justin grad‘Chuinash,’ the Five Books of Moses. A ‘bahelfer,’ or ‘beihelfer,’ was usually anolder teen-aged youth, serving as teacher’s classroom aide, and as escort foryounger children to and from the ‘cheder.’ The ‘Bess Medrash’ (local pro-nunciation), literally “House of Exegetics,” was a community building, servingboth as a house of worship and as a center for adult study circles conning Mishnah,Talmud and other advanced studies.5. ‘Bakalevena,’ groceries, and ‘galanterie,’ fancy goods, must be understood inthe content of the 186()'s, referring to spices and notions not locally produced, at atime when most foodstuffs and household goods were local products, and not soldthrough middlemen. Apparently Levi Wegodner's uncritical respect for hisfather s acumen, a respect typical of that age, was not affected by his recollectionsof what actually happened.6. The ‘chappers’ and Nicolai's “cantonists” (draftees): Many years later, as lateas the 1920's, when I was a child in Talmud Torah (Hebrew School) in Brooklyn,mv teachers shuddered physically when they recounted incidents heard fromtheir grandfathers who had lived through that era. (L.M.)At a time when Russian and Ukrainian peasants used every shift to evade con-scription into the Tsarist army, which was regarded as lifelong deportation fromone's home, every Jewish community was made communally responsible to supplythe required number of recruits. With no official birth date registers, the require-ment that boys of twelve be supplied was met by seizing children as young as eight,torn from their mothers' arms, or kidnapped from the village streets.As a refinement, in 1850 Tsar Nicolai decreed that if any Jewish communityfailed to come up with the required number on time, three men aged twenty orover would be impressed into service, and one additional “recruit” for every 2,000rubles of taxes which might be considered in arrears. A year later it was orderedthat for any recruit who failed to appear, a relative would be seized in his place,even though head of a family. The fugitive, if apprehended, would be drafted ontop of the required quota. The official representatives of the community weresubject to be taken themselves if they failed to carry out the conscription: to beeither murderers themselves, or to be martyrs drafted as penal recruits — ofwhom there were many.In a country where they were given no human rights at all, were treated asoutcasts, untold thousands of Jewish youth filled the mass graves of Tsars’ inter-ventions in Central Europe and the Crimean War.Alexander Herzen, the Russian writer, left this eyewitness account from 1835,his questions to a Tsarist army officer and the answers:‘"Whom are \ou taking, and where?”“Oh, don’t ask, for it is heart-rending. Well, I suppose my superiors know allabout it; it is our duty to carry out orders and we are not responsible, but looking atit as a man, it is an uglv business.”“Why, what is it?”“You see, they have collected a crowd of cursed little Jew boys of eight or nineyears old. Whether they are taking them for the navy or what, I can’t say. At firstSokolievka IJustmgrad75expressions (adapted to Yiddish pronunciations), and a few Americanisms.

Also, conversion from theHebrew (lunar) year, beginning in September or October of the civil year, pres-ents a problem when the month is not known; so the equivalent civil year givenhere could be off by a year. From its foundation till after 1919, Sokolievka wasunder the Julian calendar, and thirteen days behind the Gregorian.We have translated the text very literally, omitting a few repetitions, and in a fewinstances correcting the sequence of sentences according to the sense.

The ‘chazzan’ Tzalel was also known as Rav Bezalel Odesser, mentioned bySholem Aleichem in his story Arba Kosos, 1900. His portrait is reproduced inAaron Rosen, The History of Hazzanuth (Yiddish and English), published by theJewish Ministers Cantors Association of America, 1924, p. 47, 55, with an anec-dote, page 71.3.

The occa-sion makes the story all the more poignant.‘Yeeden’ (literally, “Jews”) in direct address in Yiddish means simply “Gentle-men.” It often means simply “men,” with overtones supplied by the context.Some fine distinctions: ‘Rav’ is a title used before the name of an ordained rabbi.The ‘Rov’ means “the rabbi whose name is understood in the context.” A ‘rebbe’ isa teacher, not necessarily a rabbi, but when ‘Rebbe’ follow s the name of a town itusually designates a rabbi of a particular tradition, e.g. ‘the Tolner Rebbe’; thefirst e pronounced as in 7?iet, the second e as in mother. Any righteous man is a‘Tzaddik’ but customarily it refers to a rabbi of charismatic personality, not men-tioned by name, but designated by the town where his sect began, or where hehimself became noted. ‘Reb’ is a courtesy title applied to any man, like “Mr.”‘Rebbitzin’ is a wife to a Rabbi or to a ‘Rebbe.’4. ‘Cheder’ in the shtetl was the (religious) school, wTere hoys were taught, ortutored by a ‘melamed,’ (plural, ‘melamdim’), commonly in the ‘melamed’s’ home,concentrating on elementary Hebrew, on the prayer book (‘siddur’) and the72Sokolievka!J ustingradDiana and Leo Miller (1967)Explanatory NotesPronunciationIn Yiddish and Hebrew words herein, ch always represents the gutturalsound of clearing the throat, as in “cheder,” “Chanukah,” and in propernames, “Chayyim” and “Chayye” (both in two syllables). The sound of tsh(the combination of the letters tess-shin) is always so spelled here, as in“tsholent.” The last letter of the Hebrew/Yiddish alphabet is here translit-erated as 5, whenever it was so pronounced in Sokolievka: so v in “BessMedrash,” (the colloquial pronunciation of “Beis Midrash,”) not as th as inBeth, and not asf as in current Israeli usage. The letier tsade is transliteratedtz. Sokolievka is pronounced as if spelled “Sokoleefka,” accent on the “leef.”That is the Ukrainian form. The Russian form, sometimes seen, wasSokolovka. Justingrad: theJ pronounced like a Y, w, as inpull orfull, accenton the first syllable.Shtetlthis term refers to a specific type of settled Jewish community in an EastEuropean region, usually surrounded by a rural area and smaller villagespopulated by a majority of another nationality. During the period of thishistory, there were large urban Jewish communities in cities like Odessa,Warsaw, Vilna, Vienna, Berlin and elsewhere wTich w^ere quite cosmopoli-tan in culture; but somewhat as rural America long colored the civilizationof big-city industrial United States, so the shtetl dominated the image ofEast European Jewish life for centuries, until its annihilation in the Hitler-ian Holocaust 1933-1945. In Sokolievka the word was pronounced i/i/rn//,plural shtaytlach.1. The Wegodner Manuscript is in the possession of Dr. Morris Wagner,(grandson of Levi Wegodner), of South Bend, Indiana. Our photocopy was mostkindly sent us by a granddaughter, Chassia Lutsky (Mrs. Irving Lutsky) of Jeru-salem, after we learned of its existence from Mr. Harry Criden, of Kfar Blum,Israel. Levi Wegodner (pronounced Vigodner) was the winter’s name as he camefrom Sokolievka; but in Buffalo it w'as Americanized into Louis Wagner, asappears on his tombstone in Cheektowaga, with dates 1863-1936, w here his wife’sname is given as Hudel, 1863-1936.Except for the first sentence, which is in literary Hebrew % the text is in colloquialYiddish, with a sprinkling of Russian words for government titles and proverbial7170SokolievkaljustingradJewish pogroms to deflect peasant unrest, and so did the armiesseeking to restore the Tsars. For anti-Russian Ukrainian national-ists of all shades (with some very rare exceptions), pogroms wereofficial policy. And “liberators” opposed to the Soviet regime,such as the so-called “Left Social-Revolutionaries,” were no dif-ferent. So, after other episodes of atrocity, Uman was accorded itsspecial pogrom by the Left S-R forces of Klimenko, whose subal-tern Shtogrin explained “that it was true that he was urging thepeasants to a pogrom,for, said he, it was impossible to rouse the peas-ants in any other way."This Uman pogrom of May 12-14, 1919, with over three hun-dred dead, had its own cycle of horrors, where Jewish familieswere slaughtered in one half of apartment houses while in theother half their neighbors remained undisturbed behind the cru-cifixes on their doors.(There were some few instances which were different. In 1920,the Uman Council for Public Peace, mainly Christian but with aJewish minority, did stop a pogrom begun by Denikin’s Tsaristtroops. In 1919-1920, some of the Sokolievka refugees foundtemporary safety in Konela, where, for a time the Gentile popula-tion abstained from the pogroms.)The Nazis, in World War II, equalled all their predecessors inviciousness, but surpassed them in efficiency. There is said to be amonument in Uman, inscribed in Yiddish, to its 17,000 martyrswho perished in the Nazi Holocaust.What may be there now is uncertain. When we applied for per-mission to visit as tourists, some years ago, access and transit wereboth denied.Sokolievka / f ustingrad69because oppressors and oppressed there always were; and invari-ably the hapless Jews were trapped between the fires.Russians and Ukrainians argue pro and con about the fightingin the time of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 1648-1658, but it was a timewhen 100,000 Jews in Poland and the Ukraine sufferedmartyrdom for other people’s sins. The pogrom principle onceestablished, it was continued and repeated through the eight-eenth century by the heartless Haidamacks, perpetratingatrocities many times at many places. In 1749 they burned part ofUman and killed many Jews there. Still the town recovered andwas increased by refugees from other regions. In 1768 it was gar-risoned by Cossacks, under Ivan Gonta, who promised security toits Jewish community, and then treacherously betrayed the city tothe Haidamacks of Maxim Zhelesnyak, taking charge of theslaughter himself. The Jews gathered in their synagogues, led byLeib Shargorodski and Moses Menaker, where they were crushedby cannon fire, the fifth day of Tammuz. A three day massacrefollowed, in which none were spared, children, women, the aged.The dead numbered in many thousands, there and in othertowns, in June, 1768.^'’Still Uman came to life again. This time its revival was to a con-siderable degree linked with the name of Rabbi Nachman ofBratslav (1770-1811), who settled there in 1810. The role ofRabbi Nachman Ben Simchah, like the careers of ail founders ofChassidic sects, is very complex. His literary works, his doctrinaltenets, his factional conflicts and rabbinical rivalries are all opento diverse interpretation, but not the clear message he brought toUman: “You must not despair.”So, during the nineteenth century, Uman became a city knownfor its popular musicians, its ‘klezmer,’ as a center of ‘Haskalah,’the new enlightenment, and by 1910 had over 28,000 residents,more than half of them Jewish.All through these years, pogroms were endemic in Russia.Some, like Kishinev in 1903, attracted more attention than most.The pogroms of August 6 and November 3, 1905, in Uman, inwhich 14 were killed and ten times that number wounded, werejust two incidents among many.The next major wave of mass murder began in November1917. The Tsarist despotism had notoriously relied on anti-Appendix: UmanThe good people of Justingrad/Sokolievka knew of one “bigcity,” Uman. Kiev and Odessa were mere names, distant placesthrough which kinfolk passed on the way to emigrate abroad.Uman might have barely twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants,but to them it was their metropolis. To Sokolievka folk Uman wasthe city of the incredibly beautiful Sofievka Park, the eighth won-der of the world. And at the painful end, Uman was thetemporary, and totally insecure, refuge for many as they fledfrom their burning villages, towards Romania, towards America,towards Israel.From about 1800 on, Uman was also the center of theBratslaver Chassidim, but of this sect there were very few inSokolievka; so few, that Bratslaver traditions are unknown in theSokolievker diaspora. Neither, for whatever reasons, has therebeen transmitted the terrible tragical history of Uman itself.When, years ago, we, the editors of this volume, came across apassing mention of the sufferings of Uman in a story by SholemAleichem (“Greens for Shevuos”), we were startled. Something,we knew not what, had happened. Our surviving Sokolievker kincould not say why this history had not been recounted amongthem. So we looked into it, and resolved that it must be recalled tomemory, even if, at the moment, only briefly.After the expulsion from Spain, 1492, the largest area of Jew-ish settlement was in the East European belt Lithuania-Poland-Byelorussia-Ukraine-Bessarabia. Numerous as they were, insome towns the majority, the Jews lived in the cracks of “official”society. Official society might be Ottoman, or Polish, or Russian,or Ukrainian, or Cossack, or Ruthenian. It might be EasternOrthodox Christian or Roman Catholic Christian or miscellane-ous Moslem. Everywhere it was permeated by national hostilitiesand religious bigotries. Time and again open war raged amongthem, sometimes under banners of freedom and independence,68Sokolievkaljustingrad 67and Lucy (1923-1975) received the university schooling whichthey themselves had been denied; and proudly they displayed theblue stars for their two sons-in-law fighting for the four freedomsunder the American flag in World War II, Leo Miller in front lineinfantry and John Zimmerman on a navy destroyer.From David and Adella we first heard the story that began withJustina and ended in the ashes of Justingrad. There, by the oldriverside, stands no monument; but while books can be printedand children’s children can read, let the memory live.66Sokolievka IJustingradforming the Huleh swamp into a jewel of the Upper Galilee.

Gillman (1888-1968) and Etta C. Gillman, publishedby Dorrance Sc Co., 1969. This is a statistical and sociological anal-ysis of changing mores among the American descendants ofKhaim Kaprov, who is the same person as Chayyim Lichtzieher inWegodner’s narrative. The Gillman book includes two chaptersportraying life in Sokolievka, with several photographs.Immigrants arriving at different periods in the New York Cityarea created two landsmannschaften, theJustingrader society beforeWorld War I and the Sokolifker-Kenaler Fraternal Association in1923, maintaining friendly but independent relations. TheJustingrader society, in its flourishing days, was of cosmopolitanoutlook and often took constructive stands on broad national andinternational issues. Both societies still exist, with a handful ofmembers. (Typically, the American-born children of such immi-grants do not continue the mutual aid societies set up by their par-ents.) The Justingrader maintain burial grounds in the OldMontefiore Cemetery, Springfield Gardens, and in the NewMontefiore, Pinelawn. The Sokolifker-Kenaler plot is also onLong Island, in Beth David Cemetery, Elmont; on the pillars of itsgate are the bronze memorial tablets described elsewhere herein.Under the leadership of Samuel Kaprov (Samuel Kaplan) anorganized group of Sokolievker in Philadelphia have also contrib-uted to the memorials at Mashabei Sadeh.This present volume is also our personal tribute to the memoryof David and Adella (Logvin) Feldstein, and to the freedom-loving traditions which they cherished. Coming to America fromJustingrad in 1912, they settled in Brooklyn, New York. Theywere both lifelong garment workers, active members of Local 22,International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union. Becoming Amer-ican citizens, they were unfailing in civic consciousness, neveromitting to vote, and demonstrating intelligent interest in all mat-ters of public concern. They saw to it that their daughters, DianaSokolievka!Justin grad65“Then pogroms of the Russian-Japanese War period sent asmany as 200 families to Buffalo from this place. After onemassacre, Samuel Abba Cohen helped many to come to Buffalo,and at one time the Sokolievka group collected money to sendLeo Lieberman over there to help a hundred families to emigrate.Many prominent Buffalo families stemmed from this small town:they include those of Victor Wagner, past president of the UnitedJewish Federation of Buffalo, Hyman Kahn, the Abloves, theDozoretzes, the Carrels, the Chernoffs, the Rovners, the Rekoonsand many others.“About \9\Q, Hazzan Elia Berkun (1870-1943), a picturesque,bearded functionary, arrived to serve the congregation [of AnsheSokolovka, ''People of Sokolovka'^. When the synagogue was incor-porated in 1915, Joseph Berleant was president, and NathanGelman, a well known real estate broker, also played an impor-tant part in the early history of the group.“Anshe Sokolovka purchased some land and a house on SpringStreet south of Broadway. In 1917, the building was remodeledand the congregation worshipped at this spot until 1945, whenthe property was sold. Sam Dozoretz (b. 1884) seems to have beenthe person chiefly responsible for establishing this synagogue.Born in Sokolovka, Dozoretz came to Buffalo in 1908 and wasinterested both in synagogue matters and in the Farband, a LaborZionist group. When the synagogue was sold after many years ofuse, the money was kept for a while intact, but was later increasedto $4,000 and, on Dozoretz’s insistence, was sent to Israel forsome worthy purpose.” (page 198).The Buffalo community still maintains a common burialground, under the corporate name of The Holy Order of Living,at Pine Ridge Road and Delavan Avenue, north of GeneseeStreet, in Cheektowaga, a suburb of Buffalo. On its tombstonesare recorded many life stories; among these, Levi Wegodner,under his Americanized name of Loviis Wagner. At the entrancegate stands the stele commemorating the martyrs of the 1919pogroms.Many families of that settlement still reside in the vicinity; somehave “retired” to Florida, and others have dispersed across thecontinent.

Others came later.Thanks to the devotion and untiring efforts of this magnificentoctogenarian scholar and teacher, Baruch Bernstein (with finan-cial help from the American societies) there have been erectedcontinuing memorials to Sokolievka/Justingrad at KibbutzMashabei Sadeh, in the Negev thirty miles south from Beersheba.Here now stands a commemorative grove of pine trees; aninfirmary, for patients in need of hospital bed care, also availablefor other purposes; a clinic, equipped for out-patient care by phy-sicians; and a growing research and reference library. BaruchBernstein was also the guiding spirit of the Mashabei Sadeh book-let reproduced and translated here.The largest number of emigrants found their way to the UnitedStates of America, a few in the Boston area, some to Cleveland,but most settling in Buffalo, and in New York City and nearbyNewark.Of the Buffalo settlement one may read in Dr. Selig Adler’sFrom Ararat to Suburbia, History of the Jewish Community of Buffalo(Jewish Publication Society, 1961) that one of the pioneers wasAbraham Criden, about 1903, and:6362Sokolievka /J ustingradFrom those who trample in blood, thy forgiveness withhold; totheir offerings pay no heed, thou who dwellest on high, letretribution be turned back on these torturing barbarians, letthese accursed criminals be repaid in kind.For the crowning diadem of his fathers, the joy of Jeshurun, aprince among men, the holy Rabbi Gedalyahu Aharonuntimely plucked on the third day of the fifth month, hislife’s blood spurting on the soil when they ripped open hisbody.For the Pride of his flock, the Crown of his congregation, the Sageamong the Prodigies, the Symbol of Reverence, the holyGa’on Rabbi Pinchas murdered in his old age on the seventhof the fifth month, his life hewn down to the ground.Righteousness is thine, humiliation is ours, we have offended, wehave sinned, and twice as much have we been punished; wehave lost those who were our shields, those who held ourheads up high, in the balance their dying is equal to theburning of our Temple, our Beis HaMikdash.In darkness, in mourning we walk; from the enemy who crushesus, save our souls; from those who persecute us for noreason, hasten our deliverance to good, save us, in yourmercy, soon.Many there say ‘let us wipe them out as a people, yea, annihilatethem.’ Annul their courses, nullify their thoughts, let thembe a symbol of shame and derision among the nations.Guard us, remember us the sheep of thy flock, duly requite thetormentors of thy children, proclaim freedom to thy people,look upon them, for they are thy people and thy portion.Restore the honor of thy Torah, for they have compelled thosewho study thy Torah to drink wormwood and poison; leadthy innocents to eternal life, and the cursed criminals toshame and eternal disgrace.For those who yielded up their lives sanctifying His name,Lord of mercy, may they be sheltered within the shelter ofHis wings for eternity and may their souls be bound up in thebond of eternal life, G-d being their portion, and may theyrest in peace where they lie, and let us say.

Two of these are on the pogroms of Uman andSokolievka, one of twelve quatrains, one of twenty quatrains,rhymed lyric dirges, whose painful beauty is beyond translation.These were preceded by 3.Hazkarah, an/n Memoriam: we shall tryto convey some of its feeling in an English paraphrase. Thepoems and the Hazkarah are reproduced on pages 99 to 95.In the original Hebrew, this/n Memoriam is a work of rare art-istry. This art can be somewhat described, but cannot be repro-duced in the translation.The indented opening and closing passages are adaptationsfrom the El Male Rachamim prayer in the Jewish burial service.Framed between these two passages are twenty-two long lines,one for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in acrostic form,which is the format of the Hebrew text of the first four chapters ofthe Bible book of Lamentations.

Not a trace of the old town remained.Here Ends the Mashabei Sadeh DocumentS okolicvka IJustingrad ^ 7Denikin (Tsarist) passed through the shtetl on their way to fightagainst the Bolsheviks. Three Jews whom they chanced upon onthe way they killed. Again there was robbing, looting, settinghomes afire.In Denikin’s days, there was total anarchy. From the old townof Sokolievka, hoodlum ruffians came night after night, rioted,attacked Jews, burned houses, to force the Jews to leave. Manyfamilies did flee at that time. This went on about three months.The Denikin forces were defeated. On their retreat fromByelo-Tserkov they again passed through Justingrad. Again theybegan with burning homes, and this time they ended killing sometwo hundred. In the severe frost, the Denikin forces seized Jews,dragged them to the ice of the frozen river, stripped them nakedwhere they froze to death.The shtetl was in ruins. The community of stunned mourners,crushed by these disasters, wandered around in a delirium ofdespair. The ground burned under their feet. They fled, some tonearby Uman, others to Odessa, crowding miserably into emer-gency shelter in the synagogues. Many decided to leave thecountry, making their way on foot overland to the River Dniester,the Romanian border. Risking their lives in the river crossing,they filtered stealthily across the frontier, and reached Romania,penniless and starving.Families broke up. Some, who had relatives in America, wereable with their help to cross the ocean to the United States. A fewfamilies after great hardships managed to reach the land of Israeland settle there.The End of the ShtetlThere is no way now of getting any details about how manyfamilies or people remained after the mass exodus, and how theylived from 1920 to 1941.

Alas, on the captives ofJustingrad, the wrath of the Lord descended.When the captives were led out on to the “Bridge,” some par-ents overtook them, and pleaded for their children, offering stillmore money. They were shot down and thrown into the river:among these parents were Menachem Tchernus and YitzchakSnitzer.Some of the young men, seeing what was up, pleaded withZeliony to take them as recruits to his band. The murderermocked their words and ordered them to be mowed down. Awithering fire was opened on them from a hidden ambush, froma machine gun concealed by bushes.

He died two months later in thehospital at Uman, but from him were learned the details of whathad happened. The bodies were first found in a ravine byGentiles, who notified the town.Chayye Shuman, four of whose brothers were among thosekilled, recalls: “The Gentiles refused to bring the bodies to theshtetl. The Jewish population rented horses and wagons fromthem, and themselves brought back the dead. My father wasamong those digging graves for my brothers. Nachum the apoth-ecary tried to help him digging. My father said to him, ‘Take iteasy, Nachum, let me take care of my children.’ My brother Bar-uch who was killed was married and father of a little boy.”The Denikin AtrocitiesAfter Zeliony’s massacre, the shtetl was raided often by localgangs from nearby villages. No day passed without some tragicevent. So the year 5679 came to an end (September, 1919).On Rosh HaShanah 5680 (September 25, 1919) the army ofSokolievka / / ustingrad55dusk the murderer came to where the Rabbi was sitting and shothim dead.The intruders saw him fall, and they left without further vio-lence or looting. It is surmised that the bandit leader had beentold by the goyim of the vicinity that the town was under the pro-tection of the Tzaddik who dwelled there. This murderer wassent to “remove” the Rabbi before they attacked the town.The MassacreDuring the night looting and vandalism began. Sunday morn-ing saw streets deserted, some houses already devastated. At day-light a hunt and round-up began, the bandits seizing all youngmen, especially any from eighteen to thirty. They were draggedto the synagogue of the Tolner Chassidim and locked up there.The bandit chief announced that a “war tax” was imposed ofnot less than a million rubles, to be collected and turned over intwo hours. A communal worker, surrounded by armed bandits,went from home to home to collect the money. Meanwhile thehostages in the synagogue were being beaten down with theprayer stands by the armed bandits who then stomped on theirheads.Two hours passed, and the sum demanded had not beenreached. Ten men were taken out and killed. Another hourpassed, and another ten were killed. At noon the collectorsreturned to the synagogue, having amassed only about half theamount demanded. The bandit officer took the money, refusedto release the prisoners and gave the word to start plundering thehouses.The bandits spread out through the shtetl, broke into stores,looted the merchandise, beating people with their whips. Therewas shooting of men, and raping of women. They spoke of killingall the men in the synagogue.About five o’clock the bandit horde began to move out of thetown. They separated out about a hundred and fifty young menfrom the rest in the synagogue and took them along as captives.At first some thought that nothing very serious would happen tothem, because in another town Zeliony had also seized a largenumber of young men, but only warned them not to help the Bol-54SokolievkalJustin gradWhen the goyim of nearby villages came to seize their arms, theyresisted. These goyim then seized a number of Jews, draggedthem to the “Bridge,” to throw them into the river. Fortunatelysome goyim from Sokolievka proper at the other end of the“Bridge” intervened to protect their neighbors, and the othergoyim left.On another occasion a bandit troop of 150 invaded the shtetl,demanded the people give up their clothing and boots to the ban-dits and pay a ransom of half a million rubles. This time the shtetlwas saved by the courage of two men who slipped away and rodeto Monastrishtsh where they made contact with the governmentforces (Bolshevik) camped there. When the bandits were makingready to let loose their terror of the shtetl they were surprised bythe arrival of a force of regular soldiers headed by a Jewish com-mander.The people of the shtetl saw these deliverances as miracles.From mouth to ear the word was passed that Reb Pinchas’l theRabbi had said: “As long as I live, no blood will be shed in mytown.”’’^The Murder of Reb Pinchas’l the RabbiIt was ‘Shabbos Chazon,’ the Sabbath before Tisha B’Av,5679.^^ It was a pleasant summer day. People were relaxing aftera week of fear and anxiety, walking in the streets, talking aboutthe latest news. Suddenly about five o’clock firing of guns washeard at the western approach to the shtetl. A horde of the rebelbandit Zeliony numbering in the thousands “announced” itsentrance. At once there was panic in the streets. People ran homein utter confusion, parents hunting for their children, childrenfor their parents. Screams of fright rose everywhere. Peoplelocked themselves in their houses, women and children hid them-selves in the cellars.Towards evening residents on the Rabbi’s street heard thesound of horses’ hoofs, and saw several mounted horsemenapproaching the Rabbi’s house. One of them went into thecourtyard, up the steps and opened the door. The Rabbi had justfinished the ‘Se’uda shlishit,’ the third meal of the Sabbath, andwas about to begin the Ma’ariv evening prayers.

My brother Shimon [Shimon Geisinsky, son ofYitzchak Yoel the 'Shochef^ sought out the plays, casted the players,prepared scenery decorations and directed the staging. Amongthe actors were Shulki Menachem’s, Berel Herzl Peretz’s (a finelad, played very well), Mani Dubobis (she was outstanding inMirele Efros, a classic drama by Jacob Gordin); also Perel Dratsh,and Yocheved Nachum-Elye’s. Alick Kuzminsky played the roleof a child beautifully. Traina, his sister, also was a good actress,and my sister Feige did not do so badly either. Shimon startedwith the plays of Abraham Goldfaden and Jacob Gordin, andwent on to those of Peretz Hirschbein. The shtetl ofMonastrishtsh invited Shimon and his troupe to come and playfor them. To our sorrow the pogroms then began and a tragic endcame to the dramas of Sokolievka.”The Annihilation of Sokolievka\World War I ravaged Russia from 1914 to 1917, and Jews served inthe Tsarist army (David Feldstein served in the peace time army before hecame to America). Yet this memoir makes no mention of that war. The Rus-sian Revolution and the ensuing 'civiV war thoroughly disrupted all dailylife, yet this memoir, and the letters received from survivors which formedits basis, make no mention of the events of 1917-1918. So frightful werethe events of the 1919 pogroms that those earlier cataclysms were blurredout of the minds and memories of the survivors.]The years 1919-1920 were years of agony to the Jews of theUkraine. Various armed factions made war against the centralMoscow government and against each other for control of theregion.

In between their battles amongeach other, these various bands broke into quiet towns andwreaked atrocities upon the Jews.At first the Justingrad community kept its spirit up. ChayyimGreenspan, who later settled in Buffalo, recalls: With twelverifles, they set up a night watch, and stopped night robberies.52 5 okolievka /] ustin grading the university entrance examinations given in the nearby cityof Uman.Teachers of Russian began to appear in the shtetl. Theyoffered private lessons. At first they had girl pupils, who in effectwere excluded from studying Torah in ‘cheder’.^^ Soon they werejoined by boys who had finished ‘cheder’ and saw little value inBess Medrash studies. The whole household would be studying.Each one sat in his own corner and memorized verses of Russianpoets, the rules of grammar or the rules of arithmetic. In thosedays they did a great deal of memorizing.Boys and girls saved pennies from market day earnings to payteachers’ tuition fees. At night they sat and studied with diligenceand devotion. It was a great ‘mitzvah’ to help the children of thepoor, and those who were more advanced in their studies wouldgive them free lessons.With the acquisition of the Russian language, speaking Russianand reading of Russian books spread among the youth. In thosedays there began to come into the shtetl youths without names,“comrades.” They would call the youth to secret meetings outsidethe town, and tell them about the great revolution coming soon inRussia, and the necessity, in the coming time, of organizingstrikes and protest demonstrations. At these meetings there weredistributed leaflets and propaganda pamphlets to read andspread. Sokolievka had no industrial factories and workers, sothere were no strikes. The youth came to hear what the speakerswould say and to learn what was in the pamphlets. The youthsought knowledge.[A letter from Bennie Berkun touches on another development.] “Youask about Zionists in Sokolievka. In 1911, when I was fourteen, Ialready considered myself a member of the ‘Tz’irei Tzion’(“Youth for Zion”). Gedalyahu Mendl, grandson of the Rabbi,Samuel Kaprov, and Konstantinovsky conducted Zionist activity.We had a club and public meetings. A man named Moshe used tocome to us from Zashkov to lecture on the Zionist movement(probably Moshe Skriton, who was related to the Dayan family).We organized a club in the village of Voronoye. Older folk wereGeneral Zionists, sons of the ‘Baalebatim’ were ‘Tz’irei Tzion,’sons of working craftsmen were Seimovtzim. We used to argue inthe streets of the town, especially after the Revolution, beforeSokolievkalJustingrad51secular culture (‘Haskalah’) and so find favor in the eyes of Godand man.The Modernized ChederYitzchak Yoel Kuzminsky was also the initiator of the modern-ized ‘Cheder’ in Sokolievka. Thanks to his connections with theenlightened ‘maskilim’ of the shtetl, some fifteen pupils, childrenof “cheder” age, were assembled and entrusted to BaruchBernstein as their teacher (‘moreh’). He spoke Hebrew [as a livinglanguage] and had teaching experience. He was acquainted withthe new method of teaching reading of that day, called the oralmethod and xh^IvritB'Ivrit method of teaching “the Hebrew lan-guage in Hebrew,” without translation into Yiddish.^®This modern ‘Cheder’ was held in a small room in the home ofYitzchak Yoel’s parents. One of the pupils was his youngerbrother Alick.The rapid progress of the children in reading and in speakingHebrew on the shtetl streets made a strong impression, and thissmall modernized cheder exercised great influence on Hebreweducation in the shtetl. Teachers who were, so to speak,“progressive”, discarded texts that used Yiddish translations andadopted HaDibur Halvri (“The Hebrew Word”) of M. Krinsky,with its many easy conversations and illustrations for discussion,from which the children by themselves learned the Hebrew lan-guage and to speak Hebrew.The modernized ‘cheder’ used as atext the P’rakim Rishonim (“First Chapters”) of Jacob Fichman,whose poetic spirit was much loved by the children. The modern-ized ‘cheder’ was set up in 1912, and soon afterward a modernHebrew School was opened in the town.The Youth of Sokolievka Acquires ‘Haskalah’Years after years the youth had been content with what theyhad learned from the local instructors: to write a letter in Yiddishand address the envelope in Russian. But all things change andadvance with time. Little by little the longing awakened in theyouth to know more than this, to learn Russian in a systematicway, to acquire a general education. Some even dreamed of tak-50Sokolievka / Justin gradenlightened person, to whom a post office was a necessity, nowmore readily settled in the town. The post office was both an eco-nomic and a cultural stimulant to the shtetl. Through the postoffice not only letters and packages, but many periodicals andbooks came, in Hebrew, in Yiddish and even in Russian.The Old ‘Cheder’ and Its DefectsThe ‘cheder’ was an antiquated kind of school, and its methodswere old and obsolete. The ‘melamed’ was not a professional. Anyman who failed to find himself whatever source of ‘parnossa’would open a ‘cheder’ and persuade parents to send their chil-dren to him. Arithmetic and writing were not taught in the‘Cheder’, and so many of the children went in the afternoon to ateacher (‘moreh’) who taught the four operations of reckoning,and writing in Hebrew and Yiddish. They made a particularpoint of beautiful script: how to begin writing the letter, when topress down on the pen point, when to release it, all according toprescribed rules. Usually the teacher wrote on the top line of thenotebook page some proverb or verse, and the pupil undertookto copy it, trying to imitate the teacher’s beautiful handwriting,repeating it to the end of the page. In a higher grade, they copiedletters from a book of sample correspondence composed in flow-ery style.Generally boys studied in ‘cheder’ until their Bar-Mitzvah.Poor children stopped by age ten or eleven, and went out to helptheir parents to support the family, to wait on customers in astore, or to sell matches, kerosene and the like at a stand on mar-ket day. Some were apprenticed to learn a trade.Some talented boys and children of the well-to-do continuedtheir studies even after age thirteen. Their parents would hire a‘melamed’ deep versed in Torah, who tutored them in his houseor in the synagogue. These arrangements did not always work outwell. Parents complained that there no longer were good‘melamdim’ in the shtetl. In 1903 two young boys were sent to thePerlmutter Yeshiva in Kishinev, where in addition to their reli-gious studies there were also taught secular subjects. New windswere blowing in the shtetl, the arrival of the era of‘Haskalah’, anddevout parents wanted their sons to learn Torah and also acquire5 okolievka /] us tin grad49According to Mr. Baruch Bernstein, who was one of thisassociation, the effective role in this movement was taken by theyoung ‘Maskir Yitzchak Yoel Kuzminsky. He was son of the‘Shochet’, and in line to inherit that post from his aged father,becoming ‘Shochet’ in his place [a position requiring unquestionedorthodoxy in the public eye].^'^ Therefore Yitzchak Yoel could notopenly participate in this activity and so he worked behind thescenes. He would invite the youth, the older boys and girls, to hishome, guide them with his counsel, encourage them to take partin the cultural field. He arranged the lectures by visiting writers,evenings for readings and for plays. Thanks to his expertise inHebrew and Yiddish literature, with the funds collected, thelibrary was opened with a selection from the best in both lan-guages. In a short time a large number of readers subscribed.The library began with one shelf, but as readership increasedso did income, and with that, the number of books. Russian bookswere also added, and pamphlets dealing with current questions,the Russian revolution [of 1905] and the socialist movement,reading matter taboo in the eyes of the regime. The library waskept in rented space in private homes, and for fear of betrayal ofits secret to the local authorities, it frequently had to be movedfrom one place to another. But the activists involved never weak-ened. Teenage youths brought wooden egg crates from the eggdealers and built cases for the books. The library grew, andbecame an important factor in the education of the youth and themasses of the people in the shtetl.The Post OfficeThe shtetl suffered through many years for lack of properpostal communications. Letters, packages and money were sentfrom Sokolievka by wagoners, and special messengers. Mail sentto Sokolievka from other places arrived after much delay throughthe nearby village of Popivka. From there it was brought by an oldJewish man, Chayyim Yehoshua’s, who distributed it to homesand was paid for his trouble. All the mail, few letters and fewerperiodicals, were tied up in his kerchief — a small one. With theopening of a post office in the shtetl, a sense of extension came tothe settlement. The shtetl ceased to be isolated. A doctor, or any48Sokolievka I Justin gradNo one taught them, no one trained them for all they did andtried to do. They arose from themselves and came forward to theservice of the people, because the hour had come, their servicewas acceptable and was a blessing to the whole town.These last twenty years of Justingrad-Sokolievka might havebeen a turning point in its history. There was a kind of changingof the guard between the generations, that brought tidings of anew era, but all that was nipped in the bud by the annihilation ofthe town.The ^^Bank”Previously someone who was in need of a loan had to turn to ausurious money lender or to the charitable Free Loan Society(‘Chevra Gmilas-Chassadim’). In either choice the application fora loan involved unpleasantness. A borrower had to accepthumiliation, and bring personal belongings as security collateral:a valuable garment, a pillow, a silver vessel or jewelry. Whoeverborrowed from a money lender had to pay very high interest,usury.And hereupon arose a cooperative among the merchants of theyounger generation, led by Joseph (Yossel) Chertov, an intelli-gent and understanding man, who succeeded, after manyapproaches to the authorities, in receiving permission to establisha “Savings and Loan Fund.” This depository, for short called “theBank” was a very useful institution, and helped advance industryand commerce. To get a loan from the Bank was not a matter ofpleading and a pledge. The borrower simply filled in an applica-tion. The management validated the application, and the bor-rower and two co-signers as guarantors signed a note promisingto repay on time. The money could be repaid in monthlyinstallments, and with normal legal interest.The LibraryThe need for access to books was great. But in Russia, authori-zation from the regime was in those days required for opening alibrary, and all representations to the officials to this end were invain. A grouping of local young people determined to set up an“illegal” library, without authorization.5 okolievka /] ustingrad d 7Changes and InnovationsDuring the last twenty years of Sokolievka, from the beginningof the century to its annihilation, there were great changes. Newinstitutions were founded, new developments in the field of theeconomy and of culture, and these were mainly the fruit of theinitiatives and the efforts of the new generation.The members of the old generation were not adaptable tonovelties, and to any activity which deviated from the bounds oftradition and custom.When an economic crisis struck the town in the first decade, inlarge measure due to the weakened status of Russian Jewry ofthat day, conscientious members of the community who weredeeply rooted in its life were affected by despair and depression,and left their families to seek their fortune in America.It was the young merchants who were stimulated to seekimprovement in the town. They obtained permission to open afinancial institution which helped craftsmen and storekeeperswith loans for constructive purposes. These merchants alsoimportuned the authorities to hasten the opening of a post officein the town. These young men founded the “modernized cheder”and the young married men sent their children to it. These youthorganized a public library, initiated literary evenings and othercultural activities, drawing on local talent and on forces fromnearby towns. If a writer chanced to come to town, immediately acommittee of the youth appeared to invite him to lecture, and atroop of enthusiastic youth spread through the town to selltickets.This was one of the qualities of the town, voluntary contribu-tion of effort with spirit, the traditional joy of doing a ‘mitzvah’(good deed) with all your heart.In this awakening of Sokolievka to improvement andinnovation, an awakening that blended with the great yearning ofthe youth for education and the acquisition of knowledge, may beseen the peculiarity of the development in the shtetl. Under theexternal shell of the frozen absence of motion, there were bud-ding new and creative forces from whom emerged new buildersand renewers. Yossel Chertov the “apikoros,”®® Yitzchak YoelKuzminsky the “intellectual,” and Shimon Geisinsky, a modestand popular good fellow, these blossomed and grew on the quiet.46Sokolievka!Justin gradcertain widow’s turn had come to have matzos baked at thebaker’s, and she could not pay the wages of the men and womenworking at the bakery, neighbors gathered at once and went tothe bakery, women, boys and girls, and shared among themselvesthe work, the kneading, the rolling, the perforation. Since thebaker used to assign these widows’ turns to a late evening hour,when the regular men and women employees left the bakery, thedonated labor continued to a late hour of the night, but the volun-teers did not leave until they had completed the work, and tooktheir leave of the widow with hearty exchanges of blessings, afterhelping her carry the matzos to her house.Visiting the SickWhen a man fell ill, his neighbors and friends came to visit him.Women would bring preserves of their own making, especiallyraspberry preserves, good for sweating. It was a great ‘mitzvah’(good deed) to lend a thermometer to the sick, or a rubber bag toput ice on the head, and other utensils. If the sick person waspoor, neighbors and good-hearted people did not wait for the‘Bikur-Cholim Chevra’ but themselves called a “doctor,” broughtmedicines, and supplied the invalid with chicken soup to keep uphis strength. When an epidemic broke out, such as the cholera,there were people who volunteered to wage war against the dis-ease. Healthy and courageous men did not flinch from thedanger, as soon as the symptoms of the illness appeared, mas-saged the sick man with vinegar, and warmed his body in everyway. In that way they saved many from death. The company oflife savers was always ready for action. Even on ‘Shabbos’, if wordcame to the synagogue that someone had been stricken, thesemen would immediately take off their ‘talleisim’ and hurried tobring help, because the saving of life supersedes the Sabbath.It happened once that a poor woman was ill, and the doctorprescribed massage for the feet. The women of Sokolievka knewvarious methods of nursing the sick: to apply a mustard plaster,they knew ‘shtellen bankes’ (cupping) but massage was not intheir ken. But the younger generation was also alert to the fate ofa solitary invalid, and a group of teen age girls understood to mas-sage her feet, and also to take care of feeding her until her recov-ery.®^Sokolievka / justingrad45poor chose the Shabbos with the Torah portion ‘Mishpatim’,because it includes verse Exodus 22:24, “If you shall lend moneyto my people,” (it shall be without interest).Charity to the PoorBesides the charity ‘chevras’ there were also good heartedpeople, especially pious women, who busied themselves collectingdonations, for a poor bride, for a widow with many children, andthe like. There were women who on Fridays (Sabbath eves) wentfrom door to door and collected ‘chalehs’, fish, meat, and secretlybrought these to the homes of the needy. People were veryembarrassed of their poverty.There were also poor people who begged door to door, butthey came from other towns. The poor of Sokolievka wereashamed to put out their hands in their own town. They went toother places. There was a kind of exchange of poor between onesettlement and another.A poor man who came for alms might receive a penny or a pieceof bread, sometimes a glass of tea. People of means would invitethe poor in for a meal. For someone whose clothes were veryragged, they would find some used garment. So that no poor manshould leave any house empty-handed, there was instituted in thetown a custom of charity coupons, a kind of local currency. Onthese parchment coupons were inscribed in scribe’s lettering,Sokolievka Basket. The nominal value of the coupon was a halfpenny. A poor man could buy what he needed to eat with thesecoupons in any store in town. When leaving town, he couldexchange the coupons for real cash in any store or at the CharityGabai’s. On the eve of Shabbos and festival nights, worshippers inthe synagogue would invite such a poor man to their home, givehim food and lodging. The ‘Shammos’ of the synagogue was incharge of the assignment of these poor among those who invitedthem, and took care that no poor man remained without an invi-tation. Since there was no municipal lodging house for poor(transients), the ‘Shammos’ used to give permission to spend thenight in the synagogue near the winter stoves.A special intensification of help for the poor was felt beforefestivals, especially before Passover. When it became known that a44Sokolievka IJ ustingradhand.^^. During intermissions they slipped out into the yard noisywith little boys and girls brought by older sisters.Most of the synagogues had bookcases full of books, particu-larly volumes of the Talmud and of the Mishna. Worshipperswho were learned in Torah would continually study them.Youths who had finished ‘chedef also used to study here in thesebooks, by themselves, or under the supervision of a ‘melamed’ setup here by their parents. Children loved the synagogue, andwould come to play in the yard in hours when they were free fromthe ‘cheder.’The Synagogue and Communal NeedsThe town was a constituted municipality. The town head wasnominally chosen by the inhabitants, but he was subject to the(central) Tsarist regime. His functions were limited mainly to ful-filling the regime’s decrees, the issuance of passports (for internaltravel and identification) to inhabitants and those “registered” inthe town.^'^ There was no municipal education department orwelfare department. Communal needs were the concern of thecharity ‘gabaim,’ and various support ‘chevras’ (societies): the‘Bikur-cholim chevra’ to visit the sick, the ‘chevra’ of ‘Gmilas-Chassadim’ for making interest-free loans.In times of trouble and emergency, for instance and epidemicor a great fire, or when there was urgent need to help the poorand widows at the approach of a festival, this was proclaimed as a“public notice by the Rabbi and the Gabai” in the synagogue.They would delay the reading of the Torah (portion of the week)until people volunteered to give a hand to organize help. Some-times the worshippers would be asked to leave their ‘talleisim’ inthe synagogue after prayers, so that they would come to redeemthem after the ‘Shabbos’ (by making the needed financial contri-bution).Once a year each ‘chevra’ held a general meeting and banquetfor members. Each ‘chevra’ had its particular ‘Shabbos.’ The‘Chevra Bikur-Cholim’ chose the Sabbath of the blessing of themonth of lyar, because the Hebrew letters of lyar are the initialsof the words “I am the Lord your Healer.” The ‘Chevra Gmilas-Chassadim’ which loaned money (with no interest charge) to theSokolievka!J ustingrad43to house, and all these candles were lit in the synagogue in honorof the anniversary of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yocha’i.^^Three days before Shevuos, “the three boundary days,” duringwhich Moses set bounds around Mount Sinai beyond which thepeople might not ascend, children were free a half day from‘cheder.’^^ Nature was then in its fullest glory. The open spaces inthe town were green, and covered with wild flowers. Villagewomen brought fragrant greens to market for sale. On the holi-day eve, the children decorated the home with green plants, andthe synagogue was also decorated that way. In the Diaspora theholiday of Shevuos is celebrated for two days. On the secondnight candles, previously collected by the children, were lit in thesynagogue windows and on shelves in honor of King David, who,according to tradition passed away during Shevuos.The festivals were over. Then came the days of mourning, therestricted davs from the Seventeenth of Tammuz to the Ninth in/Av.^^ Children, however, did not forget their games even in thesedays of mourning. On Tisha B’Av eve [when the adults sat on thefloor in stocking feet to lament the destruction of the ancient Temple inJerusalem, and the exile dispersion of the people from their ancient home-land] children came to the synagogue with pockets full of‘berelach’ — cockleburrs, thistles, thorns. In the dim gloom of thesynagogue, during the chanting of the Book of Lamentations,they threw these burrs on the congregation, into their ‘payos’(sidecurls) and beards. This was accepted custom and no onewould scold the children for it.The Synagogues of SokolievkaMr. Peretz Shuman, a Sokolievker settled in Buffalo, in one ofhis letters, tallied all the synagogues in the town: the synagogue ofRabbi Pinchas’l; the synagogue of the Tolner Chassidim; the syn-agogue of the Kontakozov Chassidim; the “Big Bess Medrash”;the one called ‘Dos Shulech’l,’ “the little synagogue,” favored bythe craftsmen, and the second ‘Shulech’f established by a groupwhich withdrew from the first. All in all, six houses of prayer.On Sabbaths and festivals, most of the synagogues were full ofworshippers. Children stood with their parents, prayer book in42Sokolievka IJustingr adthe name of Haman during the reading of the ‘Megilla’ (Book ofEsther) in the synagogue. During the day children circulatedthrough the streets bringing ‘shalachmonnes’ [customary exchangesof cakes and other baked delicacies as holiday gifts] to relatives, neigh-bors and friends, and for their service received some of the good-ies as a reward. Poor boys and girls would receive money gifts.Towards evening the streets became empty, as everybody wenthome to the jolly Purim ‘se’udah’ (festive dinner).To the children by far the most beloved of all holidays wasPesach. There are thirty days from Purim to Pesach, but all ofthese became ‘the eve of Pesach,’ days filled with the many prepa-rations for the festival. Beets were pickled, chickens were bought,matzos were baked, and ‘chometz’ was cleared from the house.Every single thing was moved out of its place, whitewashed,scrubbed, aired out, till every nook and cranny was cleaned. Theybrought down the Passover dishes from the attic, and boughtwine for the “four cups.” Boys and girls shared in all these prepa-rations. On Passover eve they put on their holiday clothes, every-thing new, from shoes to hat, and awaited the ‘Seder.’In the Diaspora they conduct two ‘Seder’ evenings, on the firstand second days of the holiday. At each ‘Seder’ were asked the“Four Questions,” the ‘Haggadah’ (story of Passover) was read,the “Four Cups” of wine were drunk, the “Afikoman was stolen,”and the delicious Passover dishes were eaten. After four interme-diate ‘Choi Ha-Moed’ days, during which children were exemptfrom going to ‘cheder,’ playing their “nut” games and strollingabout at will, came the last two days, the seventh of Pesach, andthe final (eighth) which is observed only in the Diaspora. Pesach isalso the festival of spring; trees put forth leaves, birds chirp, andfields freed from their mass of snow begin to turn green anew.^®During the days of “Counting the Omer” between Pesach andShevuos, days of mourning in which they would not cut their hairor put on new clothes, there was only one day of rejoicing. LagB’Omer. Little children would get bows-and-arrows and go walk-ing with their Rebbe in the meadows to shoot the arrows. Olderboys fended for themselves, went looking and found hoops fromold barrels, perfect for making bows, sneaked up on horses topluck hairs from their tails for bowstrings. Mature and well-behaved children were sent to collect candles, going from houseSokolievka /J ustingrad41stuck into it. On Simchas Torah all the boys were called up to theTorah (in an ‘aliyah’), all crowded together under a big ‘tallis’spread over their heads while the first chapters of Genesis wereread. On this day they chorused together with the ‘Chazzan,’ andall the worshippers, and afterward were given cake and wine.^^All day they mingled with the merrymakers who danced and sangin the streets. The celebration peaked towards evening. RebAvraham, the ‘Chazzan,’ climbed up on the roof of thesynagogue, and there, next to the chimney, he chanted the‘Mincha’ service, he above, the entire congregation below,responding in a loud voice, dancing, and chanting “Holy, Holy.”They loved to rejoice in their festivals.Next day the children joined in dismantling the ‘Sukkah.’ Theywere a bit sad, and the season was also a bit sad. Autumnal windswere blowing, leaves beginning to fall. A little more and gray dayswill begin. Children start going to ‘cheder,’ some to their previousone, some to a new, dressing in warm winter clothing and wholeshoes, while the heart looks ahead to when a new holiday willarrive.It would take a very long time to tell all about these festivals andhow the children enjoyed them. The children always had morefun than the adults. At Chanukah, the grownups were satisfied tolight the candles, to sing ‘A1 HaNissim’ and ‘Ma’oz Tzur’, but forchildren Chanukah had every joy. They played ‘dreidef and“cards”; ran to all their relatives, grandfathers andgrandmothers, to every uncle and aunt, to collect ‘Chanukahgelt,’ to be treated with {potato] ‘latkes’ and [fat goose-skin] crac-klings. ‘Cheder’ studies were half a day only.^^The taste of these ‘latkes’ was still in our mouth, and already itwas Chamisho-Osor B’Shvat [the fifteenth day in the month Shvat,observed as the New Year of Trees, actually six weeks after Chanukah], Inthe Diaspora there was no planting of trees, but we marked theholiday by enjoying Chamisho-Osor B’Shvat fruits, at home andat the ‘cheder.’ The little children, innocents, were convinced thatall these fruits, the bukser (dried carob), figs, almonds and raisinsall came from the Land of Israel.In the Diaspora it was not customary to put on masquerade dis-guises on Purim, but, for many days before, children were busymaking all kinds of‘grager’ noisemakers and rattles to drown out40S okolievka /] ustingradChildren used to particularly look forward to the making of thewax candles for Yom Kippur [especially long, to burn more thantwenty-four hours]. This was Mama’s holy work. She twisted thewicks from flax thread, into lengths which she had measured onthe graves of kinfolk in the cemetery, and she made marks onthem, marks for the “soul candle,” to be brought to be lit in thesynagogue, and marks for the “life candle,” to be lit at home.When she stood making these candles, all the children gatheredaround her as if looking upon some great wonder.Which child does not remember trying to fast on Yom Kippur,and the final closing ‘Ne’ilah’ prayer, at the end of the day, whenall sins may become white as snow? When all the prayers weredone, everyone would return home, to have something to eat,and to rejoice, and the children would get the leftover honey toanoint the corners of the house, as a charm to ensure a good lifeand sweet.Next morning boards and planks were brought down from theattic, and used to set up the ‘sukkah’ for the Succos holiday. Chil-dren off from ‘cheder’ filled the streets or helped to erect the‘sukkah.’ The older ones handed the green boughs to cover the‘sukkah’ up to papa on the ladder, while the little innocent oneswould be sent to a neighbor to ask for the loan of a ‘Sukkah-shears.’^^How sublime it was to sit [mealthnes] in the ‘Sukkah’, how sub-lime all of Succos, with all its intermediate days. Children playedgames with nuts [like marbles], romped in the ‘sukkah,’ went to themarket to see the autumn fruits brought in to town by the gen-tiles. In the streets men passed by carrying ‘esrog’ and ‘lulav.’The day before Hoshanah Rabba (seventh day of Succos) theolder boys went to the river to pick willow twigs to make‘Hoshanos’ for sale. When the ‘Hoshanos’ were beaten (againstthe prayer stands) in the synagogue service, the children’s delightknew no bounds.They also got into their hands the ‘lulavim’and ‘esrogim’ discarded by the elders.Succos winding up, comes the festival of Simchas Torah. Thechildren run around to find sticks for Simchas Torah flags. TheRebbes’ assistants used to sell these sticks made from willowbranches. Then all that was needed was to insert the (paper) flagin a slit in the staff, and top it with a red apple with a wax candleSokolievka /J ustingrad39served as dates. After ‘Shabbos Korach’ [the Sabbath when the weeklyTorah portion was read about Korach, Numbers 76] or just beforethen, cherries start to ripen in the gardens. To the child the holi-day was linked to nature’s season.Children loved these festivals. All days of the year, exceptShabbos, the child walked the streets barefoot or in torn shoes,and wore old patched clothes. For the festival, however, newshoes were ordered and holiday clothes. In addition, for the childthere were prepared tasty holiday delicacies and sweets, and allkinds of enjoyments.At Passover, tradition gave the child a featured role, concernedwith what the child should be asking, and what relating. Wheretradition failed to provide such a role the child saw to it himself.'’^For example: at ‘Slichos’ time [the month before Rosh Hashanah,when in the synagogue fiyyutim’ versified prayers, as king for give ness, arechanted during the wee hours of the morning^, children would stay uptill near midnight and wait for the hour when they might go withparents to the first ‘Slichos.’ They also would arise to ‘Slichos’ dur-ing the middle of the night, and then the night with all its wonderswould be revealed to them. Going to ‘Slichos’ was for them a kindof great heroism. During the month of Elul [before Rosh Hashanah]children poked around the synagogue till they discovered thehiding place of the ‘shofar,’ and tried to learn how to sound it.They blew and blew again, till they got some feeble sound out ofit, weak, but still the sound of the ‘shofar.’And lo, the Holy Day is come, the first evening of RoshHashanah. In the synagogue the children surround the‘Chazzan,’ chorusing to his melancholy chants. When they comehome, they find the table set, and in a saucer the honey which theyhad gone to buy when Mama sent them to the ‘honig-lecker,’honey-dealer. On the morrow they go with all the synagogue wor-shippers to ‘Tashlich’ at the river and its willow trees.Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur there were manyactivities of interest. Mama bought ‘kapporres’ at the market, arooster for a boy, a hen for a girl. The children used to swingthese live ‘kapporah’ chickens around their heads and bring themto the ‘shochet.’ On Yom Kippur eve they would go with their par-ents to make the rounds of friends, neighbors and kinfolk to begfor honey ‘lekach’ [honey cake: a euphemism for going round to make upafter any past disagreements, or simply to wish a happy new year. ]38Sokoiievka /J ustingradtogether, so he takes one child at a time, teaches him by himselffive or ten minutes, sends him off, and seats another child beforehim.

Each one tries to make the next one laugh, sonone should be sad, and all of us laugh together, and Mamalaughs most of all. Truly, that’s how Mama is.FestivalsThe year’s calendar was reckoned by festivals. So many and somany weeks before ‘Pesach’ or after ‘Pesach,’ and likewise withother festivals. That was the date. Certain specific Sabbaths alsoSokolievka!Justi n grad37Both small boys and older sought for adventures. They wentout to open spaces, hunted for junk and all kinds of finds(‘metzios’). They risked their lives rowing on pond waters in bro-ken wooden troughs. Summer time they would go in groups tobathe in the river, and to spend hours in the craftsmen’sworkshops, where they would pick up materials for work and forplay.On y’rid days they would roam the market in packs. When theboys came to the cattle market, they would repeat the Talmudpassage about the “ox which gores a cow,’’ and in their naivetewould wait to see it happen.Imagining: A Sokolievka Child’s StoryToday I will tell you my life, the life of a boy in Sokolievka.What matters that I am child? A child also has his life story. First,please get to know me. My name: Chayyim ben Shmuel benEliyahu from the town of Justingrad-Sokolievka. In short, fromSokolievka.To begin, let me tell you about my father and mother. Myfather’s name is Shmuel ben Eliyahu and my mother’s name isEsther’l. At home, and not only at home. Father looks like a verypreoccupied man who knows none of the joys of life. He walksaround the house like an army officer or commander, expectingthat every order that comes out of his lips will be done at once. Iconfess: I am afraid of papa. But this papa, who gets angry, andeven beats his children, serves as my model in life."^^At this moment, I am going to visit my grandpa. Not every daydo I go to visit grandpa. “Your grandpa is a complete goy,” saysmy mother, because grandpa, a baker of ring cakes by trade,employs gentile apprentices. It would seem, not to be a “completegoy,” grandpa employs me, my brother and his own sons instringing the cakes. We sit in front of a big basket of warm ringcakes, and string them on a thin cord, wTile counting them one tofive in a Yiddish melody, eins, zwei, drei,fier andfinf.My brothers and I study in ‘cheder.’ In the morning, abouteight o’clock, we get up and dress (wash fairly — not exactly), eatbreakfast and walk to ‘cheder.’ In ‘cheder’ we learn rather little.Why? Because the Rebbe is not able to teach all the children36Sokolievka ljustingradassistant to pass out gifts to each child at some holidays: a ‘dreidefat Chanukah, a bow-and-arrow at Lag B’Omer, a wooden swordfor TishaCard playing, like ‘dreidef [gambling for beans or buttons] wascustomary at Chanukah. Older children, in ‘Chumash’ and‘Gemara’ class, who could imitate printed Hebrew lettersbeautifully, used to design their own playing cards, ‘kvitlach.’These were numbered from ‘aleph’ (one) to ‘lamed-beis’ (thirty-two). They inscribed the letter-numerals on ordinary paper,pasted them on heavy packing paper, drying them in the ovens,because winter air was damp. They cut the cards apart, and col-ored them, using crayon pencils blue at one end and red on theother. For yellow they borrowed cinnamon from mother’skitchen. They also made paper purses for collecting ‘Chanukahgelt.’^'^Each holiday had its fun, bows and arrows on Lag B’Omer,‘grager’ noisemakers at Purim. Many and varied were the chil-dren’s games, activities, pleasures.A child beginning to learn to read in the ‘cheder’ would be“tested” by his parents. They would set him before them and tellhim: if you read well, an angel will toss you a penny from heaven.As the boy read, his mother stood behind him, holding the pennyover his head. When the reading went well, she let the penny fallonto the ‘siddur’ and the child was so happy!On winter nights, when the winter stove was lit with straw, chil-dren would spread the straw looking for husks with kernels still inthem, which they toasted over the fire and ate. When motherbought a pumpkin, she let the children split it and take the seedsfor drying.Mother usually shared lighter and pleasant laborswith her boys and girls, in baking, in plucking goose feathers tostuff pillows and bed covers (feather beds), in caring for the goatsthat were in most houses.Girls had games of their own. They played a lot with jacks,‘tsheichen’, using small bone joints of sheep or goats, smooth andshiny from play. The game was like “five stones” which (Israeli)girls play nowadays. Girls were permitted to buy rubber balls atthe Katzap stands, and they bounced them interchanging handsand feet, as they do now. Girls were always closer to home, andhad the burden of house chores.S okolievka /] ustingrad 3 5Children’s Games and PleasuresChildren in Sokolievka had no idea of store-bought toys. Theymade their own toys, and played a great deal. They sought andfound every kind of junk, as well as sticks and stones, branches,leaves and other natural materials.Even in the Rebbe’s ‘cheder,’ as they sat, they found ways ofplay. A child might take a piece of young garlic from his lunch,roll its green leaves till its soft inner fiber was destroyed, then blowinto it with all his strength till it filled with air and stood up like anonion leaf.When the teacher was tutoring one child sitting before him,others would slip out and play all kinds of games. Two, three ormore children stretched out on the ground around a hole playinga button game with great enthusiasm. One who lost all his buttonscould not withstand temptation, would tear buttons off his gar-ments and continue in the game. Buttons were their means ofexchange: with buttons they could buy anything from each other.Their pockets were always filled with buttons, nails, pieces of col-ored glass and so on.On the streets and empty lots you could see children “playinghorse”: one child put a cord in his mouth to serve as bit and reins,and played the horse, the second held the reins and both ran andgalloped; or bigger children ran with little ones on their backs.Children both small and big used to throw stones at a chosentarget, such as the thatch on the Rebbe’s roof. After summerrains, when the streets were full of deep puddles, children com-peted in expert throwing of “ducklings”: a stone thrown parallelto the water surface would dip and rebound in a curve above thewater bouncing till it sank.^^Holidays provided children with a multitude of games and pas-times. From Rosh Hashanah to Succos, the ‘chaleh’ or other bread(over which the ‘Motzi’ blessing was said at the beginning of ameal) was spread with honey: children saved the honeycomb waxand played with it at ‘cheder.’ From the palm leaves of the Succos‘lulav’ they braided finger rings, baskets and mats. As Chanukahapproached, they gathered lead for the teacher’s assistant to castinto ‘dreidels’ (put-and-take spinners). It was traditional for the345 okolievka /] ustingradIn the ChederWhen the boy was three, he was brought to the ‘Cheder.’ Firstthe teacher taught him the names of the letters of the alphabet (allconsonants). Then he taught him to read each letter with thevowel signs, ‘kamets-aleph aw, kamets-beis baw,' aloud from theprayer ‘siddur’. The teacher taught each child individually, inturn, teaching the lesson once, and then giving him to his assistantto go over again. A child spent the whole day in the teacher’shouse. Between one lesson and another, the child might play inthe schoolroom or outside. When evening approached, the assist-ant took all the children together to teach them prayers andblessings, orally. He would ask, “What blessing is said over bread?What blessing is said on wine?” The children would give theanswer in chorus. They learned their first prayers, the ‘KriasSh’ma,’ the ‘Modeh Ani.’ For two or more years the child studiedwith the ‘Dardaki-melamed,’ the primary teacher. Then headvanced to the ‘Chumash-Melamed,’ teacher of the Five Booksof Moses.‘Chumash’ was also studied by the children in unison. They sataround a big table, reading aloud word by word and repeating itstranslation in Yiddish. Thursdays the teacher examined hispupils one by one. Woe unto him who did not pass this testing.At evening twilight the Rebbe would leave the children in the‘cheder’ when he went to the synagogue for evening prayers. Inthe house it grew dark. Afraid as they were of the darkness, thechildren passed the time telling stories of robbers, bandits anddemons. When the Rebbe returned, the light was lit and they satdown to resume study until all were tired. Then the Rebbe sentthem to go home. The Rebbitzin helped the little ones into theirwarm clothing.The children lit candles in their lanterns, went into the streetsounding off out loud a song about little children who study atnight, happy to be grown up enough to study at night, boastingabout their ‘cheder,’ saying good night, and above all, satisfactionthat they were free now to go home. The song began with thewords ‘Baruch Sheptarani,’ “Blessed be he who has liberatedme.”^^ How sweet is freedom!Sokolievka /J ustingrad55least enough bread to share a piece with a poor man. The tea ket-tle whistled, and a glass of hot tea was always ready for any onewho came.A Child Is BornA child was born at home. There were no hospitals. To help thewoman in labor there came a midwife, old and tried.When a son was born, on Saturday night the friends and neigh-bors came over from the synagogue worship for a Shalom Zachar,a modest festivity. The main treat was boiled chickpeas.Friendsmight bring wine for good cheer, especially if the family was poor.The evening before the day of the ‘Bris’ (circumcision), chil-dren of a nearby ‘cheder would crowd into the house, to welcomethe infant into their congregation. Under the leadership of the‘bahelfer’ (assistant to the rebbe-teacher) they would in unisonrepeat the ‘Krias Sh’ma’ and the Guardian Angel blessing (Genesis48:16), and then they would be treated with cookies by the womenin the house. The happy mother lay in her bed behind screeningsheets on which were pinned copies of Psalm 121, (ShirHa-Maalos, A Song of Ascents) as an amulet for good fortune.From the day of its birth, the child was wrapped in swaddlingclothes, not like baby clothes today. These were tight linenwrappings, enveloping the entire baby. Hands were pressedtightly to the body, feet tied together, and the child could notmove a limb. It was funny to see the infant after bathing, when themother had wrapped it in these swaddling clothes and rolled it onthe bed like a roly-poly teddy bear, chirping to it, lovingly callingit Berele, Berele, my little teddy bear. In the cradle the baby wasrocked to sleep with lullabies sung to it. (When a new cradle wasbought for a baby, for good luck the mother would first rock thefamily’s cat in it.)Up to age two, and sometimes longer, there was one kind ofdress for both boy and girl, a wide robe that reached to the heels,rolled up behind so the child should not soil it. In this kind ofdress, clean and festive, the child was brought for the first time tothe synagogue. The child grew up under the devoted care of itsmother, often with the help of older daughters, especially whenthe mother was employed in a store or the market.52S okolievka /] ustingrading room.^® A third of the kitchen was taken up by the oven forcooking and baking. It was tall as a man, wide, and vaulted at top.It was stoked with a wood fire until very hot, the ashes were rakedout, and loaves of bread were put in to bake on weekdays, ‘chaleh’for ‘Shabbos’. On Sabbath eve they would put in the ‘tsholenf, themeal for the Sabbath, and keep it on the flat top to keep it warm.In winter they might sleep on top of the stove.There were no indoor toilets in the house. In the corner of thekitchen hung a basin for washing hands and face, with a tubbeneath to catch the overflow. Adults and grown children usedthe communal bathhouse for bathing. Little children were bathedat home in a wooden trough. Water for household needs was keptin a barrel, near the rear door of the kitchen. Water for the wholetown came from a well near the “Bridge,” delivered once everytwo days by the water carrier. One who wanted a drink of coldfresh water in summer might draw a pailful from one of the otherwells in some of the streets.Besides the big oven, houses had a winter stove, built of granitestone, narrow, plastered and whitewashed, looking as if it werepart of the wall separating rooms. In winter it would be stokedwith wood, straw, reeds, anything suitable for burning. Windowpanes in winter were covered with frost in flowery and other fan-tastic patterns, which delighted the children.At night kerosene lamps hung on the walls or stood on tables togive light. In the dining room or living room large chandeliers {forcandles or oill] hung for light and for decoration.Furniture was simple and solid. Young couples might decoratetheir bedrooms with beds with high backboards, and wardrobeclosets carved in floral designs. No house was without a cradle ofwoven wicker work, hung from the ceiling; or more expensivecradles made by carpenters, with legs on rockers. A clock mighthang on the wall, with pendulum and weights. Sometimes thewalls might be adorned with portraits of grandparents, or distin-guished personalities, such as the Vilna Ga’on, or MosesMontefiore. Some homes hung a ‘Mizrach’ on the eastern wall, atablet with pictures and the word ‘mizrach’ (“east”) to show thedirection faced during prayer.Homes were simple, without luxuries, and often veryimpoverished: but happiness was pervasive. There was always atSokolievka / justingrad31HomeA home passed from father to son by inheritance. As long as theolder folks were alive, married sons resided in the house withtheir parents. If the place was very crowded, a room might berented for a time for the young couple in a neighbor’s house.Most of the houses were of clay, sagging with age. Thecarpenter-builder, most often a gentile, would put up first theframework, wooden beams, post by post. They filled the spacebetween these posts by boards set crosswise. Then they would diga pit in the ground. For a meter down there was the black soil, andthen they would reach clay. The builder would bring women,wives and daughters from the villages to knead this clay with theirfeet, mix it with straw and shape it into blocks. The builder used tostick these blocks of clay to the two surfaces of the wall, beating thelumps with his fists so they would cover the boards, adhere well,and make a straight wall. When the walls were done, they wouldcover the roof with straw thatch.The farmers used to thresh their grain with flails. During thisbeating, the kernels fell separately from the straw and the husks.With this straw roofs were covered. Bundle after bundle of strawwas carried up, and densely tied together by straw knots to thelaths.Roofs were high and steeply slanted, leaving a large attic space,the ‘boidem’. Here were stored the Passover dishes from year toyear, and here were kept the geese in wooden cages while beingfattened. In winter they hung their wash there for drying. The‘boidem’ was a favorite place for children to hide and to playgames.The house was usually in two parts. Half had no ceiling, andserved for storing wood and straw for fuel, for keeping goats andchickens, at times also a horse or a cow. This was the rear side ofhouse, and had a rear entrance towards the kitchen area. Thefront half, with a ceiling (really an interior roof under the‘boidem’) was the residence. The floor was not covered, and everyFriday it would be plastered afresh with bright new clay. The chil-dren were not allowed to enter until it was dry.The house might have a bedroom for the parents, a diningroom and kitchen, sometimes a bedroom for children, and a liv-30Sokolievka ljustingradTsarist regime persecuted Tzaddikim and had marked him forarrest and banishment to a distant part of Russia where therewere no Jews, “Judenrein.” On the eve of the Succos holiday 5628(1868) two hours before police came to arrest him, his Chassidimspirited him away to safety. He succeeded in escaping toRomania, and was active there until his death.Reb Pinchas’l was a great Torah scholar, a saintly and humbleman, all his days devoted to Torah and to worship. He had a fol-lowing of Chassidim in Sokolievka and the vicinity who came tovisit him from time to time, to bring a donation and to ask hisblessing. His house was spacious, with a large dining room. A pathpaved with wooden blocks led from his house to his synagoguewhich was adjoining. The Rabbi had a room or alcove in thesynagogue, on the side, opening to the dais where the Chazzanstood at his pulpit to lead the worship, and he would come outfrom this alcove only for the opening of the Torah Ark and whenhe was called up for a Torah ‘aliyah’.Mr. Yehudah Blank, whose parents’ house was near theRabbi’s, recalls: “The Rabbi’s house was of two stories, large, high,really a palace. Around it was a large courtyard surrounded by atall wood fence. Several kinds of fruit trees grew there, and alsobeds of vegetables. The upper story had nine large rooms,comprising the residence. The lower story had storerooms, andone wide chamber with a huge oven for baking ‘Matzahsh’murah’.^^ (This baking was done on Passover eve, and onlymales took part. As a little boy I began to participate in thisbaking, and my pay was three matzos for our ‘Seder’ night.) On‘Shabbos’ and on holidays, the Rabbi had a table set as a ritualfeast for his Chassidim, especially for those who came from othertowns. (One of these out-of-town followers used to stay over atour house). The Rabbi habitually spoke little, and was senten-tiously brief when he spoke ‘D’var Torah’ (words of Torah) dur-ing the dinner. Sometimes he spoke of his great father. RabbiGedalyahu Aharon. He spoke slowly and softly and his Chassidimfollowers listened very attentively. The Rabbi ate very sparingly.He would taste something, and push the platter away. The Chas-sidim used snatch the leftovers (‘chapp’n sh’rayim’), in the beliefthat anything with the touch of the Rabbi’s hand was greatlyblessed.”[His tragic martyrdom will later be part of our story']5 okolievka /] ustingrad ^ ^There were six synagogues in the town, and each synagoguehad its ‘chazzan’ (cantor), its ‘Ba’al Korei’ (Torah reader) and its‘Shammos’ (sexton). Their maintenance depended on the syna-gogue congregation. An important source of their income werethe holidays and family celebrations: circumcisions,engagements, weddings.From these ‘simchas’ (joyous occasions) many other peopleprofited, the cooks and the bakers, the ‘badchonim’ merry-makers, and musicians. The Sokolievka orchestra was well knownand used to play in neighboring towns and at evening entertain-ments of the landed gentry.Near the courtyard of the Rabbi was the house of the ‘Dayan’, towhom would come questions dealing with the dietary laws(kashruth), executions of contracts, litigation of disputes betweenone man and another, sometimes between a Jew and a Gentile.Also nearby stood the communal bathhouse.The town had four ‘shochtim’ (approved slaughterers forkosher meat) who slaughtered cattle in the town abbatoir, andpoultry, which were brought to their houses. Several of these hadbeen granted ‘smicha’ to ‘paskin shades’ [equivalent to rabbinicalordination, with authority to decide questions of kashruth]. Some ofthem also acted as a Board of Arbitration in disputes between oneand another.According to the recollection of Mr. Peretz Shuman (who set-tled later in Buffalo) in his time there were twelve ‘melamdim’,Hebrew teachers, each with his own ‘cheder’, and all of thempoverty-stricken. Tuition fees paid by parents was extremely low.Children were enrolled in a ‘cheder’ only for half a year at a time,for one ‘z’man,’ one term. Twice a year, at the end of the summerand at the end of the winter, an inter-session time, ‘melamdim’would be going from door to door to convince parents to continueto send the pupils to them.^^The Sokolievka RabbiThe [second and last] Rabbi of Sokolievka, Rabbi PinchasRabinowitz, affectionately known as Reb Pinchas’l, inherited hisrabbinical seat from his father, [the first], Rabbi GedalyahuAharon of blessed memory.Rabbi Gedalyahu Aharon left Sokolievka against his will. The28Sokolievka /] ustingradThe cork was fastened to the top of the bottle neck with a thin wireso that it would not pop off from the gas pressure. Tannerieswere near the river, probably because of their foul smell and largequantity of waste water. Near them were the shops which madeharnesses for horses, saddles, belts and other leather goods.Another industry was making of tallow candles. The storesalready sold stearin candles, but the villages still continued to usetallow. The Jews also used them to massage their heels and limbsthat were frozen in the winter cold.More developed was the weaving of rope from hemp fiber. Thepeasants of the vicinity grew the hemp, and brought the fibers forsale with the remnants of the stalks still on them. The rope makerswould beat these before spinning. The twining of the roperequired a large area, and the twiners used to stretch the ropesalong the street. A typical sight was the children gathering round,offering to turn the big spinning wheel in exchange for a fewstalks of hemp which they needed for their games.Many families made a living from the egg business, which wasin partnership with storekeepers. Buyers would go through thevillages in wagons, stopping at peasant courtyards to buy thehens' eggs, packed them carefully in the wagon between layers ofstraw and chaff, bringing them to merchants’ warehouses. Herethey were “candled” (examined for blood spots by lamplight shin-ing through), classified, packed into wooden crates to be carriedby train to foreign countries.Women bore the burden of making a living together with themen. They tended the stores, traveled from fair to fair, sold fish,fruit and vegetables in the market. Many women used to fattengeese by force feeding so they would yield a great deal of fat. InRussia goose fat was used the way we in Israel use margarine andbutter: spread on bread, dip foods in it, fry with it. Some women,not many, made a living from different trades: sewing,embroidery, knitting, braiding wigs. In one family the daughtersengaged in knitting stockings by machine.‘Klei Kodesh’In Sokolievka there were quite a number of people who hadfunctions involved with the religious life, with worship, with thestudy of Torah, people popularly known as ‘Klei Kodesh.’Sokolievka ljustingrad27The large crowds that came to the fair jammed into the houseswhere food was served. There were also stands in the marketwhich sold food. Jewish women sold platters of meat aspic (leggelatine), a delicacy for the Gentiles. Others sold tea from boilingkettles. (Winter-time,) Gentiles with mustaches stiff with frostwarmed themselves with sweet hot tea.The whole town took part in the fair. Boys and girls stood atvarious points and sold kerosene, matches, and rough-cut Rus-sian machorka tobacco. Housewives strolled among the peasantwomen and bought eggs and chickens. Husbands went out to buystraw for roof covering, or for kindling.Storekeepers from nearby towns also came to the fair. Therewere also stands of xh^Katzaps: these were bearded Russians whosold wares not found in Jewish stores, such as pearl necklaces withcrosses, icons, eyeglasses and toys. They also sold tomatoes, whichSokolievka Jews were not accustomed to eat.Children used to come to the fair, either on errands for theirelders, or just to look on and have a taste of anything. Adding tothe tumult of the market, the goats squeezed in between the wag-ons to enjoy the confusion, to gorge their mouths with the freshgrass and fragrant straw from the peasants’ wagons.Parnossos — How They Made a LivingOne cannot enumerate all the occupations (‘parnossos’) of theSokolievka Jews. They were blessed with many children and theyput their hands to any kind of work to earn a sustenance for theirhomes.In town there were inns with stables for horses and wide park-ing areas for wagons. Merchants passing through, or coming forthe fair, found here lodging for the night and their meals. Therewere many coachmen who made a living transporting passengersto the nearby city of Uman. Other wagoners acted as purchasingagents, buying merchandise in Uman, and delivering to store-keepers in the town (in Yiddish, they were called ‘loifers’, mean-ing “runners.”)There were a number of petty industries. A soft drink plantproduced soda water and a reddish seltzer with the aroma ofviolets, with the brand Fialko (meaning “violet” in Russian).26Sokolievka /] ustingradTo the Rabbi’s Synagogue<r-.-(h)—-To the Post OfficeSketch of Justingrad center, not drawn to scale, Y’rid daysSokolievkaljustingrad25Market Day (“Y’rid”)Every Monday there was scheduled a “y’rid”, a market or “fair”day.That day the face of the town was altogether different. Themain streets and the y’rid spaces reserved were jammed withfarmer’s wagons. Everywhere one could see crowds of people,Jews and Gentiles, busily trading, trying in every way to peddletheir wares to each other.The Gentiles brought their wagons full of grain, garden vege-tables and fruit, and filled the cattle market with horses and cows,goats, sheep and hogs, all for sale. On both sides of the main streetpeasant women displayed their merchandise: strings of onionsand garlic, peas and dried fruit, pitchers of fresh milk andbuttermilk,balls of cheese and slabs of butter wrapped in freshleaves. They sold fruit of the season, cherries and plums meas-ured by the pail, and other produce of village gardens.On their stands shopkeepers exhibited the merchandise oftheir stores, flower-patterned cloth and notions. Graftsmen setup stalls with their handiwork, summer hats, winter hats, shoes,clothing, tinware household utensils, furniture.Grain merchants of the town used to buy grain from theGentiles, vegetable dealers used to buy greens and fruits.Bargain-hunters, men and women, wandered among the farm-ers’ wives and bought whatever came to hand: finished hides,sheets of linen woven at home, balls of wax, hog bristles. May bee-tles (gathered from trees and bushes and sent to makers of med-ical preparations). Part of the bristles and wax were used by localshoe makers.With the money that the Gentiles acquired at the fair, theybought, from the Jewish shopkeepers, white flour, groceries, drygoods, manufactured articles, household utensils and apparel.They would also buy presents for members of the family, all kindsof costume jewelry, personal ornaments, sweets. The bakers ofSokolievka used to bake ring cakes, sweet, sparkling andattractive, for the market. Their children used to string themtogether in the bakery, counting them with a melody to pass thetime. The bakers also sold cake shaped like birds, sea-horses, dec-orated in many colors. No villager left the fair without buyingsome of these for a child awaiting his return home.24Sokolirvka /] ustingradand various households implements: pails for drawing water,pails for milking, pitchers, sieves, candlesticks, lanterns, Chanu-kah menorahs and Purim noise-maker ‘gragers’.^^ In honor ofPesach they polished brass vessels, that is, lined them with tin.There were also tailors, shoe makers and hat makers, workingfor the market, or to order, to suit individual taste. Hats for gen-tile children and their parents had shining visors, while Jews worecaps whose visors were of the same fabric. Making shoes was inlow esteem among the Jews, so their apprentices were mainly sonsof the gentiles.In those days wooden barrels and wooden bowls were mostlyused. Bathtubs were also made of wood. So there were coopers intown to make these vessels. Even the barrel hoops were made ofwood. Drawers of water used to deliver drinking water in largewooden barrels, wearily carried in wagons by scrawny horsesfrom morning to evening, distributing to each home its allotment,and going back to the well for a refill.These trade skills passed from fathers to sons, who usuallyworked alongside of their parents. Work was manual labor, withsimple tools, without power machinery, from morning darknessto evening darkness, but theirs was an honorable livelihood.These craftsmen were in the main devoted to the communalaffairs of the town. Mr. Michael Abramov tells of his fatherJoshua the carriage-maker who was ‘Gabai’ in the Bet HamidrashHagadol,^^ and gave of his time and energy to campaigningamong his acquaintance before the elections for the head of thetown, and the like.Here one may mention Mod Joel’s, who was a jack of all tradesand practiced many skills which no one else in the town did.Yehudah Blank, now of blessed memory, wrote of Mod, hisfather: “He did everything. He engraved on stone, carved wood,wrote and drew street signs, bound books, assembled gadgets forcleansing sheep’s wool. No house was built in Sokolievka forwhich my father did not draw up the plans. Yet in spite of all hisknowledge and many trades, my father drew his bread in hard-ship.”Sokolievka ljustingrad23ties at one time ordered trees to be planted along the streets. Linesof trees were then planted on the main street, and each tree wassurrounded by a tall wood fence as a guard against damage fromwagons and goats. However, most of them were nibbled up by themany goats which roamed freely through the streets.The approaches to the town were, so to speak, enclosed as anEruv: an iron wire was stretched between posts. Thanks to this‘Eruv’, the whole town constituted one jurisdiction under the‘Halacha’ (ritual law) so that it was permissible to carry somethingwithin it from one place to another on the Sabbath.^^A Town At WorkJustingrad was a town of all kinds of craftsmen. Conspicuous atboth ends of the main road were the workshops of the wagonmakers and the forges of the blacksmiths, whose customers in themain were farmers of the countryside round. If a peasant cameinto town with a wagon damaged or broken down on the road, heimmediately found a carriage maker and a smith ready to repairhis vehicle. In those days the villagers’ wagons were made in allparts of wood, including their axles. If these axles were notgreased at regular intervals, they would scorch from the frictionof the wheels.These wheelwrights sometimes built to order different kinds ofhandsome and strong carriages from choice forest woods. Theassembly work, and iron work were done by the blacksmiths, who,on order, also made household furnishings, various kinds oftools, and shod the horses’ hooves. The wheelwrights and black-smiths were husky men, confident of their muscles, and so werepeace-keepers of the town. When a drunken peasant called for afight, these men of skills were ready with a wooden staff or ironrod to maintain order or teach reason to the impudent.Some of the townsmen were woodworking cabinetmakers whoprepared simple furniture for sale in the market on fair days, andthere were others, who, on order, would make fine furniturefrom costlier wood with delicate carving and inlay work. Thesewere ordered only by well-to-do householders and young cou-ples.Several tinsmiths were occupied in repair of kitchen utensils22SokolievkalJustingradThe town was destroyed in the years 5679-5680 (1919-1920)after the end of World War I. In the summer of 5679 the armedbands of Zelyoni fell upon the town and massacred the Jews inpogroms, looting their possessions and killing hundreds ofpeople, especially all the young men. At the beginning of 5680Denikin and his murderers came and inflicted great slaughteramong the Jews, looted the stores and burned the houses. Thetown was almost entirely demolished, and the Jewish inhabitantsfled. The few who remained were massacred a few years later bythe Nazis.The town was wiped out before it became a hundred years old.Appearance of the TownJustingrad sat in the fertile and fruitful black soil of theUkrainian steppes. In winter an endless expanse of white snowspread around the town, and in summer wide fields of grain,abundant with wheat and rye, standing as tall as a man.From the end of the dike (“Bridge”) a long and wide street pas-sed through the middle of the town westward until it met the roadto the village of Popivka. In the lower end of the street, nearer tothe “Bridge”, was the market place. Here were stands for fruitand vegetables, fish and poultry. Here began the rows of storeswhich lined both sides of that street, right and left. On the upperend of the street were residences and most of the workshops ofthe wagon makers and blacksmiths.The stores were small, without signs or show windows. On mar-ket days a low stand would be set up in front of their wide door-ways to display some of their merchandise.This main street and likewise the other streets of the town hadneither pavements nor sidewalks. In the days of autumn andagain at winter’s end when the snow melted, the mud on the“Bridge” and on the lower end of the main street was very deep,up to the wagon wheel hubs. [Automobiles came late to Sokolievka,and were a rare sight].Houses stood apart from each other. They had no courtyardsor gardens or shade trees, except at the home of the ‘gvir’ (local“rich” man) and two or three others. (The gentiles on the townoutskirts had fruit orchards and vegetable gardens.) The author!-Justingrad-Sokolievka(from the traditions of the town)The town was founded in the first half of the nineteenth cen-tury by Jews coming from the village called Sokolovka in Russian,Sokolievka in Ukrainian, a large village on the banks of one of thetributaries of the southern River Bug, at the edge of the boundaryof the Uman district in the Kiever Gubernia. In the days of TsarNicolai I the mass of the Jewish inhabitants were driven out fromthe village of Sokolievka. These banished families crossed overthe dike to the other side of the river, the place where theLipowitz district begins, and built themselves houses on one of theheights. They named the place of their settlement Justingrad, soit appears, after the name of Justina, proprietress of the estatefrom whom they acquired the lots for their houses.The people never quite accepted the name of this settlement.They were people of Sokolievka, they and their forefathers, andso they also began to call the new settlement SoAo/zVr'Aa. The nameJustingrad was used only on official documents and on letters sentby mail. It was inscribed in large letters on the sign of the drug-store and other community institutions.^®From year to year the new settlement grew and became a town.In the year 5612 (1852) there came to settle there our Master,Teacher and Rabbi Reb Gedaliah Aharon. He was then a famousTzaddik in his city of Linitz, and he had many Chassidim [as fol-lowers]. Apparently he sought to encourage the young commu-nity and to strengthen its hands.As time passed, gentiles settled in the surrounding area,occupied in farming. Between them and the Jewish inhabitantsthere developed strong relationships in trade and in occasionalemployment. They were also counted as residents of the town. Inthe population census of 1897, the total number of inhabitantsreached 3,194, of whom 2,521 were Jews, and 673 non-Jews.2120Sokolievka IJ ustingradBaruch Bernsteinin the Kibbutz Library, 1981The Mashabei SadehMemorial BookOur second document is very different. It is a booklet, printedin W^hrG'w, Justingrad-Sokolievka, A Shtetl Destroyed, published in1972. This publication is the joint composition of school childrenof the Kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh, an enclave thirty miles south ofBeersheba, in the middle of the stark and barren Negev desert,where the heroic settlers have created a garden community set ingreen lawns among purple jacaranda trees. The Israeli kibbutz,as a social and economic organization, generally speaking, is ded-icated to production in two directions: magnificent foodstuffs(fruit, vegetables, cattle) and beautiful children. Their attentionto children’s schooling is phenomenal.In the year 5726 (1965-1966) the seventh grade, called the‘Rimon’ (pomegranate) class, accepted a suggestion from theIsraeli Holocaust Memorial Center ‘Yad Vashem’ that they do aproject commemorating one of the destroyed communities.These twelve-year old children sent letters to survivors, mainly inthe United States, and drew on the papers and reminiscences ofthe Kibbutz patriarch, Baruch Bernstein, nominally “retired” butvery active librarian and inspired teacher, a native of Sokolievka.With the help of their school staff, Amadah Or, Ada Shavit andothers, the children wrote up the data they gathered, and theircompositions were edited into this little volume, of which transla-tion into English now follows. This work falls into three phases.The longest part describes typical shtetl life in the years1890-1910. The second phase recounts the modernizing trendswhich began with the twentieth century. Third, and most moving,is the story of the horrible pogroms which end its life.^^1918Sokolievka IJ ustingradI knew no grammar, because this “teacher” himself knew none.But I learned to read right and proper, so I could write addressesin Russian, and in addition to write a Russian translation — I wasalready a professor of languages.Of the ‘Haskalah’ (Enlightenment) movement and its writings,we knew nothing. At that time, such were “Alien Books,” or“taboo-unclean.” One dared not study such books. No one sub-scribed to any paper. The first newspaper we read was just beforethe Russian-Turkish War in 1877, HaTzfirah, (The Dawn), inHebrew, which someone brought from Uman, the “big town”nearest Sokolievka. I was then fourteen. That was the entirerange of culture. There was no physician, no apothecary, noteven any church or priest, not even a post office. Even when I wasalready in America, letters had to be sent through Uman, andreached Sokolievka through the district administrative office atPopivka.When I was thirteen, a Bar Mitzvah, I was already being soughtfor a wedding arranged by a matchmaker. Dad answered that hemust first see my older sisters married, and then he would thinkabout me. Besides, each one had to serve in the military draft.Because I was the oldest of the sons, I had a deferment, but myfather said he must find a guaranteed way for me not to serve. Itcost him some rubles, and I was simply erased from the register,so that I was never born and in fact never will be born. A plaguewill the Tsar know of me. How will he know, when he is inPetersburg, and I am in Sokolievka? There are no talebearers inSokolievka. father did indeed carry out his intent and none of histhree sons served.But in time we had it ten times worse than Gehenna and worsethan serving ten times, as I will describe in my further memoirs.Here the manuscript fragment breaks off.Sokolievkaljustingrad17quite a ‘nebbish’.^^ Since he used to ‘leren’ a great deal, he was bet-ter schooled, so he became quite a thorn in the eyes of the otherboys of his age. He was rather sickly. He died in Buki at the age of35. He left seven children orphans. They are now in Boston withtheir mother who did not remarry.The second year I studied with Berel as buddy with a ‘melamed’in the house of Mordechai the Rov, but with a different‘melamed’, named Avramel Zippes. This Avramel’s daughter isnow in Buffalo: she is Nissel Veladart’s wife Deborah.When I was twelve years old, Reb Shimshon the Rov realizedthat he had no proper ‘cheder’ for his son Chayekel, so he spoketo my father to have me leave that one and have me study withChayekel as a buddy. We would have the same privileges. Hewould also contribute ten rubles a term more than my father andsupply a room for study in his house. With this buddy I continuedto ‘leren’ until my marriage, passing practically all my teen yearsthere.This Rov was a great ‘yachson’ {man of pride in status and kin), agreat scholar, a pious observant Jew. His wife the ‘Rebbitzin’,Chayye Sima, was the mistress of the house. She managed a drygoods store in the house, and they had better livelihood from thestore than from the rabbinate. Their home was open to poorpeople, with the best help they could endeavor to give. Therewere always poor people eating at their table as guests. It was notunusual to have five or six such guests on ‘Shabbos’. They inter-married with the most prominent families. One daughterZipporah is daughter-in-law to Rabbi Jochanan the RatmestrifkerRabbi. Another daughter Treize is wife to a [descendant off^ RabbiIsrael of Mezibozh of blessed memory. In this atmosphere I grewup.You notice that there was then no other schooling available inour shtetl except the ‘cheder’ and the ‘Klois’. In my youngeryears, there was no one who could write an address in Russian.One had to go to the town secretary to have an address written.My father, who was a businessman and saw the world, understoodthat the coming generation would not be able to manage withoutwriting Russian, so he found a young man who knew to read alittle Russian and when L was eight years old, hired him to teachme. What he knew, I mastered in a month’s time. Understandably16S okolievka /J ustingradwould let loose, broke the prayer stands, got into fights pushingeach other, knocked out a window pane, poured out the watercan, slid on the floor and enjoyed other such kid stuff entertain-ments.Berel the Rov’s took me for a pal because Mordechai the Rovhad given a room for our studies. The Rov and my father hired a‘melamed’ for the two of us, for 50 rubles a term. The Rov prom-ised that he himself would also tutor us. To my mother this wasmore precious than anything. Her wish, shared by all piouswomen in those days, was to have her own son become a Rabbi,and she thought this would make a Rabbi of me.So we studied with a ‘Rebbe’ named Abraham Yitzchak Nach-man’s. If he is still alive, may he be the ‘kapporah’, and if he isdead may the earth cast him forth.He was a savage, a murderer.When my friend Berel caught a slap from the Rebbe, heresponded with the heavy ‘Gemara’ volume on the Rebbe’s head.If this ‘Rebbe’ wanted to settle accounts with him, Berele’s motherthe Rebbitzin would run in making a tumult, so they let up. TheRov himself was afraid of Berele. So the ‘Rebbe’ used to let out hisheavy heart to me. A gangster, a murderer he was. I had nodefender, because my mother would not have stood up for me.She said: if the ‘Rebbe’ beats you, probably he has reason to, hebeats you so that you will learn better.So passed a bit of time. I suffered and was silent, till I thought itover and declared a hunger strike. I ate nothing all day, and atnight only a dry piece of bread, till Mother noticed I was passingout. Without saying anything to me, she spoke with the ‘Rebbe’.So he stopped beating me so murderously. My father was too pre-occupied with making a living. He never had a good word for me.That was then the mode. A child had no rights, only disciplineand accusations thrown up, “Moshe Berestetski’s boy learnsbetter, writes better.”That boy was really exceptional. He was born an old man, andall his behavior was of an old man. He never played with children.He could stay put by the ‘Gemara’ eight to ten hours on end, and‘leren’, or sit six and seven hours and write. He was an only child,his parents had no other children. He was built tall and thin, andwith a born talent for ‘lernen’ and writing, but he had no greathead for worldly matters, or to converse with a person. He wasSokolievka /] ustingrad15‘davenin’. Returning from the synagogue, he no longer needs theshoes. After lunch the ‘Rebbe’ lies down for a nap. The ‘Rebbitzin’dons the shoes, takes a stocking and four knitting needles andgoes to spend the day with a neighbor on her ‘prizba’. Towardsevening she comes back to cook supper. The ‘Rebbe’ takes theshoes and goes to ‘daven mincha-maariv.’^^ Well, do they needtwo pair of shoes? Mottekel goes quite barefoot eight months ofthe year.A year passed. A fire broke out. The ‘Rebbe’s house burneddown with the three-legged goat and the lucky shoes. But the‘Rebbe’s goat proved to be more ‘mazeldik’ (lucky) than the shoes,because the ‘Rebbe’ salvaged one horn to make into a ‘shofar’. Ithink this ‘shofar’ is preserved in a Russian museum. They used tosay this goat was a ‘gilgul’ (reincarnation) of Isaac’s ram, and thatis why it was burned, like the ram substituted for Isaac.This ‘Rebbe’ moved away to Tolna. I was almost nine, andneeded a higher level teacher.In the second house from us dwelt Mordechai the Rov.“^ Hehad a son a year or two older than me. He was also a wild fellow.To give you and idea of what is meant by a “wild fellow.” Summertime he liked to go swimming in the ‘Teicl)’ as much as possible.When a ‘goy’ would bring horses to the ‘Teich’ to drink, he wouldmount on one and lead the other with a rope, both horses into thewater for a dip.^^ When these were bathed, he would take anotherteam of horses into the water, and so all day. When a wagon wentby, he would hitch on for a ride. He used to pal around withragamuffin youngsters. When a Gypsy came to town, leading atrained bear to do tricks, he was the first to lead all the barefootboys running after the bear, or after the dogcatcher chasingstrays. He also used to catch the best spankings from his father,but still he did what he wanted. He had little fear of the Rov,because his mother shielded him.I never had any companions among the ‘mark yung’, the mar-ket youth. A market youth meant a loafer who would not go toschool to learn to read and write, or ‘davenin’, nor learn a trade.These market youths grew up bums, more than half of them wild.It was a disgrace for a decent child to associate with them. I hadmy juvenile mischief moments in the ‘Klois’ and in the ‘BessMedrash’ when the older folks left, each to his affairs. We boys14 S okolievka IJ ustingradElyakum’s, Meier the tinsmith’s son, David Chayyim’s (a cousin ofmine)d^The ‘Rebbe’ here had a boy Mott’l, they called him Mottekel.He was a wild one. This ‘Rebbe’ owned a house, a ‘Rebbitzin’, agoat and a Mottekel. The first, the house, was dilapidated, with athatched roof. When it rained, it was a picnic, we didn’t have tostudy, because the rain ran right on to the table. They would setout troughs, pots and pans to catch the rain. The second, the‘Rebbitzin’, had an affliction in the nose, which constantly bledand ran. The ‘Rebbe’ said this was ‘mereeden’, so we believed that‘mereeden’ (hemorrhoids) was a condition of the nose.Their goat had three legs, because one had been chopped off.On its neck it wore an embroidery hoop, or a rim from a sieve, sheshould not be able to suckle herself.The fourth part of the ‘Rebbe’s fortune, Mottekel, was a firstclass ice skater. He used to steal a sheepskin jacket from one of thepupils, put on the ‘Rebbe’s shoes and go skating on the ‘Teich.’ Onhis return, the Jacket had no sleeve and the ‘Rebbe’s shoes nosoles. He would throw down the Jacket and run away to Konela toan uncle for three days, and the ‘Rebbitzin’ had to go to Konela,five verst away, to collect her one and only son.^®I remember the ‘Rebbe’s shoes because they were of Austrianleather, and inherited from his father Yossi-Motel’s. When hisfather was dying, comatose, he put on his father’s shoes to acquirethem before his father’s passing, they should not be regarded as adead man’s shoes. When the shoes wore out, the ‘Rebbe’ had hisown awl and cobbler’s thread, and used to repair them till thereremained from the original shoes only a patch on a patch. Heused to say these were “lucky shoes,” that he had nothing in thehouse but this one pair of shoes. Really, why does one need twopair of shoes?The official shoe routine of the day: the ‘Rebbe’ rises in themorning, puts on these shoes and goes down to the ‘Teich’Just asPharaoh used to go to his ‘Teich.’ The ‘Rebbitzin’ is still sleeping.The ‘Rebbe’ returns, sits down to tutor the children, so he doesnot need the shoes. He sits in stocking feet. The ‘Rebbitzin’ nowputs on the shoes and goes to market to buy something for break-fast, returns from market and starts her cooking. The ‘Rebbe’puts the shoes on and goes to the synagogue for the morning5 okolievka /J ustingrad ^ dso whispering and winking we soon had nicknames. Raphael theShochet’s son we called “Lekesh,” which fitted him. Chayekel wecalled “Abba,” Yaakov we called “Reish,” and me, “Kohen.” The‘Rebbe’ we called “Bardala” (little beard). In fact he did have a lit-tle goatee beard. And so we used to repeat after him the words of‘Gemara’, not understanding the content, but chanting aloud likea poll parrot.While in this schooling we still had need for play, so I used tobring ‘bukser’ pods from our store, and swap them for buttons.This trading went on under the table.The ‘Rebbe’ had undertaken to teach the whole ‘Gemara’ andhe left the ‘davenin’ to us. Naturally we skipped the ‘davenin’. Sothe winter season passed. On one fine ‘Shabbos’ day, father tookme along, intending me to chant along with him from his ‘siddur’.Oy, oy! I had forgotten it all. Well, he handed me a ‘sholem-aleichem’, a fine howdy-do, with a slap. I start to cry. His neighboron the next seat, Rav Reb Shimshon asked him: “Why do you hitthe child?” Father: “He has forgotten all the ‘davenin’ he used toknow!”Rav Shimshon thereupon called over his Chaykele, asked himto recite a verse in Hebrew, “Oy, yet a greater disaster!” They callover the other two boys, and the same result. [They turn to] the‘melamed’, who argues “I have been occupied with teaching the‘Gemara’. The ‘davenin’ I left to them.” Now the three fatherstalked it over, and decided we have to be given back to Meierka tore-learn basic Hebrew. You can imagine our humiliation beingput back from ‘Gemara’ to the primary school ‘melamed’. Weboys agreed among ourselves that under no circumstances wouldwe go back to the ‘dardaki-melamed’, so it was arranged for himto come to our ‘cheder’ for an hour each day and haye us recite ajfew pages of Hebrew. He came now without his cat-o-nine-tails,which he really did not need for us, because in two weeks we werereading the Hebrew well. We only needed a refresher. Of the‘Gemara’ which we studied, we knew about as much as a presidentof an American synagogue congregation, or precisely, whichweekly portion of the Torah was due to be read this ‘Shabbos’.So a year went by. The second year, we split up. It was too far togo to that ‘cheder.’ So I studied at Benny Issis’, the third housefrom ours. Here I had other friends: Berel the Roy’s, Gedalya12S okolievka I Justin gradfor the child. The unfortunate child in ‘cheder’ had to ‘nebech’eat a dry bit of bread or go quite hungry. So when the childrenwere dismissed to go home, the ‘bahelfer’ would read them the‘krias-sh’ma’ [bedtime prayer, i.e., intimidated them] that they mustnot talk out of school.It once happened to me, that mother sent my cooked foodalong with the ‘bahelfer’ who ate it up and forgot to leave me evena little bit of bread. As I became good and hungry, I began to crybitterly. The ‘Rebbe’ saw I was crying without any “what for,” andsince I was afraid to tell the truth he improved me with the cat-o-nine-tails. The ‘bahelfer’ knew why I was crying. When the ‘rebbe’was out for a minute, the ‘bahelfer’ let me go, but warned me notto tell my mother about the cooked food. When I came home, mychildish understanding carried me away to tell Mother that it hadbeen good, so I said it had been very good ‘rosselfleish’ (potroasted meat). Said she: “What ‘rosselfleish’? it was knishes, sixbig knishes.” I broke into tears. So Father took me under cross-examination and figured out that I had fasted all day.I was considered one of the ‘nagidishe’ (wealthier) children, soFather sent for the ‘Rebbe’ and gave him a full report. The‘Rebbe’ began to beat the ‘bahelfer,’ the ‘bahelfer’ struck back.Mother who was a ‘Tzidkaniss’ (pious and charitable woman)spoke up for the poor young ‘bahelfer’ and made peace. But Iwon a victory: none of them beat me any more.I could write about other episodes from ‘cheder’ but enoughfor now. Well, I am six years old and Dad is seeking a ‘Gemaramelamed’ for me.^^To find a ‘Gemara melamed’ was not hard, but Dad sought asatisfactory ‘cheder’ with good fellow students, not just any one atall. So he talked it over with grownups who had children of myage. These boys were Yaakovka, son of Rabbi Gedalyahu Aharon;Chayekel, son of the Rav Reb Shimshon; and Hershel-the-Sho-chet’s boy Raphael. I made a fourth. They hired a ‘melamed’ forus, Nissil, a Stavitsher, and rented a room for this ‘cheder fromAlter the ‘Gabai’. All four used to go together to ‘cheder’ and this‘Rebbe’ began to teach us ‘Gemara’.I remember the first lesson. He began in ‘Bova Metzia’ with thepassage “Reish Lekesh said, following Abba Kohen Bardala.” Tous clowns the name “Abba Kohen Bardala” was very funny, andSokolievka I JustingradIIdown, the board sagged. There were four or five such benchesand on each board twenty children were seated. The Theder’included over a hundred children in ages four to eight. Therewere tables, of two boards nailed together, a little higher than thebenches. At each table sat two ‘bahelfers’, at each end. The tableswere nine ‘eilen’ (ells). Sitting at each, on both sides, were ten‘kaddishlech’, like lambs to the slaughter.This was the first class, where beginners learned the ‘aleph-beis’ (alphabet). The ‘bahelfer’ sat with a whip of eight thongs inhis left hand and a pointer in his right. Every so often would beheard another squeal from a lambkin whom the ‘bahelfer’ hadhonored with his cat-o-nine tails on the bare skin, because theimpoverished children did not wear any ‘penselech’ or “meit-kelech’. Their clothes consisted of a long shirt of coarse linen,with an ‘arba-kanfos’ and an old ‘yarmelka’ of their fathers’.The second class had an older ‘bahelfer’ who reviewed the‘Chumash’ (the Five Books of Moses) with the older children. Athis table the wailing did not let up, because “In law there is nocompassion,” {Ain rachamim badin).In the third class the Rebbe himself sat at the table and taughtRashi (the Bible commentary) to the children. He was strict andsevere. If you caught his eye, your blood would freeze. No childleft his table without some marks on his body. No child dared to/go out without permission from ‘Rebbe’ or ‘bahelfer’. Still theydid have to let some children go out because the place wascramped for a hundred, and there really were not seats enoughfor all. The richer children had the privilege of sitting on thebenches, the poorer on the ground. That was in summer time. Inwinter they were all crowded into one room like herring in a keg.The children were eager for their tutoring turn to come, at leastto be able to have a seat.The tuition fee ranged from 1.50 rubles to 5 rubles for a term.The ‘bahelfers’ received 10 to 15 rubles a term. Every house-holder was responsible to give a ‘bahelfer’ [each year] one week’s‘kest’ (dinner as guest at table) and ‘Rosh Chodesh Gelt’ (first ofthe month tip) of two to five kopeks. When the alleys were miredor the weather very cold, the ‘bahelfers’ had to carry little childrento ‘cheder’ and home, on their backs. (Being so poorly paid) theymight eat up the cooked food which a mother would send along10Sokolievka /] ustingrad(examining official). He asked: “Your n3.mc?'' Joseph. “Father’sEphraim. “Family name?” Wegodner. “How many broth-ers?” I am the first, and there is a one year old infant girl.“Then you are only two males, your father and you, and fromtwo such no recruit is supposed to be taken. But where is the sec-ond boy who was with you together? Isn’t he your brother?”He is not my brother. He is a stranger that the 'chappers' seized to palmoff as my brother.“Well, where is he?”He is gone. The 'choppers' themselves let him go when his father showedup and paid 300 rubles frr his release.The ‘chappers’ were stunned by this answer, but the sledevatlmore readily believed the boy than the ‘chappers’ and orderedthem arrested. The inquiries were repeated several times andafter some more to do, my father was released. Meanwhile myuncle Yaacov took another family name, and for the rest of his lifewas known as Weinberg.In time, Yaacov bought the Wegodner house from the otherheirs, when all were already married, and set up a store in front.Uncle Velvel took over the inn and the wine business. All thathappened when I was a child.My History as I Recall from Childhood to NowI was born in 5623, the 8th day in Cheshvan, as I know from myBar Mitzvah, November 1862. We were five children: two sistersbefore me, Hannah and Deborah. I am the oldest of the sons. Ihad a brother Shmuel Abba, and a brother Ephraim who livesnow in New York with his family.® The other children are alreadygone.When I was four they sent me to a ‘dardaki-melamed’ (primaryHebrew school teacher) named Meierka. In two years time Ialready was graduated with a diploma saying that I knew how to‘daven’ well.^I would like to describe Meierka’s ‘cheder’ for you. The ‘cheder’was in a large house, without a ceiling. The ground was coveredwith bare clay which the ‘bahelfers’ (teacher aides) spread out fora floor. Wooden floors were not in use in any houses. Thebenches were simply boards laid on four legs. When a child satSokolin'ka / justiograd9and his brother then eleven and a half, one fine evening theresuddenly arrived ‘chappers’ from the Berdichev ‘kehillah’ andtook both children away that night, chained them with shackles,and carried them off towards Berdichev. Grandfather and thefamily were helpless to interfere. At that time there was no rail-road yet. They traveled by horse. When they had travelled about100 verst (65 miles) it was approaching Friday eve. These ‘chap-per-grabbers’ would not travel on the Sabbath — such a crime asdesecrate the Sabbath by travel they would not commit. Theystopped in a village about 50 verst [about 35 miles\ from Berdichev.‘Nu, Shabbos is Shabbos,’ the Sabbath is the Sabbath. The‘chapper’-grabbers gave orders for fine Sabbath preparations;‘davinned’ (recited) the evening liturgy, made ‘kiddush’ (blessingover the wine) from a big goblet, with a good schnapps, and cele-brated a good time, because they had packed in two victims at atime. When they were well soused, they lay down on the floor tosleep. The two children were bound together by the feet, and myuncle was laid next to one of the ‘chappers’, his little foot chainedto the ‘chapper’s’ paw. The children lay awake, and when the‘chappers’ were soundly asleep, the little fellow cautiously slippedhis foot out of the shackle, and both slipped quietly out and away.A little distance off there was a little bridge to cross, where theysaw some peasant lads spending the night in the meadow. Theboys asked directions to some Jewish dwelling. The peasant boysfully understood the situation and gave good directions, to a locallandholder.They found their way there and knocked on the door. Therecame out a clean-shaved man, at which the boys burst into tears, infear they had made a mistake, because in those years it was rarefor a Jewish man not to be bearded. But he was Jewish, and hecalmed their fears. He took a hammer and chisel and broke offthe chains, fed them, harnessed up two good horses, to carrythem off to some secure place.Meanwhile the ‘chappers’ had become aware of the fugitives,called village police, reached the landholder’s house. He tried toput up a fight, so my uncle managed to get away, but my fatherwas retaken. The ‘chappers’ carried him to Berdichev, where hewas confined, pending health examination and induction proce-dures. Here he was kept three months.After three months my father was brought before sledevatl8SokolievkalJustingradwas held responsible. Also it was permitted to a ‘kehillah’ to buy asubstitute replacement. That meant they could hire some kind ofvagrant tramp for a certain sum to volunteer for army service.This helped the richer families to buy themselves out. Sometimesthe ‘kehillah’ would assess a tax on every family for this purpose.Naturally it was not very respectable people who were chosen assuch paragons, because a decent person would not accept such apost. The shepherds of the flock scented a fat morsel here. Theyimposed heavy taxes on the poor families, and when they couldnot pay their children or their orphans were taken and turnedover for soldiers. The wealthier bought themselves off, whilethose who had access to the dish divided up the money.To this end they would send out ‘chappers’ (snatchers, grab-bers) with the permission and the help of the government, tobring in living merchandise. When the ‘chappers’ (grabbers)came into town, there arose a tumult; it was like a pack of wolvesfalling on a flock of sheep. Sometimes they seized a victim whowas an only child in his family, whom they were not supposed totake, so they would invent a ruse, list an imaginary brother or two,and so take him.^When the Jews were driven out from the crown shtetls, underNicolai I, some shtetls were given a respite, not to have any sol-diers taken for ten years. This was enjoyed only by those personswho were enrolled in the Sokolievka census. Grandfather’s familywas enrolled in the Berdichev census, so they did not share thatprivilege.^I myself remember when there used to come ‘chapper-grab-bers’ from the Berdichev ‘kehillah’, my father would go awayovernight to another family, in fear for himself, even though hewas already father of five small children. One could believe any-thing of those ‘chappers’. Even though the ‘chappers’ were hated,still a ‘kehillah’ would employ such characters in order to meet thequota of soldiers rigidly imposed by the government.(This decree lasted into the time of Alexander II. Then wasworked out a law, the Manifest of 1874, that each one must go intomilitary service at age twenty-one. Not everyone had to go attwentyone: an only son, or the oldest son, or any whose brotherwas already in service, was exempt. From the rest a certain per-cent were taken by lottery).In that time of Nicolai the First, when my father was thirteen5 okolievka / Justin grad /Well aware that it would be a difficult struggle to convert Jews,he issued an ukase to draft little children into the military service.The ukase required that each father who had two sons must yieldone to be taken; from each with more sons, two would be taken atthe age of eight and up. This ukase was sent to every town andvillage, directing that in every place a draft commission be set up,empowered to use police aid to seize the children. So in everytown was set up a ‘kehilla,’ (community board) to do this devilishwork. ‘Chappers,’ (grabbers, kidnappers) were hired to snatchchildren of eight and even seven years age and bring them to thedistrict assembly point to be assigned as soldiers.These little children were shipped deep into Russia andhanded to peasants to raise up to the age of eighteen, thrust inamong strangers and compelled to apostasize. You can imaginethe suffering of a child taken from his mother’s apron, sent athousand miles away, not knowing the Russian language,repelled by the food. Often the peasant hardly had food for hisown children: having a strange child, and yet a Jewish child, quar-tered on him, you can imagine what happened to the Jewish child.A great number died from starvation, or from beatings. No onecould demand an accounting for their blood, because their par-ents had no idea where their child had been taken. The youngerones were simply baptised. The older ones who refused to “con-vert” were subjected to such tormenting that there remained veryfew who were not “converted.”Under Nicolai I such a soldier could say good-bye to life. Up toage 18, he was considered in training, and then he was required toserve for 25 years. Any one who might survive to find his way“home,” after this term of service, was old and broken down,without any trade to make a living. When parents had a child sotaken, he was considered gone forever, and so parents wouldrather pray a quick death for their child than have him endurethat dragged out agony. It is reported that Nicolai had said itwould be enough if from a hundred such children there wouldremain one soldier available for service.How long the period continued when this decree was in effect,I do not know exactly. {Forty years. L.M.) Some time later (duringthis period) the decree was revised to require each Jewish ‘kehi-llah’ to supply, each year, 5% for military service and the ‘kehillah’65 okolievka /] ustingradHe then went directly home, and fifteen steps from home hebegan to feel bad, and felt the cramps coming on. When he cameinto the house, he flung himself on his bed, and as he felt himselfgetting worse, so Uncle Chayyim took a turn for the better. Bythree o’clock grandfather was dead, and Uncle was recovering.This happened Simchas Torah in the year 5627 (1866), the sameday that my mother gave birth to my brother Ephraim.Grandmother Chayye lived another eight years.My father Joseph was brought up in the spirit of those years:studied in ‘cheder’ and in the ‘Bess Medrash’, no other schooling.^But he taught himself to write Yiddish, and was a good writer inYiddish when 90% could not, and to do accounts on an abacus (often wires with ten wooden rings, which was then in use). A major-ity then could not write numerals. Also there was a question ofpaper, of which they were very sparing.My father had an aptitude for business, a clever man. He set upthe first general store of groceries and furnishings, which hecalled a ‘Bakaleyena and Galanterie Artevie’. This business heconducted at home. “Home” consisted of two rooms and akitchen. Below there was a cellar, and that was the store. (I wasthen not quite six). One night it was broken into and everythingwas stolen. Later a deal was made with the thieves to return thestock for 200 rubles, a great fortune that was. Well, the thievestricked him out of the money, and at night brought back casesfilled with flint stones. Father lost everything. He also sufferedhaving to pay off paper notes at interest as high as 50% perannum.^Kidnapping Children for the Tsar’s ArmyTo give you a grasp of the further narrative, I must firstdescribe the circumstances which then prevailed under the Tsarsof the Romanoff dynasty. In 1825-1855 the throne was occupiedby Nicolai Pavlovich, Nicolai the First, after the death of his olderbrother Alexander, who had warred with Napoleon, Emperor ofFrance and defeated him. This Nicolai was an extreme anti-semite, and also very ferocious, like his ancestor Ivan the Terri-ble. Seeking to cozy up to the Church, and to cover up his crueltiesto the Russian citizenry, he undertook to proffer Jewish souls tothe Church.Sokolievka I Justin grad ^wife Rachel, whom he divorced when my father was three andUncle Jacob was li^). His widow remained with six children ofher own, three sons, Velvel, Aaron, Abraham, three daughters,Sarah, Perel, Nessy. Uncle Velvel’s first born was Samuel Wegod-ner, who died in Buffalo in 1921. Velvel had four daughters,Chayye, Rebecca, and Aidel in Chicago; in Eretz Yisroel, Miriam,whose husband is Nathan Berdichevsky.My father took over the wine business, and built a separatedwelling for himself, with his business in the same house.My father’s mother Rachel (who was divorced by grandfatherEphraim) married again but had no more children. In her oldage, after her second husband died, she moved in with herchildren, and died in my father’s house at age 71, after mywedding.My mother’s father was called Shmaia (Jacob Samson) and hermother Chayye, from the same town Sokolievka. His business wassalt. They had two children, my mother and a brother Chayyim.This brother Chayyim was a great iamdan’ (scholar) and a ‘cho-chem’ (learned man). He inherited his grandfather’s property,but he had no aptitude for business, and quickly became poor.Grandfather Shmaia died when I was four years old, from theBlack Plague, which was then epidemic in our area. Hardly anyhome failed to give its sacrificial victims to the Angel of Death.What I am going to tell you now is no legendary fantasy. It istrue fact. When the plague was rampant it reached grandfather’shouse. It carried off Uncle Chayyim’s wife and two children.Then it seized Uncle Chayyim. He lay down sick on SimchasTorah morning. Picture to yourself the grief of the parents, nowalso about to lose their treasured only son.At that time there resided in our town the Tzaddik RabbiGedalya Aharon (the grandfather of the Monastrishtsher RabbiRav Yehoshuala who now lives in New York).^Grandfather ran to the Rabbi with a great outcry. The Rabbiwas then seated at table with many Chassidim. Grandfather sob-bed and cried out, “If I must give another sacrificial victim frommy house, I want myself to be the sacrifice, and all of you. Rabbiand ‘Yeeden’ sitting here be my witnesses, join in blessing me to beexchanged for my son, my head for his, my hand for his, everylimb, I bring a bottle of wine for all of you to pledge this to me.”4Sokolievka ljustingradThese Jews were then so impoverished that they did not evenhave funds to pay to transport their personal possessions across‘De Brick’. They took their houses apart, used the best wood tomake rafts, spread out whatever they had not been able to sell andso floated this “fortune” of their across the water.This took place the day after ‘Pesach’ (Passover). To their mis-fortune the weather was very bad, rainy and cold. The weakerwomen and children were taken into a large house which hadbeen erected some time before, with a large courtyard. Thishouse belonged to Chayyim Lichtzieher, Chayyim the CandleDipper. He had a little manufactory there where he himself madetallow candles, in those days our only lighting. A few womenconvalescing from childbirth were taken into the house. Eachperson’s best possessions were piled together in the large court-yard. The rest of the people made shelters of straw, or holes in theground, to protect themselves from the rain and the cold. Nosooner was this set than ‘helft Gott’, God helps, and on Fridayevening fire broke out in Lichtzieher’s house. Everything went upin flame. Nothing was left, no bedding, no chair, no table, amound of ashes.[In spite of this unhappy beginning, these villagers proceeded to helpthemselves.] At that time there was famine in Russia. Russian con-struction workers came, working for their bare meals. If theyearned a few rubles, they boozed it up. The town was practicallyall built that summer.My grandfather Ephraim built a large inn and hotel for peopletravelling through. In those years there were no railroads yet.Traffic moved by horse and wagon. He also had a wine store. Heused to travel to Bessarabia to buy wine to sell in other shtetlach inthe vicinity. He also was a fine ‘chazzan’, (cantor). He used to rideout for the High Holidays to Nicolaiev and there earn 200 rubles,then a high rate [chanting the synagogue liturgy.] He used to singwith the famous Tzalel, the Odessa ‘chazzan.’^He died in middle age, at fifty-five, in 1867. I, Ephraim’sgrandson, was then three and a half and barely remember him.My father was then about twenty-seven.Ephraim’s widow took over the house and the business of theinn. She was a second wife, not mother of my father or his brotherJacob. (My father and Jacob were the children of Ephraim’s firstThe Wegodner ManuscriptRecollections of the Days of My Youth which I began to writeon the day sixty-seven years are completed from the day I wasborn; also what my forefathers told me of their times so that itmay be told to later generations.Exile and New HomeI have begun to write my history, also the history of my parentsat the request of my children: my recollections, and what my par-ents told me: Levi, son of Joseph Wegodner and Hudel, daughterof Avigdor Mintzer.My father’s father was Ephraim Wegodner, (and his father’sname was Joseph). Ephraim dwelt in the town of Sokolievka, inKiever gubernia, Russia, in the time of the Russian despot Alex-ander the Eirst; and after him the Russian throne was occupied byhis brother Nicolai the First (may his name be effaced!). Nicolaithe Cruel issued a ukase, a decree, that Jews were not permitted toreside in ‘kaziana’ (crown) towns or villages. They could stay onlyin areas which belonged to ‘preetzim, pannes’ (feudal lords).So the town of Sokolievka was driven out, although it had stoodon government land hundreds of years. I myself have seen atombstone there dated over 300 years old.Fortunately the Jewish population did not have to wander far,only across the ‘Teich,’ a mile wide. There lay an unoccupiedspace which was the property of a ‘preetza,’ a woman of the nobil-ity. The old ‘preetza’ was satisfied that these Jews should settle onher territory. It would give her a town, which would yield muchmore income than unsettled land. It was also an honor to have atown in her estate. This moved her to help each one, lendingmoney, and timber from her woodlands to build their houses.Each one had to pay for a site to build a house. This took place inthe years 1840-1850.52Sokolievka /] ustingradlocal lord who was master around Sokolievka, had title to vacantland on the western side of the “Bridge”, then open space, withonly two houses. Eager not to lose their income from this hard-working community, the ‘poritz’ and the ‘preetza’ suggested thatthese new exiles simply go across ‘De Brick’ and re-settle there. Sothey did, and they named the new settlementJustingrad, in honorof the ‘preetza’, whose name was Justina.And so we begin with our first document, the Wegodner Manu-script. This document, twenty-three bittersweet pages handwrit-ten in Yiddish, was set down about 1929, by Levi Wegodner, anative of Justingrad/Sokolievka, then resident in Buffalo, NewYork, at the request of his children on the occasion of his fiftiethwedding anniversary. In the beginning . . }Hudel and Levi Wegodner(Mr. & Mrs. Louis Wagner)Sokolie vka/J u stingradCenturies ago, none of us knows exactly when, there alreadywere Jewish families making their home in Sokolievka, a little vil-lage in the Ukraine, but their written history begins only in theearly nineteenth century. It begins in agony, and it ends barely ahundred years later, in tragedy.Where was Sokolievka? It was sort of on a line 120 miles southfrom Kiev, 160 miles north from Odessa, but those were far awayplaces, remote from Sokolievka’s villagers. For them the big townwas Uman, about twenty miles to the south. Local geography wasmore meaningful, centering on ‘Der Teich’, the River, and ‘DeBrick’, the Bridge. Actually the ‘Teich’ was a pond, formed artifi-cially by a dam or dike across a stream that came through the vil-lage of Popivka to the southwest, and ‘De Brick’ was really thisdam of earth and brushwood, a quarter of a mile long across the‘Teich’. At the eastern end was Sokolievka, at the western end wasJustingrad, and that is the beginning of the story.This history begins in the despotic reign of Tsar Nicolai theFirst, who could think of no better way to placate the restless serfsand oppressed peasants of Russia, and keep them quiet, than toissue decrees: Jews who live in certain villages must move. Whereto? No matter. Just move. In Sokolievka there were perhaps threedozen Jewish families when this ukase hit. Where to go? Theywere in ‘gains’*, in exile, some of them since the Babylonian war2500 years ago, some since Roman times 1700 years ago. Theirforefathers had wandered a weary and trackless way throughrealms and kingdoms long forgotten, Parthia, Byzantium, Gra-nada, Burgundy. Where to, now?At this critical moment, a blessing. The ‘preetza’, wife of the* Throughout this volume the last letter of the Hebrew and Yiddish alphabet is representedby an s wherever it was so pronounced in Justingrad / Sokolievka.1Family group picture taken in Sokolievka 1912 on the eve of the departure forAmerica of newlyweds David Feldstein (1884-1964) and Adella Logvin Feldstein(1892-1973), standing left. Seated center, Adella sparents, David Logvin (d.1916?) and Blume Leah Logvin (d. 1937, Brooklyn): she was blinded in a 1919pogrom.

Theirchildren, front, Seymour Logvin, Gertrude Logvin Srebrenik and Iiwing Logvin,escaped from the pogroms to America, and with their families are still contributingto this country's cultural and economic well-being (see p. 66 and note 74).ForewordMany books, and not nearly enough, have been composed totell the story of the Holocaust of 1933-1945, and in a sense,this book is part of that story. But the saga of struggle, suffer-ing and survival begins long before then, and will surely notbe ended very soon.This is the story of a shtetl which had a life of barely a hun-dred years, of simple hard working people, who each nightgave thanks they had managed to live through one more day,said their krias-sh’ma and went to bed. Even so, they had astory of their own, from which are here preserved only a fewmoving chapters, which we put together as a testimony insteadof a tombstone, as a beacon.7th Day in Av, 5743D. F. M.L.
