Digital Approaches to Reading Postwar Memorial Books from Jewish Europe

This is a collection of code designed to be reused and adapted to other forms of inquiry into the corpus of *yizkor bikher*, memorial books published by the Eastern European Jewish diaspora in the wake of the Second World War.

## Online Collections

This project relies upon the work of librarians, digitization technicians, and web developers to describe, scan, and provide access to hundreds of volumes.
